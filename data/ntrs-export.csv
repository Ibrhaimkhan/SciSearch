20240006986,BOOK_CHAPTER,Women’s Health in Spaceflight: Life Beyond Low Earth Orbit ,"[""S Puukila"",""J S Alwood"",""L K Christenson"",""A E Ronca"",""J Steller""]","Historically, only 75 women have flown in space and while this inequity has been recently addressed with astronaut candidates about 50% female, research defining female biological responses to spaceflight remain limited. The NASA Artemis Campaign aims to land the first woman on the Moon for purposes of scientific discovery, technology advancement, and learning how to live and work on another world in preparation for human missions to Mars. The need to understand how sex and gender affect a wide range of physiological functions, impacting numerous health outcomes is critical. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize recent findings in women’s health in spaceflight, past studies examining female mammalian responses to spaceflight and highlight the need for additional studies to help reduce risk and enhance countermeasure development specific to female astronauts. The promise of artificial intelligence approaches for advancing the pace of research is discussed with the caveat that, at present, fundamental research on women’s health in space and sex-specificity of response to spaceflight stressors is not sufficiently robust to achieve this goal.","[{""submissionId"":20240006986,""isbn"":""9780443222597"",""publisher"":""Elsevier"",""id"":""2126f3e3ec7a49a090f6a0bae3dc1c98"",""eisbn"":""9780443222603"",""publicationName"":""Precision Medicine for Long and Safe Permanence of Humans in Space"",""publicationDate"":""2024-11-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""18-18FLAG_2-0028 "",""NNH14ZTT001N""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240006986

Spaceflight-related changes have been reported in the musculo-skeletal, cardiovascular, neurovestibular, endocrine, and immune systems. The spacecraft environment further subjects the traveler to noise and gravitational forces, as well as airborne chemical, microbiological contaminants, and radiation exposure. As humans prepare for longer duration missions effective countermeasures must be developed, verified, and implemented to ensure mission success. Over the past ten years, synthetic biology has opened new avenues for research and development in areas such as biological control, biomaterials, sustainable energy production, bioremediation, and biomedical therapies. The latter in particular is of great interest to the implementation of long-duration human spaceflight capabilities. This article discusses the effects of spaceflight on humans, and reviews current capabilities and potential needs associated with the health of the astronauts where synthetic biology could play an important role in the pursuit of space exploration.","[{""submissionId"":20110014422,""id"":""bae2652e29484f1a9ebe4096746e5216"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""2011CBA00807"",""NNH06CC03B"",""NSF 0830976"",""NNH06CTO38"",""NNX08AX15G"",""NIH RO1 GM36481""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110014422
20040141474,ACCEPTED_MANUSCRIPT,Food and Nutrition in Space: Application to Human Health,"[""Yael Vodovotz"",""Scott M. Smith"",""Helen W. Lane""]","The National Aeronautics and Space Administration begins the new millennium with the hope of expanding human space exploration beyond Earth's orbit. These extended-duration missions (3-5 years) require an in-depth assessment of the critical risks (referred to as ""show stoppers"") to humans when exposed to the remote environment and reduced gravity conditions for such long periods of time. Food, and the nutrition it provides, is paramount to crew health. For short-duration spaceflight (30 days), the nutrient requirements pertaining to physiological adaptations are likely to be satisfied without significant impact on crew performance or health. However, prolonged exposure to reduced gravity, or microgravity, and isolation may alter human nutrient requirements as well as increase the psychosocial role of food/meals in daily activities. An outline of critical questions and related research needs in the area of food and nutrition has been drafted (1) at NASA JSC with the help of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (http://www.nsbri.org). The research areas outlined in this plan will directly impact the success of extended-duration human space missions. Findings from this research will have direct applications to human health issues faced here on Earth.","[{""volume"":""16"",""submissionId"":20040141474,""issue"":""7-8"",""issn"":""0899-9007"",""publisher"":""Elsevier"",""id"":""ff4b767e68594729a02c0085b8357723"",""publicationName"":""Food and nutrition in space: application to human health"",""publicationDate"":""2000-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""issuePublicationDate"":""2000-07-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""url"":""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0899900700003117?via%3Dihub"",""doi"":""10.1016/S0899-9007(00)00311-7""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040141474
20240001874,PRESENTATION,Biomedical Research for Human Spaceflight,"[""Raj Prabhu""]","This invited presentation will offer an overview of the biomedical research – both from a biomedical sciences and engineering perspective – of human physiology and performance during spaceflight. Focused on the unique expertise within the Biomedical Sciences Branch, NASA Johnson Space Center, the talk will elucidate the critical role of biomedical laboratories in synergistic activities in clinical sciences, space physiology, applied research, technology development, and operational support for human space exploration. Together, the efforts within this branch play a crucial role in supporting astronauts' health, performance, and safety. The branch Scientists, Researchers, and Engineers conduct biomedical research in flight on board the International Space Station and on-earth space environment analogs. This dual approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the effects of micro- and planetary gravitation fields on human physiology and the assessment of potential clinical and biomedical interventions (countermeasures) to mitigate astronaut clinical and performance decrements. The talk aims to underscore the synergistic collaborative efforts of biomedical engineers, physiologists, clinicians, and computational researchers, emphasizing these experts' pivotal role in advancing human spaceflight's frontiers.","[{""submissionId"":20240001874,""id"":""993da4eae61045088015cd47317243b1"",""publicationDate"":""2024-02-22T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240001874,""endDate"":""2024-02-23T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""716432ba52af5ae28969871711580b23"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""The University of Texas at Arlington"",""location"":""Arlington, Texas, United States""}},""meetingId"":""573df8fe72a94ea5b31a21060e30906f"",""id"":""bde755faf6c54fc6baf1c62d09ea34ca""}],""name"":""Seminar Presentation at The University of Texas at Arlington"",""location"":""Arlington, TX"",""id"":""573df8fe72a94ea5b31a21060e30906f"",""startDate"":""2024-02-22T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""609524.07.02.03.02""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240001874
20240011945,CONFERENCE_PAPER,NASA's Human Research Program: Evolving Collaborations to Enable the Future of Human Spaceflight,"[""Jancy McPhee"",""David Baumann""]","Since its formation in 2007, the NASA Human Research Program’s (HRP) mission has been to protect the health and performance of astronauts as they explore beyond low Earth orbit. The HRP helps enable exploration spaceflight through a focused program of research that leads to the development and delivery of solutions to protect human health and performance during and after these missions. This research is conducted primarily in ground analogs of the spaceflight environment and on the International Space Station (ISS). Over the last 3 years, NASA has undergone transformative changes with the flight of Artemis I, the formation of the Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations Program, commercial flights to the ISS, and collaboration with new international partners participating in human spaceflight. The HRP has embraced these new opportunities and is collaborating on all these fronts to collect biomedical research data. Artemis I marked the arrival of NASA’s new human spaceflight exploration missions. NASA established the Moon to Mars Program Office to design a roadmap for the exploration of the lunar surface and the journey beyond to Mars. The HRP has a critical role in conducting research and delivering technologies that will lead to solutions that protect human health and performance, and is working closely with the Moon to Mars Office to ensure these deliverables are ready in time to support their strategy. The HRP is also developing the partnership strategies required to support these deliverables. Commercial space flights, both free flyer and suborbital missions and private astronaut missions to the ISS, are providing broader opportunities and more subjects to characterize spaceflight-induced changes to the human system and to test countermeasures. To better use these opportunities to achieve its mission, the HRP has been working to understand the commercial spaceflight companies’ needs and then partnering with them on aspects of mutual interest. In addition, the HRP continues to engage in long-standing relationships with its international partners through the International Space Life Sciences Working Group and other joint international groups. The HRP is interested in sharing its knowledge and collaborating on projects of mutual interest with new countries that are developing capabilities for human spaceflight. The next 10 years will shape how humanity partners on exploration missions to Mars, and the HRP is committed to enabling and developing collaborative strategies with commercial and international partners to keep humans safe and productive as they explore longer and further into space.","[{""submissionId"":20240011945,""publisher"":""International Astronautical Federation (IAF)"",""id"":""f1da84e2e5444b888a617bb7ab55c99d"",""publicationDate"":""2024-10-14T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""IT"",""submissionId"":20240011945,""endDate"":""2024-10-18T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""ab2f731624744ec49d4a31992566d6c2"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Astronautical Federation (IAF)"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""085a6ce59b78492586b2421056bc286b"",""id"":""13039c38bd094a7c80eaadf81fc59ba9""}],""name"":""75th International Astronautical Congress (IAC)"",""location"":""Milan"",""id"":""085a6ce59b78492586b2421056bc286b"",""url"":""https://www.iac2024.org/"",""startDate"":""2024-10-14T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""296511.01.04.10.01""]",undefined,"[""Astronautics (General)"",""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20240003127,""title"":""NASA's Human Research Program: Evolving Collaborations to Enable the Future of Human Spaceflight""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240011945

20250000411,POSTER,Behavioral Health Benefits of the ISS Pick-and-Eat Crop Growth System,"[""Lauren Landon"",""Sydney Begerowski"",""Sara Whiting"",""Cara Spencer"",""Suzanne Bell"",""Pete Roma"",""Gioia Massa""]","Summary: We summarize findings related to assessing the pick-and-eat salad-crop productivity and acceptability of the ISS food system as a countermeasure to maintain behavioral health in long-duration spaceflight.

BACKGROUND 
Plants are a potential countermeasure for the stresses of living in space. Caring for plants and eating fresh food have been shown to serve as a psychological benefit for previous astronauts and for others in analogous environments such as Antarctica [1,2]. Gardening can be therapeutic in terrestrial settings [3]. These effects may carry over or be more pronounced in austere environments such as spaceflight. It can reduce stress and increase sensory stimulation and enjoyment [2]. Growing crops may offer astronauts meaningful and engaging work as they care for living things in an austere environment away from Earth’s nature and as they provide sustenance for their crew. We examined the extent to which interacting with plants (e.g., tending to, consuming) was related to behavioral health outcomes in long-duration space missions.

METHOD 
Participants were 27 astronauts that interacted with the plant system VEG-04, VEG-05, and HRF-VEG (VEG-03 I-L, PH-04). In total, there were 106 in-flight observations. Participants completed monthly measures of mood and well-being, enjoyment and time spent performing specific crop growth and consuming the plants, meaningfulness, performance, connections with others and the Earth, desire to work with and eat plants, and experiences with struggling or dying plants. Higher ends of the 7-point Likert scale indicated more positive outcomes, lower ends of the scale were anchored with more negative outcomes, and the scale midpoints indicated neutral positions. Participants selected a specific survey version based on whether they interacted with the plant system(s) or not, and we included only the scores from the crewmembers that participated in any given activity.

RESULTS & DISCUSSION
Results indicated that participants generally rated tasks related to the plants and crop growth as enjoyable. Consuming the harvested plants and voluntary viewing were the most enjoyable activities. Tending to the plants was reported as moderately enjoyable, indicating BHP benefits from this work task. The BHP impacts of whether the task was engaging, meaningful, supported well-being, or was demanding for a crewmember were generally positive and increased over time. As shown in the Figure, working with plants was reported as more engaging, meaningful, and beneficial to well-being over time, while the demand from the task was moderate to low and consistent over time. Engaging, meaningful, and supporting well-being were strongly, positively correlated with each other, which is consistent with research that suggests engaging and meaningful work can support well-being. Plant activities such as voluntary viewing, watering, harvesting, and consuming, were positively related to task engagement and meaning, and enjoyment and well-being. Findings suggest that working with plants and consuming them can be a behavioral health countermeasure for long-duration spaceflight.

The result was a refined vision and mission, and revised goals, objectives, and strategies. One of the first changes implemented was to rename the directorate from Space Life Sciences to Human Health and Performance to better reflect our vision and mission. The most significant change in the directorate from 2007 to the present is the integration of the Human Research Program and Crew Health and Safety activities. Subsequently, the Human Health and Performance Directorate underwent a reorganization to achieve enhanced integration of research and development with operations to better support human spaceflight and International Space Station utilization. These changes also enable a more effective and efficient approach to human system risk mitigation. Since 2007, we have also made significant advances in external collaboration and implementation of new business models within the directorate and the Agency, and through two newly established virtual centers, the NASA Human Health and Performance Center and the Center of Excellence for Collaborative Innovation. Our 2012 Strategy builds upon these successes to address the Agency s increased emphasis on societal relevance and being a leader in research and development and innovative business and communications practices.

Subsequently, the Human Health and Performance Directorate underwent a reorganization to achieve enhanced integration of research and development with operations to better support human spaceflight and International Space Station utilization. These changes also enable a more effective and efficient approach to human system risk mitigation. Since 2007, we have also made significant advances in external collaboration and implementation of new business models within the directorate and the Agency, and through two newly established virtual centers, the NASA Human Health and Performance Center and the Center of Excellence for Collaborative Innovation. Our 2012 Strategy builds upon these successes to address the Agency's increased emphasis on societal relevance and being a leader in research and development and innovative business and communications practices. The 2012 Human Health and Performance Vision is to lead the world in human health and performance innovations for life in space and on Earth. Our mission is to enable optimization of human health and performance throughout all phases of spaceflight. All HH&P functions are ultimately aimed at achieving this mission. Our activities enable mission success, optimizing human health and productivity in space before, during, and after the actual spaceflight experience of our crews, and include support for ground-­‐ based functions. Many of our spaceflight innovations also provide solutions for terrestrial challenges, thereby enhancing life on Earth. Our strategic goals are aimed at leading human exploration and ISS utilization, leading human health and performance internationally, excelling in management and advancement of innovations in health and human system integration, and expanding relevance to life on Earth and creating enduring support and enthusiasm for space exploration.","[{""submissionId"":20140003544,""id"":""fb47c73479394759bfd9f175880dd91a"",""publicationDate"":""2012-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140003544

NASA-STD-3001, NASA Spaceflight Human-System Standard Volumes 1 and 2, establishes Agency technical requirements that enable human spaceflight missions by minimizing health risks, providing vehicle design parameters, and enabling the performance of flight and ground crew. Applicability and tailoring of these technical requirements are determined based on each program’s mission profile and procurement strategy.
The majority of NASA-STD-3001 Vols. 1 & 2 are performance technical requirements, meaning they state technical requirements in terms of desired results without stating a method for achieving it. All technical requirements contain a “shall” statement and can be followed by a short, italicized rationale statement. Rationales are intended to provide additional information for the implementation of the technical requirements. NASA-STD-3001 Standards are overarching and apply to all of NASA’s Spaceflight Programs. These technical requirements are essential pieces used to create program requirements that lead to successful designs and implementations.

The program has achieved this mission primarily through work in ground analogs and on the International Space Station. Over the last three years, NASA overall has seen transformative changes with the flight of Artemis I, formation of the Commercial LEO Destinations Program, commercial flights to the ISS, and new International Partners participating in human spaceflight. NASA’s HRP has embraced these new opportunities and is collaborating on all these fronts to collect biomedical research data. 

Artemis I marked the arrival of NASA’s new human spaceflight exploration missions. NASA has developed a Moon-to-Mars Architecture to map out how it will use the moon to de-risk and enable Mars missions. NASA’s HRP is a critical component to develop and deliver research and technologies for future Artemis Crew Health and Performance (CHP) Systems. The program is working closely with NASA’s Moon-to-Mars Office to ensure CHP deliverables are ready to demonstrate on the moon, as we also look toward Mars, and is developing the partnership strategies required to support these deliverables.

Commercial space flights, both free flyer and suborbital missions and private astronaut missions to the ISS, are providing broader opportunities and subjects to characterize the space-induced changes to the human system and to test countermeasures. To better use these opportunities to achieve its mission, HRP has been working to understand the commercial spaceflight companies’ needs and then partner with them on aspects of mutual interest.  

In addition, NASA HRP continues to engage in long-standing relationships with its international partners through the International Space Life Sciences Working Group (ISLSWG) and other joint international groups. The Program is now also interested in sharing its knowledge and ability to collaborate on projects of mutual interest with new countries developing capabilities for human spaceflight.

The next 10 years will shape how humanity partners on exploration missions to Mars. NASA’s HRP is committed to enabling and developing collaborative strategies with commercial and international partners to keep humans safe and productive as we explore longer and further into space.","[{""submissionId"":20240003127,""publisher"":""International Astronautical Federation (IAF)"",""id"":""dc48592f77394d28b652be6a34272c75"",""publicationDate"":""2024-10-14T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""IT"",""submissionId"":20240003127,""endDate"":""2024-10-18T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""ab2f731624744ec49d4a31992566d6c2"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Astronautical Federation (IAF)"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""ca2e7352daba4ad8883e830c0066b62d"",""id"":""cafee5991ece4c5faaabd0b19fa3ed59""}],""name"":""75th International Astronautical Congress (IAC)"",""location"":""Milan"",""id"":""ca2e7352daba4ad8883e830c0066b62d"",""url"":""https://www.iac2024.org/"",""startDate"":""2024-10-14T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""296511.01.04.10.01""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20240011945,""title"":""NASA's Human Research Program: Evolving Collaborations to Enable the Future of Human Spaceflight""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240003127

Deep space exposes crew members to multiple NASA-defined risks, including altered gravity, ionizing radiation, and social isolation. While the effects of individual stressors have been studied, there are still gaps in our understanding of their combined effects. In this study, we utilized the simulated five-ion galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and isolation to assess the combinatorial effects of space stressors on the central nervous system (CNS) in mice. Our study captures sexually dimorphic responses by quantifying CNS outcomes in crewage-matched male and female mice. We assessed CNS responses in mice exposed to four days of isolation, followed by three different dosage of acute radiation exposure (5 cGy, 15 cGy, and 50 cGy 5-ion GCRsim). Comprehensive hippocampal cytokine biomarker analyses were conducted in both males and females at two weeks post-irradiation (intermediate cohort) and 124 days post-irradiation (delayed cohort). Proteomics on hippocampal lysates were conducted in the delayed cohort. Our results provide evidence for sex-specific differentially regulated hippocampal cytokines and proteomic profiles.  Immunohistochemical analysis of the mice brain from intermediate and delayed cohorts is currently underway for multiple protein markers, including microglial activation, astrocytes, and dopaminergic neuronal population, among others.

20090042316,ABSTRACT,Spaceflight Human System Standards,"[""Holubec, Keith"",""Tillman, Barry"",""Connolly, Jan""]","NASA created a new approach for human system integration and human performance standards. NASA created two documents a standard and a reference handbook. The standard is titled NASA Space Flight Human-System Standard (SFHSS) and consists of two-volumes: Volume 1- Crew Health This volume covers standards needed to support astronaut health (medical care, nutrition, sleep, exercise, etc.) Volume 2 Human Factors, Habitability and Environmental Health This volume covers the standards for system design that will maintain astronaut performance (ie., environmental factors, design of facilities, layout of workstations, and lighting requirements). It includes classic human factors requirements. The new standards document is written in terms so that it is applicable to a broad range of present and future NASA systems. The document states that all new programs prepare system-specific requirements that will meet the general standards. For example, the new standard does not specify a design should accommodate specific percentiles of a defined population. Rather, NASA-STD-3001, Volume 2 states that all programs shall prepare program-specific requirements that define the user population and their size ranges. The design shall then accommodate the full size range of those users. The companion reference handbook, Human Integration Design Handbook (HIDH), was developed to capture the design consideration information from NASA-STD-3000, and adds spaceflight lessons learned, gaps in knowledge, example solutions, and suggests research to further mature specific disciplines. The HIDH serves two major purposes: HIDH is the reference document for writing human factors requirements for specific systems. HIDH contains design guidance information that helps insure that designers create systems which safely and effectively accommodate the capabilities and limitations of space flight crews.","[{""submissionId"":20090042316,""id"":""3999b28438464ebc844e6057ed943860"",""publicationDate"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20090042316,""endDate"":""2010-02-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigator''s Workshop"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""0e9cbe597ab64cc69228c3fbf339ab24"",""startDate"":""2010-02-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090042316

The document has been referenced in numerous design standards both within NASA and by organizations throughout the world. With research program and project results being realized, advances in technology and new information in a variety of topic areas now available, the time arrived to update this extensive suite of requirements and design information. During the past several years, a multi-NASA center effort has been underway to write the update to NASA-STD-3000 with standards and design guidance that would be applicable to all future human spaceflight programs. NASA-STD-3001 - Volumes 1 and 2 - and the Human Integration Design Handbook (HIDH) were created. Volume 1, Crew Health, establishes NASA s spaceflight crew health standards for the pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight phases of human spaceflight. Volume 2, Human Factors, Habitability and Environmental Health, focuses on the requirements of human-system integration and how the human crew interacts with other systems, and how the human and the system function together to accomplish the tasks for mission success. The HIDH is a compendium of human spaceflight history and knowledge, and provides useful background information and research findings. And as the HIDH is a stand-alone companion to the Standards, the maintenance of the document has been streamlined. This unique and flexible approach ensures that the content is current and addresses the fundamental advances of human performance and human capabilities and constraints research. Current work focuses on the development of new sections of Volume 2 and collecting updates to the HIDH. The new sections in development expand the scope of the standard and address mission operations and support operations.

Francisco""]","The human skeletal muscular and cardiovascular systems are adapted to the upright posture of Earth’s gravitational environment. Astronauts experience an altered gravity environment in spaceflight that leads to a number of physiological changes and decrements to these systems that can decrease overall crew performance. Countermeasures, including prescribed exercise during spaceflight, is vital for astronauts to maintain optimal health and performance. The degree of physiological deconditioning is dependent on a multitude of factors such as sex, age, mission duration, fitness level, and gravity environments experienced. Deconditioning begins immediately upon entering an altered gravity environment and physiological decrements of the skeletal muscular and cardiovascular systems are measurable among astronauts within a few days. Thus, to maintain their physical fitness, ability to perform mission duties, and be able to egress vehicles when needed, it is imperative that astronauts participate in exercise during all phases of flight. This is especially important for long duration flights where deconditioning effects can be more deleterious. The NASA Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer 3001 Standards Team develops requirements utilized by commercial and international partners to better understand spaceflight-induced physiological changes and countermeasures and expected outcomes with or without exercise.","[{""submissionId"":20250000273,""id"":""9ab8f1d202bb488a9d55d1d52721e2d3"",""publicationDate"":""2025-01-17T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""10449.4.01.01.02.1177""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250000273

Using the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) initiated by NASA’s Human Systems Risk Board (HSRB) [1], the team is surveying potential candidate models and novel strategies that generate metrics suitable for supporting decision making related to how the CHP system may influence human system performance risk. One such investigation includes classic Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) models.

Traditionally, HRA methods estimate the occurrence of human errors and their impact on the success of an activity when designing and operating a system. While humans perceive, interpret, decide on, and carry out a course of action, the factors affecting performance and error likelihood are commonly referred to as performance shaping factors (PSFs). 

Originally developed to alleviate safety concerns related to nuclear power plant operations, HRA methods such as THERP [2] and CREAM [3] dismantle an activity into tasks, requiring elemental steps to be executed, and assess their failure due to predefined PSFs. In this study, we compare generic HRA methods and those that incorporate some human spaceflight aspects, such as sleep conditions (SCREAM [4]), with respect to how they may be adopted to capture performance with an intention to mitigate detrimental outcomes elucidated by the HSRB DAGs. We suggest strategies to quantify astronaut performance specific to spaceflight activities and illustrate how such concepts may help in optimizing the CHP system capabilities with respect to Artemis missions.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240001176,""endDate"":""2024-02-16T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""82ea6adb78f04afc93013e605314f68e"",""id"":""458449eca08c4242a29472b6679615cc""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""82ea6adb78f04afc93013e605314f68e"",""url"":""https://www.nasa.gov/hrp-iws-2024/"",""startDate"":""2024-02-13T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""305041.01.02.10""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240001176

As the bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems, macrophages patrol every tissue in the body and show remarkable heterogeneity. Primarily, macrophages phagocytose harmful pathogens and release cytokines to regulate pro-inflammatory responses to infections and anti-inflammatory responses for wound healing. Prior research has demonstrated that spaceflight conditions, including microgravity and deep space radiation, have a detrimental effect on macrophage populations and functions. However, tissue-specific and individual spaceflight stressor-specific effects remain to be untangled. Furthermore, prior research into the effects of spaceflight on macrophages lacks experimental standardization, creating difficulty in reconciling disparate studies. Finally, due to their presence in various human tissues, easy accessibility in the bloodstream, and fast responses to immune status and spaceflight, macrophages present a unique opportunity for developing new diagnostic tools for spaceflight applications. Therefore, further targeted research on macrophage functions may
support astronaut health in long-duration crewed space missions, both within and beyond lowEarth orbit.

The BHP Operations team is active in areas such as selection, training, routine behavioral healthcare services, and work-rest schedule.  The BHP Laboratory is engaged in research in space and analog platforms to address the risks and other challenges associated with future deep space missions.  Their research focuses on topics that align with the NASA Human Research Program’s Human Factors Behavioral Performance Element goals. This panel will provide details of recent work by BHP Operations and the BHP Laboratory at NASA JSC, and will demonstrate their shared goals, and contributions toward, optimizing performance and maintaining the behavioral health and well-being of astronauts during all mission phases.In 2020-2021, NASA engaged another astronaut applicant screening process to identify its 23rd group of astronaut candidates.  The BHP Operations team completed a significant amount of work to evaluate applicants and provide valuable input to the Astronaut Selection Board and the Aerospace Medical Board.  One presentation will provide an overview of the work completed by BHP; and one presentation will discuss a critical competency important for successful job performance of the astronauts – Team Orientation.  The former will summarize aspects of BHP’s Select-in and Select-out process and provide lessons learned for future selection cycles; the latter will briefly discuss the competencies of BHP’s applicant screening work, with focus on the importance of Team Orientation and the challenges of its measure.  A third presentation will provide an overview of BHP’s current fatigue management work with astronauts and mission-critical operators at JSC (e.g., flight directors, pilots), and provide a look at the direction these fatigue management services may take in future exploration missions.   Two other presentations will focus on the research completed by the BHP Lab to measure in a standardized way the critical aspects of behavioral health and well-being.  One of the presentations will provide an overview of the Exploration Measures being collected during all space and analog missions, and the importance these objective measures have for future research and operations.

In previous studies, we identified miRNAs that are predicted to regulate rodent responses to spaceflight in low-Earth orbit. Here we have validated the expression of key spaceflight-associated miRNAs in rodents reacting to simulated spaceflight conditions (exposure to ionizing radiation combined with simulated microgravity) and in astronaut samples from the NASA Twin Study. We demonstrate that this circulating miRNA siganture is conserved between these different species and will serve as an ideal biomarker to monitor increase health risk due to exposure to the space environment.

The Standard Measures Cross-Cutting Project (SMCCP) collects and analyzes standard measures that support assessment and quantification of health risks and efficacy of countermeasures and technologies required to prevent or mitigate adverse outcomes from exposure to the spaceflight environment. 

SMCCP uses the following spaceflight analogs:
 - Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) in Houston, TX: 4-person isolation/confinement; nominal mission duration of 45 days; run by the Human Research Program (HRP). SMCCP uses weekly questionnaires to gather data on the crewmembers’ emotional and mental state and collects blood samples biweekly to measure crewmembers’ serum cortisol levels at the start, middle, and end of the mission. 
 - Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP) Ground-Based Experimental Complex, called NEK, in Moscow, Russia: 6-person isolation/confinement; duration of 8 months; run by IBMP. Standard measures data collected during NEK are the same as for HERA above. 
 - :envihab in Cologne, Germany: 12-person bed rest facility; closed environment; 30 to 60-day campaigns; run by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). For bedrest studies, SMCCP uses the international standard measures as documented in the International Academy of Astronautics publication titled Guidelines for Standardization of Bed Rest Studies in the Spaceflight Context (June 2014). These international standard measures evaluate potential changes in bone, muscle, cardiovascular, and visual systems, as well as changes in psychology and nutrition. The international standard measures complement those collected during studies by individual investigators and allow comparison of responses across different bed rest and countermeasures durations. 

In this presentation, we will review available SMCCP data collected during the recent isolation studies in HERA (C6) and NEK (SIRIUS-21), and during the SANS (SM1, SM2) bed rest studies in :envihab.

T."",""Globus, Ruth K."",""Crucian, Brian"",""Bhattacharya, Sharmila""]","Short-term and long-term spaceflight missions can cause immune system dysfunction in astronauts. Recent studies indicate elevated white blood cells (WBC) and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) in astronaut blood, along with unchanged or reduced lymphocyte counts, and reduced T cell function, during short-(days) and long-(months) term spaceflight. A high PMN to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can acts as a strong predictor of poor prognosis in cancer, and as a biomarker for subclinical inflammation in humans and chronic stress in mouse models, however, the NLR has not yet been identified as a predictor of astronaut health during spaceflight. For this, complete blood cell count data collected from astronauts and rodents that have flown for short- and long-term missions on board the International Space Station (ISS) was repurposed to determine the NLR pre-, in-, and post-flight. The results displayed that the NLR progressively increased during spaceflight in both human and mice, while a spike in the NLR was observed at post-flight landing, suggesting stress-induced factors may be involved. In addition, the ground-based chronic microgravity analog, hindlimb unloading in mice, indicated an increased NLR, along with induced myeloperoxidase expression, as measured by quantitative (q)PCR. The mechanism for increased NLR was further assessed in vitro using the NASA-developed rotating wall vessel (RWV) cell culture suspension system with human WBCs. The results indicated that simulated microgravity led to increased mature PMN counts, NLR profiles, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Collectively, these studies show that an increased NLR is observed in spaceflight missions, and in chronic microgravity-analog simulation in mice, and that this effect may be potentiated by the oxidative stress response in blood cells under microgravity conditions. Furthermore, these results suggest that a disrupted NLR profile in spaceflight may further disrupt immune homeostasis, potentially causing chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Thus, we propose that the health status of astronauts during short- and long-term space missions can be monitored by their NLR profile, in addition to utilizing this measurement as a tool for interventions and countermeasure development to restore homeostatic immunity.","[{""submissionId"":20190011699,""id"":""479525ec4161462da6e15ad19ae3ab9a"",""publicationDate"":""2018-10-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190011699,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""da54bd992eed42a7b5a1330791927b5f""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190011699,""endDate"":""2018-11-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""2cabff3c4be3424bb90ac97a5423c6a8"",""id"":""c4223b65ae8444a8a39444b64457b1ef""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""2cabff3c4be3424bb90ac97a5423c6a8"",""id"":""28f1bfac1bf947e28ab0c135dfd43421""}],""name"":""ASGSR 2018"",""location"":""Rockville, MD"",""id"":""2cabff3c4be3424bb90ac97a5423c6a8"",""startDate"":""2018-10-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C"",""NNA14AB82C"",""NNH15CO48B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190011699

Radiography (XR) has long been a cornerstone of terrestrial medical imaging, though it has not yet been used in the spaceflight environment. Medical systems for human spaceflight missions are constrained by mass, volume, and power, and until recently, XR systems have been considered too large and power-consuming for spaceflight diagnostic and therapeutic applications. However, the rise of commercial spaceflight and NASA’s refocused efforts on returning crews to the Moon for long-duration missions have introduced a higher degree of medical risk to human spaceflight and require a re-evaluation when optimizing medical system design. Over the last decade, XR devices have miniaturized while maintaining good diagnostic and therapeutic sensitivity and specificity, making new in-flight medical and non-medical XR applications a possibility. Initial research identified several medical conditions where
miniature XR would be beneficial for the diagnosis and/or management of medical conditions arising in space, though a more in-depth analysis is required to identify whether XR may add value to the management of such conditions. With this presentation, we aim to introduce the potential utility of miniature XR, review prior work highlighting where XR may be beneficial, and evaluate how miniature XR may reduce medical risk in human spaceflight missions.

<b>METHODS:</b>
IMPACT (Informing Mission Planning via Analysis of Complex Tradespaces) is a risk assessment tool developed by NASA to advance exploration mission medical system design by quantitatively estimating mission medical risk.
IMPACT v1.0 includes a novel evidence library baselined to exploration environments, an expanded list of 119 medical conditions, medical capabilities and resources critical for management of these medical conditions, and the ability for rapid and iterative analysis in the setting of modifiable design reference missions (DRMs). Our first analysis identified which of the 119 medical conditions XR had diagnostic or therapeutic utility for. Subject matter experts (SMEs) recorded which XR views would be performed under ideal terrestrial circumstances for diagnosis/management of each condition, as well as which views are pragmatic for spaceflight limitations. A second analysis utilized IMPACT to identify significant conditions that contribute greatest to medical risk during a notional long-duration Lunar orbit and Lunar surface DRM. Medical system risk estimates include loss of crew life (LOCL), need for return to definitive care (RTDC; medical evacuation), and an estimate of crew task time affected (TTA). Using a standardized semi-quantitative scoring methodology, a deeper evaluation of each of the most significant medical conditions was performed. Data from both of these separate analyses were used to hypothesize what ideal and pragmatic XR studies may impact clinical management of the most significant conditions predicted to lead to medical risk.

<b>RESULTS:</b>
Approximately 1/3 of the IMPACT conditions were identified as being more effectively or comprehensively assessed or treated with the addition of miniature XR technology. The resulting conditions benefitting diagnostically and therapeutically from XR are revealed, as well as the ideal and pragmatic XR views and medical procedures benefitting from XR. The conditions of clinical significance and those most contributing to risk are also displayed. Among the conditions that contribute greatest to LOCL, four conditions for which XR may improve the diagnosis and management of include: decompression sickness, traumatic shock, dental abscess, and respiratory failure. Among conditions that contributed to RTDC, the evaluation and management of wrist fracture is likely improved by XR. For conditions leading to crew TTA, evaluation and management of EVA shoulder injuries, upper and lower extremity
strains, back strains, and EVA hand injuries are likely improved by XR. 

<b>DISCUSSION:</b> 
Miniature XR in spaceflight has the potential to improve the evaluation and management of a substantial portion of conditions that most contribute to medical risk. This presentation is an introduction to the possibilities miniature XR provides for future human spaceflight missions and subsequent presenters will expand on potential applications in more detail.

<b>LEARNING OBJECTIVES:</b> 
1) Understand the previous limitations of using radiography in the management of spaceflight medical conditions; 2) Evaluate the findings from the IMPACT tool analysis, which allows quantification of the benefit miniature XR could provide for managing high-risk medical conditions in long-duration lunar orbit and surface missions, focusing on improvements in crew health outcomes; 3) Analyze case studies where miniature XR technology could reduce the medical risks associated with spaceflight missions, specifically in diagnosing and managing conditions such as decompression sickness, traumatic shock, and EVA-related injuries.","[{""submissionId"":20240012201,""publisher"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""id"":""70c15eaeb8b94fe5a443b7d0903a6094"",""publicationDate"":""2025-01-28T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240012201,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""239b373f53e642a58bb3fa9b7e784495"",""id"":""fe612e60e7a543ac89c562cbc88af8a7""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""239b373f53e642a58bb3fa9b7e784495"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]","[{""id"":20250000095,""title"":""Human Spaceflight Applications of Novel Miniature X-Ray Technologies""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240012201
20210021083,PRESENTATION,In-Space Manufacturing to Support Human Spaceflight,"[""Jessica E Koehne""]","As   human   spaceflight   pushes   beyond   Low   Earth   Orbit   (LEO),   resupply   of consumables becomes a significant challenge.  One solution to this problem is In-Space Manufacturing (ISM), the capability to perform on-demand manufacturing and repair of consumables in an in-space environment.   ISM offers significant flexibility to missions as it allows for a high degree of tailor ability and reduction in launch mass.   Leveraging advancements in fabrication, repair and recycling, ISM provides   a   highly   sustainable   and   affordable   solution   to   exploration   mission operations and logistics.  In this talk, advances in printed electronics and sensors, ranging   from   nanomaterial   ink   development   and   hands-free   fabrication methodologies to devices will be presented.   Applications presented will include sensors for crew health monitoring along with supporting electronics.  In the future, these devices will be fabricated and characterized on the International Space Station and the approach will be evaluated for future in-space manufacturing to support human spaceflight.

The safety hierarchy stresses that we are all accountable for assuring that our programs, projects, and operations do not impact safety or health for the public, astronauts and pilots, employees on the ground, and high-value equipment and property. When people are thinking about doing things safely, they re also thinking about doing things right. And for the past couple of years, we ve had some pretty good results. In the time since the failures of the Mars 98 missions that occurred in late 1999, every NASA spacecraft launch has met the success objectives, and every Space Shuttle mission has safely and successfully met all mission objectives. Now I can t say that NASA s safety program is solely responsible for these achievements, but, as we like to say, ""mission success starts with safety."" In the future, looking forward, we will continue to make spaceflight even safer. That is NASA s vision. That is NASA s duty to both those who will travel into space and the American people who will make the journey possible.","[{""submissionId"":20060021511,""id"":""c63942269b284f8bb4ef8b1180d7d631"",""publicationName"":""Looking Backward, Looking Forward: Forty Years of US Human Spaceflight Symposium"",""publicationDate"":""2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Transportation And Safety""]","[{""id"":20030004255,""title"":""Looking Backward, Looking Forward: Forty Years of US Human Spaceflight Symposium""},{""id"":20030004255,""title"":""Looking Backward, Looking Forward: Forty Years of US Human Spaceflight Symposium""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20060021511

The question is therefore: Are we ready to go? To answer this with a yes, we are currently using the International Space Station to develop an integrated human physiological countermeasure suite. The integrated countermeasure suite will most likely encounter: 1) Exercise devices for aerobic, dynamic and resistive exercise training; 2) sensory‐motor computer training programs and anti‐motion sickness medication for preparing EVAs and G‐transitions; 3) lower limb bracelets for preventing and/or treating the VIIP (vision impairment and intracranial pressure) syndrome; 4) nutritional components for maintenance of bone, muscle, the cardiovascular system and preventing oxidative stress and damage and immune deficiencies (e. g. omega‐3 fatty acids, PRO/K, anti‐oxidants and less salt and iron); 5) bisphosphonates for preventing bone degradation.; 6) lower body compression garment and oral salt and fluid loading for landing on a planetary surface to combat orthostatic intolerance; 7) laboratory analysis equipment for individualized monitoring of biomarkers in blood, urine and saliva for estimation of health status in; 8) advanced ultrasound techniques for monitoring bone and cardiovascular health; and 9) computer modeling programs for individual health status assessments of efficiency and subsequent adjustments of countermeasures. In particular for future missions into deep space, we are concerned with the synergistic effects of weightlessness, radiation, operational constraints and other spaceflight environmental factors. Therefore, increased collaboration between physiological, behavioral, radiation and space vehicle design disciplines are strongly warranted. Another venue we are exploring in NASA's Human Research Program is the usefulness of artificial gravity for mitigating the health risks of long duration weightlessness.","[{""submissionId"":20150003016,""id"":""a39b02256a3849c7beee55f7b0495521"",""publicationDate"":""2015-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150003016,""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Paris, France"",""id"":""d76f0e27e21c446a850a772834820b8b""},{""country"":""Czechoslovakia"",""submissionId"":20150003016,""endDate"":""2015-07-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""d614ffb8ebfb48b696956bf43f406c63"",""id"":""58fcae93e6f04e60ac91c9f00e124011""}],""name"":""Humans in Space Symposium"",""location"":""Prague"",""id"":""d614ffb8ebfb48b696956bf43f406c63"",""startDate"":""2015-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support"",""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20150011046,""title"":""Physiological Health Challenges for Human Missions to Mars""},{""id"":20150011046,""title"":""Physiological Health Challenges for Human Missions to Mars""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150003016
20220015709,TECHNICAL_PUBLICATION,Directed Acyclic Graphs: A Tool for Understanding the NASA Human Spaceflight System Risks - Human System Risk Board,"[""Erik L. Antonsen"",""Avalon Monti"",""Jacqueline Charvat"",""Erin S. Connell"",""Robert J. Reynolds"",""Ahmed Abukmail"",""Kristina Marotta"",""Charlotte Brown""]","For over a decade, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has tracked
and configuration-managed approximately 30 risks to astronaut health and performance that
occur before, during and after spaceflight. The Human System Risk Board (HSRB), a Health
and Medical Technical Authority (HMTA) Board at NASA Johnson Space Center, is the entity
responsible for identifying, assessing, analyzing, and monitoring the official understanding of the risk or risk posture for each of the Human System Risks and determining – based on evaluation
of the available evidence – when that risk posture changes. The ultimate purpose of tracking
and researching these risks is to find ways to reduce the risk that astronaut crews face during
spaceflight. Historically, research, development and operations relevant to one risk have been
conducted in isolation from other risks; these individual risk ‘silos’ enabled initial characterization
of each specific risk. In spaceflight however, the impact of exposure to risk for astronaut crews
is cumulative, and not independent of exposures or other risks, as all the adverse effects of the
spaceflight environment begin at launch, continue throughout the duration of the mission and in
some cases across the lifetime of the crews. In January of 2020, the HSRB at NASA embarked
on a pilot project designed to assess the potential value of causal diagramming as a tool to
facilitate understanding of these cumulative and interdependent effects as applied within Human
System Risk management. This process uses directed acyclic graphs as a means of formalizing
a shared mental model of the causal flow of risk among Risk Board stakeholders. Initially this
model was to improve communication among those stakeholders, but the potential value
exceeds communication alone. The causal diagrams are formulated as directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs) to function as a type of knowledge graph for reference for the board and its
stakeholders.

This document is a sister document to NASA/TM 20220006812 Directed Acyclic Graph
Guidance Documentation (1). In that document, the basic guidance for creating and
standardizing directed acyclic graphs as tools for cross-risk analysis is provided. This document
contains the initial configuration managed DAGs that were created as a result of applying those
principles. These initial versions were accepted by the HSRB in January of 2022. Each of the
Human System Risks are represented by a DAG that has been reviewed by the larger Human
Health and Performance community at NASA including life scientists, physical scientists,
physicians, nurses, pharmacists, exercise specialists and more. These results show the starting
point for Human System Risk DAGs as shared mental models and communication aids across
the boundaries of the various expertise needed to understand and mitigate the human risks in
spaceflight. Because they are a starting point, each of these DAGs can be expected to change
over time as new or refined evidence becomes available. The process for updating these DAGs
can be found in the JSC-66705 Human System Risk Management Plan (2) that is publicly
available on the NASA Technical Reports Server.","[{""submissionId"":20220015709,""id"":""44b533a7e48448bb85fe2a4a8e143777"",""publicationDate"":""2022-10-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""951219.06.05.10""]",undefined,"[""Documentation And Information Science"",""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]","[{""id"":20230001245,""title"":""Human System Risk Communication: Directed Acyclic Graphs""},{""id"":20205008887,""title"":""Human System Risk Management Plan""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220015709
20220014424,POSTER,"Neuro-Vestibular Examination During and Following Spaceflight (Vestibular Health)
","[""T R Macaulay"",""S J Wood"",""M F Reschke"",""Y De Dios"",""J P Dervay"",""T Makishima"",""M C Schubert "",""M Shelhamer"",""G R Clement""]","BACKGROUND 
Adaptation to microgravity during spaceflight causes neurological disturbances that are either directly or indirectly mediated by the vestibular system. These disturbances could include space motion sickness, spatial disorientation, and cognitive impairment, as well as changes in head-eye coordination, vestibulo-ocular reflexes, and control of posture and locomotion. Otolith-mediated reflex gains appear to adapt rapidly during spaceflight and after landing. However, animal studies have shown that structural modifications of the vestibular sensory apparatus develop during long-duration spaceflight. To date, no studies have characterized the severity of vestibular syndromes experienced by astronauts as a function of the duration of spaceflight or whether the effects are caused by changes at the peripheral end organs, midbrain, cerebellum, or vestibular cortex. 

OBJECTIVES
We will investigate temporal vestibular changes in crewmembers of short, 6-month, and one-year missions to identify trends in adaptation of vestibular health and performance in orbit and after landing. We will also determine whether the vestibular organs and/or the central vestibular system undergo structural changes during long-duration exposure to microgravity, which could cause vestibular disorders when transitioning to a different gravitational environment.

METHODS
Recordings of eye, head, and body movements, as well as subjective reports of perception of motion, will be used to determine the presence of abnormal eye movements, dysmetria, motion sickness symptoms, and illusions of motion during head or body movements. This includes characterization of temporal trends in central compensation for vestibular (otolith) asymmetry. Pre-flight data will be collected 90 days before the flight. In-flight tests will be performed early in the mission and once every one or two months thereafter. Post-flight examinations will be performed on the following days after return (R) from the mission: R+0, R+4, R+9, and R+30. Ground-based control tests will be performed on healthy volunteers in the laboratory to estimate mean normative responses.

CONTROL RESULTS
Thirty-two healthy (non-astronaut) control subjects performed the same ground test procedures as planned for crewmembers. In addition to establishing a normative database, these data were used to calculate vestibular asymmetries from perceptual reports during unilateral centrifugation, oculomotor responses during visual-alignment tasks, vestibulo-ocular reflex gain during head-impulse tests, and body rotation during stepping tests. A significant correlation was observed between asymmetries of subjective visual vertical and verbal report during unilateral centrifugation. Another significant correlation was observed between the asymmetries of ocular alignment, vestibulo-ocular reflex gain, and body rotation. These findings in a healthy cohort may help us better understand changes in vestibular asymmetries in crewmembers during and following spaceflight. 

RELEVANCE
If the observed symptoms in crewmembers are more deleterious after the year-long missions than those documented after 6-month missions, then relevant countermeasures will be required to maintain the health and operational performance of astronauts during longer missions. Depending on the etiology of the vestibular syndrome revealed by these tests, countermeasures will be proposed based on vestibular rehabilitation therapies currently used in patients with vestibular disorders, such as habituation, gaze stabilization, and/or balance training exercises.

Sanders""]","A key science goal of the NASA “Moon to Mars” campaign is to understand how biology responds to the Lunar, Martian, and deep space environments in order to advance fundamental knowledge, reduce risk, and support safe, productive human space missions. Through the powerful emerging computer science approaches of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), a paradigm shift has begun in biomedical science and engineered astronaut health systems, to enable Earth-independence and autonomy of mission operations. We present a decadal view of AI/ML architecture to support deep space mission goals, developed in concert with leaders in the field. We describe current AI/ML methods to support 1) fundamental biology, 2) in situ analytics, 3) high performance computing hardware, 4) automated science, 5) self-driving labs, 6) remote data management, 7) integrated real-time mission biomonitoring, and 8) a Precision Space Health system. Cutting-edge AI/ML approaches that can be integrated to support these domains include active learning, explainable AI, adaptive learning, causal inference, knowledge graphs, federated learning, transfer learning, and large language models. Finally, we present results from several current ML projects that are underway in the field to address key challenges of small sample n, high feature count, heterogeneity, and sparse data. These include 1) connecting omics data to phenotypic data using an ensemble model to infer causality of spaceflight rodent liver health disruption, 2) usage of explainable ML to interrogate the muscular underpinnings of spaceflight muscle atrophy, 3) ML models analyzing and determining directed acyclic graphs of human space health risk leveraging rodent bone datasets, 4) usage of large pre-trained models connecting biomedical knowledgebases with small spaceflight datasets to understand gene-to-gene interaction networks, and 5) a suite of benchmarked open science datasets (spaceflight mouse liver; radiation DNA damage) enabling programmers to identify the best ML algorithms to answer space biological science questions.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230015678,""endDate"":""2024-03-24T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""16e9adc4cde157588f427d84ee616885"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Brown University"",""location"":""Providence, Rhode Island, United States""}},""meetingId"":""518dddb6d2ec4e879d2b2f5aa336dc3d"",""id"":""bc7797e34a2442089d7845da511b1c85""}],""name"":""Industrialization of SciML"",""location"":""Providence, RI"",""id"":""518dddb6d2ec4e879d2b2f5aa336dc3d"",""url"":""https://icerm.brown.edu/events/htw-24-sciml/#"",""startDate"":""2024-03-23T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""},{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230015678,""endDate"":""2023-11-18T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9196578469af40089abd7559cd053c06"",""id"":""7a90357b8fa045b28c9ea945a2042775""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Washington D.C."",""id"":""9196578469af40089abd7559cd053c06"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2023-meeting/"",""startDate"":""2023-11-14T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.06.01.02.01.02"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine"",""Cybernetics, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics""]","[{""id"":20230009766,""title"":""Biological Research and Space Health Enabled by Machine Learning to Support Deep Space Missions""},{""id"":20230009766,""title"":""Biological Research and Space Health Enabled by Machine Learning to Support Deep Space Missions""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230015678

The focus of this study is to compare biomarkers previously identified as potentially relevant to both ocular and brain health against unique physiological outcomes of exposure to the space flight environment. Study subjects suffering from terrestrial conditions thought to be similar to Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS: formerly VIIP), e.g. patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and optic neuritis may be relevant to conditions associated with spaceflight. This study will review methodologies, tear biomarkers related to state of ocular and brain health, the strengths and weakness of using tear fluid biomarkers versus other body fluid samples, and will survey current tear fluid biomarker knowledge in research and clinical practice. A strength of using tear biomarkers is that sampling is non-invasive and used as a guide in understanding pathologies, including ocular and systemic inflammatory conditions (Cocho et al., 2016)., Salvisberg et al., 2014). Moreover, tear biomarkers may reflect diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS) (Salvisberg et al., 2014). For example, in multiple sclerosis (MS), the concordance rate between tear biomarkers versus cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is approximately 83%, indicating that, in the majority of cases, tears are at least as effective as CSF in potentially identifying novel MS biomarkers (Devos et al., 2001).","[{""submissionId"":20170005634,""id"":""da4e8b06f9544e398fb3d0b1cf6b6e01"",""publicationDate"":""2017-09-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Malta"",""submissionId"":20170005634,""endDate"":""2017-09-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""ee89a7169a014383bfb503ed63a9cdb8"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""European Association of Predictive, Preventive & Personalized Medicine (EPMA)"",""location"":""Bonn, Germany""}},""meetingId"":""eca397b2f11240aca6f7816e139de398"",""id"":""a00258ab698a47ebb07e1ccbe44deb1b""}],""name"":""European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) World Congress 2017"",""location"":""Valetta"",""id"":""eca397b2f11240aca6f7816e139de398"",""startDate"":""2017-09-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170005634

20230009066,ACCEPTED_MANUSCRIPT,"Exploring the Complexities of Drug Formulation Selection, Storage, and Shelf-Life for Exploration Spaceflight","[""Vernie R Daniels"",""Edward S Williams""]","Medications have been a part of space travel dating back as far as the Apollo missions. Currently, medical kits aboard the ISS contain medications and supplies to help crew members cope with a variety of possible medical events. NASA reported that 1,867 medical events occurred from 1981 to 1998 on space shuttle flights, STS-1 to STS-89; 498 out of the 508 crewmembers on those flights reported experiencing a medical event other than space motion sickness. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) convened a committee of experts, Committee on Creating a Vision for Space Medicine during Travel beyond Earth Orbit, to examine the issues surrounding astronaut health and safety for long duration space missions. The primary theme of the committee’s final report is that there is not enough known about the risks to human health during long-duration missions beyond Earth’s orbit and ways to effectively mitigate those risks in an environment of deep space. In 2014, the IOM convened the Committee on Ethics Principles and Guidelines for Health Standards for Long Duration and Exploration Spaceflights and released a report emphasizing the importance of prevention, mitigation, and treatment of major risks to human health during exploration spaceflight. NASA’s Human Research Program has organized five distinct categories of spaceflight hazards summarized by the acronym “RIDGE” (Space Radiation, Isolation and Confinement, Distance from Earth, Gravity fields, and Hostile/Closed Environments) that astronauts may encounter during exploration spaceflight. From those hazards, NASA further derived 30 of the most critical human health and performance risks, including limits to medical care resulting from pharmaceutical degradation. As we prepare for more distant exploration missions to Mars and beyond, risk management planning for astronaut healthcare should include the assembly of a medication formulary that is comprehensive enough to prevent or treat anticipated medical events, remains safe and chemically stable, and retains sufficient potency to last for the duration of the mission. The present editorial will summarize the current state of knowledge regarding innovative formulary optimization strategies, pharmaceutical stability assessment techniques, and storage and packaging solutions that could enhance drug safety and efficacy for future exploration spaceflight missions.","[{""submissionId"":20230009066,""issn"":""0306-5251"",""publisher"":""British Pharmacological Society"",""eissn"":""1365-2125"",""id"":""3e1da0bfdcd34365a5a60a4bb8fce5ae"",""publicationName"":""British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology"",""publicationDate"":""2023-11-08T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""issuePublicationDate"":""2023-11-08T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""doi"":""10.1111/bcp.15957""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230009066
20080029287,ABSTRACT,Space Life Sciences at NASA: Spaceflight Health Policy and Standards,"[""Davis, Jeffrey R."",""House, Nancy G.""]","In January 2005, the President proposed a new initiative, the Vision for Space Exploration. To accomplish the goals within the vision for space exploration, physicians and researchers at Johnson Space Center are establishing spaceflight health standards. These standards include fitness for duty criteria (FFD), permissible exposure limits (PELs), and permissible outcome limits (POLs). POLs delineate an acceptable maximum decrement or change in a physiological or behavioral parameter, as the result of exposure to the space environment. For example cardiovascular fitness for duty standards might be a measurable clinical parameter minimum that allows successful performance of all required duties. An example of a permissible exposure limit for radiation might be the quantifiable limit of exposure over a given length of time (e.g. life time radiation exposure). An example of a permissible outcome limit might be the length of microgravity exposure that would minimize bone loss. The purpose of spaceflight health standards is to promote operational and vehicle design requirements, aid in medical decision making during space missions, and guide the development of countermeasures. Standards will be based on scientific and clinical evidence including research findings, lessons learned from previous space missions, studies conducted in space analog environments, current standards of medical practices, risk management data, and expert recommendations. To focus the research community on the needs for exploration missions, NASA has developed the Bioastronautics Roadmap. The Bioastronautics Roadmap, NASA's approach to identification of risks to human space flight, revised baseline was released in February 2005. This document was reviewed by the Institute of Medicine in November 2004 and the final report was received in October 2005. The roadmap defines the most important research and operational needs that will be used to set policy, standards (define acceptable risk), and implement an overall Risk Management and Analysis process. Currently NASA is drafting spaceflight health standards for neurosensory alterations, space radiation exposure, behavioral health, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular fitness, immunological compromise, bone demineralization, and nutrition.","[{""submissionId"":20080029287,""id"":""3b521536aacc4f3891821e3cb3cb5669"",""publicationDate"":""2006-06-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Russia"",""submissionId"":20080029287,""endDate"":""2006-06-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""13th Conference on Space Biology and Aerospace Medicine"",""location"":""Moscow"",""id"":""39d81b4c3bab497aba75dfd2d30a08d0"",""startDate"":""2006-06-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080029287

A strategic view of the fidelity of hazards experienced on different platforms can shape the testing plans for human research and technology demonstration related to crew health and performance.

Working across the international partnership, the International Space Station (ISS) is planning periods of modified operations to improve the fidelity of Mars simulations.  To understand transit durations as an independent variable, a series of 1-year, 6-month and 30-45 day missions are being planned on ISS.  Standard measurements across ISS missions of different durations, lunar missions and ground analogs offers the opportunity to distinguish different hazards and their effects in the context of the relevance to future mission concepts.  The ISS partnership is planning for additional test cases that are aligned with Mars mission plans. (1) Evaluating crew performance capabilities when transitioning to gravity after long durations in microgravity representative of a Mars transit. (2) Simulating crew medical care under Mars-like autonomous operations.  (3) Identification and testing of operations under communications delay and autonomy expected for Mars missions and the linked effects on behavioral health and performance of the crew. 

Artemis missions serve as a valuable analogs for Mars surface operations, with partial gravity and deep space radiation hazards, but with crewmembers that are probably more physically capable than their counterparts would be after a Mars transit. Getting unobtrusive data from early Artemis missions, and knowledge gained from operational experience as Artemis operations develop can improve engineering design, medical requirements and countermeasures, and ultimately ensure mission success on Mars. 

Linking Mars architectures with the plans and capabilities for ISS and Artemis allows us to plan to most operationally relevant tests of crew health and performance on current spaceflight missions to inform planning for future missions to Mars.  By using human spaceflight platforms as well as ground simulation in an integrated way, the international community can improve exploration readiness, develop countermeasures and reduce risks of future human space missions.

We hypothesize that spaceflight stressors combine synergistically to trigger an oxidative stress response that, in turn, alters immune homeostasis, brain structure/function, and neurobehavioral/cognitive performance. Here, we report plasma and brain cytokine findings from two studies of crew age-matched (24-week-old) male and female mice exposed to simulated 5-Ion GCRsim at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). In Study 1, mice were exposed to 0, 5, 15, or 50cGy 5-ion GCRsim. Immune and brain measures were acquired either at ‘Acute’ (within 3 days post-irradiation; IR), ‘Intermediate’ (IR+14 days) or ‘Delayed’ (IR+125 days) timepoints. In Study 2, mice were exposed singly and in combination to 15cGy 5-ion GCRsim, simulated microgravity via continuous head-down tilt/hindlimb unloading (HU), and social isolation. Plasma and brain cytokine cytokine profiling revealed sex-specific as well as sex-common responses. Notably, plasma granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) levels showed significant regulation compared to a single stressor alone, suggesting a potential biomarker responder. Increased GCSF was correlated with corresponding increased blood neutrophil populations. Futhermore, our study provides evidence for robust effects of HU relative to IR alone. This project addresses NASA’s efforts to characterize risks in both women and men in anticipation of future space missions beyond low earth orbit (BLEO). Ensuring crew health and performance during extended transits to the moon and beyond necessitates that sensorimotor and cognitive abilities remain strong to avoid potentially catastrophic health and safety outcomes.

20240001381,PRESENTATION,2023 Artemis Crew Health and Performance (CHP) System Model Development,"[""Michael Krihak"",""Chris Laing"",""John Odina""]","While the NASA Human Research Program (HRP) utilizes a Crew Health and Performance (CHP) System to represent all the Agency’s efforts to ensure the health and performance of NASA astronauts, there is no shared mental model of a CHP system at NASA. Some groups may consider a CHP system to be only a medical kit, while others may not be using the concept at all. To facilitate the integration of functions and capabilities to ensure astronaut health and performance during vehicle development, HRP has proposed a CHP Shared Mental Model derived from the NASA Human Health, Medical, and Performance Spaceflight Standards (NASA-STD-3001 Vol.1/Vol.2). [1]

Even though many vehicle, ground, and communication systems as well as mission operations are modeled for the Artemis Campaigns, no mission level CHP system model was created to achieve the intent of the HRP CHP Shared Mental Model. The lack of this model renders it difficult to visualize and understand how the many programs work together to provide the necessary cross program functions and capabilities to ensure the health and performance of the crew throughout an Artemis mission. For this purpose, the Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) element of HRP developed a CHP system model for the Artemis III and IV missions to provide a view of how each program contributes to and interacts with the overall CHP system. 

To develop the 2023 Artemis CHP system model, ExMC leveraged existing data and models from the Moon to Mars Program Office, the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer (OCHMO) and the Orion, Gateway, Extravehicular Activity and Human Surface Mobility (EHP) and Human Landing System (HLS) programs. By using a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach, existing requirements, functions, and concepts of operations were combined to create a single system model focused on representing CHP from the launch to the return to Earth segments of the Artemis III and IV missions. Additionally, by incorporating the HRP Systems Platform for Aggregating and Relating Capabilities, or SPARC tool, the data from the programs was also related back to the 2nd volume of the NASA Human Health, Medical, and Performance Spaceflight Standard (NASA-STD-3001, Vol.2) and the human system risks identified by the Human System Risk Board (HSRB).

The first version of the 2023 Artemis CHP system model was baselined in Fall of 2023 after the model was demonstrated to be a potentially useful tool for systems engineers integrating CHP capabilities in vehicle development as well as members of the Health and Medical Technical Authority providing oversight of those programs. The model may also be useful to any stakeholder of astronaut health and performance by providing insights on how an Artemis mission satisfies the NASA Human Health, Medical, and Performance Spaceflight Standards as well as how they mitigate the HSRB Human System Risks. This presentation highlights how the model was developed and the possible benefits of the model.

These categories can be further broken down into specific subgroups generally associated with the CHP functionalities meant to mitigate or buy down individual human system risks. Taking a similar development approach we seek to leverage dynamic probabilistic risk assessment as a means to quantify and relatively assess the human risk state within the crew health and performance domain. By utilizing existing tools as integrators, we propose a rapid development strategy for incorporating research and operational data that represent the influence of the CHP system functionalities, in order to provide order of magnitudes estimates of the influence on most human system risks outcomes.

20240012137,ABSTRACT,Neuro-Vestibular Examination During and Following Spaceflight (Vestibular Health),"[""T R Macaulay"",""O Kuldavletova"",""P Denise  "",""S J Wood"",""M F Reschke"",""Y E De Dios"",""J P Dervay"",""T Makishima"",""M C Schubert"",""M Shelhamer"",""A Kheradmand"",""G R Clement""]","BACKGROUND 
Adaptation to microgravity during spaceflight causes neurological disturbances that are either directly or indirectly mediated by the vestibular system. These disturbances can include space motion sickness, spatial disorientation, and cognitive impairment, as well as changes in head-eye coordination, vestibulo-ocular reflexes, and control of posture and locomotion. Otolith-mediated reflex gains appear to adapt rapidly during spaceflight and after landing. However, animal studies have shown that structural modifications of the vestibular sensory apparatus develop during long-duration spaceflight. To date, no studies have characterized the severity of vestibular syndromes experienced by astronauts as a function of the duration of spaceflight or whether the effects are caused by changes at the peripheral end organs, midbrain, cerebellum, or vestibular cortex. 

OBJECTIVES
We are investigating temporal vestibular changes in crewmembers of short, 6-month, and one-year missions to identify trends in adaptation of vestibular health and performance in orbit and after landing. We are also differentiating between peripheral and central vestibular forms of vertigo and oculomotor disorders. 

METHODS
Recordings of eye, head, and body movements, as well as subjective reports of perception of motion, are being used to determine the presence of abnormal eye movements, dysmetria, motion sickness symptoms, and illusions of motion during head or body movements. This includes characterization of temporal trends in central compensation for vestibular (otolith) asymmetry. In-flight examinations are being performed early in the mission (Flight Days 1 and 30) and once every 2-3 months thereafter. Postflight examinations are performed after return (R) from the mission on R+0, R+4, R+9, and R+30. The inflight and postflight motion sickness questionnaires are customized to support data sharing across related studies. Ground-based control testing has been performed on healthy volunteers(18 females, 14 males;38.6 ± 9.2 years) in the laboratory to estimate mean normative responses, and on patients with bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP) (17 females, 13 males; 60.6 ± 13.0 years) at the University of Caen.  

RESULTS
As of September 2024, two crewmembers have completed all preflight, inflight, and postflight testing. Additional crewmembers are currently enrolled and data collection is currently ongoing. For ground testing, BVP patients performed similarly to previous postflight astronauts on R+0 in various walking performance tasks. Three additional body movement perception tasks have been tested. For the Triangle Completion Task, BVP patients had a larger mean angle of deviation and longer mean distance than healthy controls. For the Self-Rotation Task and Distance Perception Task, BVP patients had larger errors than healthy controls. These data suggest that vestibular deficiencies impact all aspects of body movement perception tested; whereas previous studies suggest that vestibular deficiencies are only associated with directional errors, not with overall trajectories/path lengths. These data will be compared to those of crewmembers during early postflight readaptation.  

RELEVANCE
If the observed symptoms in crewmembers are more deleterious after the year-long missions than those documented after 6-month missions, then relevant countermeasures will be required to maintain the health and operational performance of astronauts during longer missions. Depending on the etiology of the vestibular syndrome revealed by these tests, countermeasures will be proposed based on vestibular rehabilitation therapies currently used in patients with vestibular disorders, such as habituation, gaze stabilization, and/or balance training exercises.

As humanity prepares to extend its presence beyond Earth, an exploration food system that ensures the physical and psychological health and performance of the crews will be required. In 1964, the NASA Associate Administrator of the Office of Advanced Research and Technology, Raymond Bisplinghoff, stated, “We may develop boosters and guidance and control systems and reentry systems of exceptional efficiency, but unless we can at the same time sustain life in space we cannot have a manned space flight program”. This is arguably one of NASA’s first statements that focuses on food systems for astronauts. Experience with the current food system on the International Space Station (ISS) shows that some vitamins degrade and quality declines in the existing prepackaged food over multiple years of storage at 21°C. Additionally, the ISS prepackaged food system contains approximately 46% water. Based on current assumptions, logistics for a Mars mission requires a 5-year or longer shelf life and a significant mass reduction. The Human Research Program (HRP) has been evaluating methods to increase shelf life, which includes a resource impact in the need for cold storage, while the Mars Campaign Office (MCO) is seeking to reduce the water content of prepackaged food to 30%, which may result in a resource savings, but would require evaluation of impacts to variety, choice, and nutritional intake prior to implementation. In light of these issues, HRP and MCO are also investigating supplemental crop systems, which includes evaluation of crop growth within the challenges of spaceflight, resource requirements including mass, volume, power, crew time, cleaning and safety testing, and impacts to other resources, such as water, and how this trades with contributions to human health and performance. In support of these investigations, MCO is investing in the development of a supplemental crop production capability called Ohalo III. On board the ISS, Ohalo III may be used as a testbed for the development of crop growth systems and technologies, as well as implementation of a food safety program for pick-and-eat crops. Ohalo III may also be used to test candidate crops that meet spaceflight resource and safety requirements and provide continuous supplementation of astronaut nutrition, while validating the psychosocial benefits of having plants accompany astronauts on long duration exploration missions.

20210016831,CONFERENCE_PAPER,A Method for Validating Causal Diagrams of Human Health Risk in Space Flight,"[""Robert Reynolds"",""Ryan T Scott"",""Danielle Lopez"",""Lauren Sanders"",""Sylvain V Costes""]","The complexity of cause-and-effect relationships between spaceflight hazards and resulting health conditions clouds understanding of the totality of human system risk in space. In response, NASA has introduced Directed Acyclic Graphs (causal diagrams) into the human systems risk management process. These diagrams allow for a common understanding of the mechanisms that lead from unique hazards of spaceflight to the health outcomes important to agencies and astronauts. However, the paucity of available biomedical data from spaceflight creates a need for methods of validating causal models that can accommodate data from spaceflight model analogs. Here we outline one approach utilizing open-access rodent bone datasets from the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive. The properties of directed acyclic graphs themselves can provide an epistemological and statistical framework for validation of a priori causal representations of human system risk in space flight. The assumed causal connections on the graph creates sets of logical implications: variables that – if the causal diagram is correct – should be correlated, as well as sets that should be conditionally independent. By testing these implied correlations and conditional independencies both statistically and heuristically, we can provide evidence for or against specific causal pathways on the causal diagram. In addition to validation of expert-generated causal diagrams, machine learning techniques can learn the most likely structure of a causal diagram from a given dataset. Comparison with and reconciliation between machine-learned causal diagrams and expert-generated diagrams is another technique for challenging assumptions and improving our understanding of causal mechanisms.
Accurately representing complex causation is essential to systemic understanding of human health risks in space travel. Having a robust system of validating causal diagrams helps us arrive at more accurate representations of causal systems. This process will be integral to developing the countermeasures necessary for extended exploration of the moon and Mars.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20210016831,""endDate"":""2021-11-06T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9fbc487cc7e3456e9e252097aa1e20e0"",""id"":""9b706117e99a472d8e72a9f0681ba9ae""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research Conference"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""9fbc487cc7e3456e9e252097aa1e20e0"",""startDate"":""2021-11-03T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNX16AO69A""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210016831

The International Space Station provides an analog for evaluating techniques for dealing with Altered Gravity, the Radiation Environment of the ISS is only about 45% of the deep space values where radiation due to Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) dominate the spectrum. The Moon and cis-lunar space are being considered as a Mars Analog training ground for preparing crews for human mission to Mars. Spending more than 200 days in deep space is considered unsafe based on our current proxy for lifetime radiation dose. The paper outlines a way forward for spending days training near the Moon and for completing roundtrip missions to Mars while remaining below the current proxy. In the first case, a GCR overcoat shields crews from radiation during cis-lunar activities before making fast transits without in-space GCR overcoats to and from Mars. This case requires continued maturation of low TRL propulsion and power technologies currently around 4 to 5 while depending on repeatable reductions in launch costs by a factor of 6 expected of current reusable rockets. The second case requires no new technology development except for the expectation that the next near-term generation of reusable rockets will reduce launch costs by a factor of around 14.

Part of that challenge includes accurate risk communication, which is key to informed spaceflight operations. This is complicated by a number of myths that surround lunar dust health risks; false assumptions, half-truths, and generalizations that affect risk perceptions by the stakeholder community. Are silicosis and lung cancer legitimate concerns with future Artemis exposures? Is NASA basing its lunar dust exposure standard on very limited findings from Apollo? The NASA Human Health & Performance (HHP) Directorate has the responsibility for addressing these sorts of questions in accurately representing crew health risks associated with lunar dust exposure under Artemis. As part of that mission, this paper evaluates several of these myths, while sharing supporting risk assessment insights and technical findings that will hopefully provide a more balanced perspective on the lunar dust challenges we collectively face.","[{""submissionId"":20250000173,""publisher"":""International Conference on Environmental Systems"",""id"":""c8c8ce2e34934e8a914e95ebd1b29553"",""publicationDate"":""2025-07-13T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""CZ"",""submissionId"":20250000173,""endDate"":""2025-07-17T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""8a4c6bb4d92d4b57b245023ae13c7536"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Conference on Environmental Systems"",""location"":""Emmaus, Pennsylvania, United States""}},""meetingId"":""2230e830833b44fa9a3f495767c38d07"",""id"":""534e907525ed4df5ad1c4e52088803dd""}],""name"":""54th International Conference on Environmental Systems (ICES)"",""location"":""Prague"",""id"":""2230e830833b44fa9a3f495767c38d07"",""url"":""https://ices.space/"",""startDate"":""2025-07-13T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""954879.13.06.72""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250000173
20210024908,CONFERENCE_PAPER,NASA’s Identified Risks of Adverse Outcomes Due to Inadequate Human Systems Integration Architecture in Human Spaceflight,"[""Daniel M Buckland"",""Alonso Vera"",""Devan Petersen"",""Gordon Vos""]","The NASA Human System Risk Board (HSRB) has the overall responsibility for tracking the evolution of the top ~30 human system risks that it has identified to be associated with human spaceflight.  As part of this process, the Board is charged with maintaining a consistent, integrated process to mitigate those risks, and developing evidence-based risk posture recommendations. One of the identified risks is due to inadequate human systems integration architecture (HSIA) and a driving factor of this risk is that given decreasing real-time ground support for execution of complex operations during future exploration missions, there is a possibility of adverse performance outcomes including that crew are unable to adequately respond to unanticipated critical malfunctions or detect safety critical procedural errors. 
The HSRB uses Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as a communication tool for describing how astronaut exposure to spaceflight hazards leads to meaningful mission-level health and performance outcomes and as the basis for understanding intermediate causal relationships between risk contributing factors and countermeasures that link hazards to outcomes. The HSIA risk DAG will be presented and described.
Historically, critical malfunctions requiring Crew/MCC management occurred at a rate of 1.7 times per year for ISS averaged over the lifetime and 3-4 times per year in the burn in phase for the vehicle.  These averages do not include EVA data, which greatly increases the incident rate. Prior experience from the Apollo program showed 10/11 crewed missions experienced significant anomalies where crew relied heavily on MCC expertise in real-time.  These failure patterns are in line with those observed in other complex engineered systems (e.g., oil rigs, launch systems, commercial aviation, etc.)
It is likely that general malfunction and error rates are > 10% for short duration missions (<30 days), based on past and current spaceflight operations data. Likelihood of adverse outcomes has the potential to increase as crew conduct work with new, complex systems and with less ground support.
For Low Earth Orbit missions and Lunar missions less than 30 days, assuming minimal comm delays, disruptions and bandwidth limitations, malfunctions and errors can affect mission objectives and crew health but may be mitigated by ground support. For Lunar missions greater than 30 days and any potential Mars mission malfunctions and errors can have Loss of Crew and Loss of Mission consequences due to reduced ground support (communication delays, constraints and blackouts) for more complex operations, as well as reduced resupply and evacuation options.

20230014153,PRESENTATION,2023 Artemis Crew Health and Performance System Model Development,"[""M Krihak"",""C Laing"",""J Odina""]","While the NASA Human Research Program (HRP) utilizes a Crew Health and Performance (CHP) System to represent all the Agency’s efforts to ensure the health and performance of NASA astronauts, there is no shared mental model of a CHP system at NASA. Some groups may consider a CHP system to be only a medical kit, while others may not be using the concept at all. To facilitate the integration of functions and capabilities to ensure astronaut health and performance during vehicle development, HRP has proposed a CHP Shared Mental Model derived from the NASA Human Health, Medical, and Performance Spaceflight Standards (NASA-STD-3001 Vol.1/Vol.2). [1]

Even though many vehicle, ground, and communication systems as well as mission operations are modeled for the Artemis Campaigns, no mission level CHP system model was created to achieve the intent of the HRP CHP Shared Mental Model. The lack of this model renders it difficult to visualize and understand how the many programs work together to provide the necessary cross program functions and capabilities to ensure the health and performance of the crew throughout an Artemis mission. For this purpose, the Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) element of HRP developed a CHP system model for the Artemis III and IV missions to provide a view of how each program contributes to and interacts with the overall CHP system. 

To develop the 2023 Artemis CHP system model, ExMC leveraged existing data and models from the Moon to Mars Program Office, the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer (OCHMO) and the Orion, Gateway, Extravehicular Activity and Human Surface Mobility (EHP) and Human Landing System (HLS) programs. By using a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach, existing requirements, functions, and concepts of operations were combined to create a single system model focused on representing CHP from the launch to the return to Earth segments of the Artemis III and IV missions. Additionally, by incorporating the HRP Systems Platform for Aggregating and Relating Capabilities, or SPARC tool, the data from the programs was also related back to the 2nd volume of the NASA Human Health, Medical, and Performance Spaceflight Standard (NASA-STD-3001, Vol.2) and the human system risks identified by the Human System Risk Board (HSRB).

The first version of the 2023 Artemis CHP system model was baselined in Fall of 2023 after the model was demonstrated to be a potentially useful tool for systems engineers integrating CHP capabilities in vehicle development as well as members of the Health and Medical Technical Authority providing oversight of those programs. The model may also be useful to any stakeholder of astronaut health and performance by providing insights on how an Artemis mission satisfies the NASA Human Health, Medical, and Performance Spaceflight Standards as well as how they mitigate the HSRB Human System Risks. This presentation highlights how the model was developed and the possible benefits of the model.

20210023004,POSTER,Retrospectives: Current State of Knowledge on the Intersection of Spaceflight Stressors and Microbial Risks to Crew and Craft,"[""Jared T Broddrick""]","OVERVIEW
The spaceflight environment has several unique stressors that affect the health of both the crew and the spacecraft. An area of continued, albeit incomplete, study is the interaction of these stressors on microbial populations inherent to both astronauts and spacecraft surfaces and systems. A primary concern is the potential for the spaceflight environment to perturb the phenotype of these populations towards negative outcomes for crew and craft. In order to effectively mitigate these potential risks, they must first be characterized. We performed a retrospective literature analysis to assess the current state of knowledge regarding the affects of ionizing radiation and elevated CO2 on relevant microbial populations. The results of these retrospectives will guide next steps in the decisions of what (if any) further studies should be pursued and to guide decisions of the need for countermeasures.  

STRESSORS
Ionizing radiation. The health risk involved with increased exposure to cosmic radiation has been studied in crew for 35+ years, with human health and cancer risk being the main focus. However, space radiation could also affect both the resident microorganisms aboard the ISS and the normal, healthy astronaut microbiomes that are of direct concern for crew health. A retrospective review of over 250 publications was accomplished looking at the impact of cumulative ionizing radiation doses lower than 3 Gy (chronic or acute) on microbial populations. 

Elevated CO2. The health risk involved with elevated atmospheric CO2 in spacecraft, primarily focusing on human toxicological risks, is understudied. The current Spaceflight Maximum Allowance Concentration for 24-hour average CO2 is 0.4% (3 mm Hg), which is significantly higher than terrestrial levels (0.04%). Whether these elevated ambient CO2 levels aboard spacecraft influence the diversity and phenotypic responses of the resident microbial communities from both the spacecraft environment (air, surface, water) and crew members (gut, nasal, skin microbiomes) is not known.  A retrospective review was accomplished looking at the impact of chronic CO2 exposure up to 0.7% (5 mm Hg) for up to 6 months and acute exposure up to 2.6% (20 mm Hg) for up to 24 hours. 

CONCLUSIONS: MICROBIOME OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
The microbiome of the built spacecraft environment has been sampled consistently over the course of human spaceflight and significant advancements have been made in identifying microbial populations on the ISS. The dominant source of microbes on spacecraft surfaces are human-derived. Once in the spacecraft built environment, the extreme environment selects for features that enhance survival. While efforts to understand potential antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity of ISS isolates is robust, there is little to no understanding of which spaceflight environmental stressors, to include ionizing radiation or elevated CO2, drive the evolutionary trajectory of spacecraft-associated microbial populations.  

CONCLUSIONS: MICROBE-HOST INTERACTIONS
The host-microbiome field has emerged as an important factor in human health on Earth as well in spaceflight. The field is struggling with the complexity of the system under investigation as there is substantial taxonomic and functional heterogeneity in these communities, making it difficult to establish clear stimulus-response dynamics. Taxonomic characterization is the norm; however, the functional role of each community member is key to linking environmental perturbations to potential dysbiosis. For both ionizing radiation and elevated CO2, the likely target of the perturbation is the host tissue, not the microbes themselves.. Any resulting changes to the microbial community composition and/or function is likely a result of adapting to those changes in the host physiology. 

RECOMMENDATIONS
Emphasize functional characterization as opposed to taxonomic characterization of microbial communities.
Increase the number of investigations using chronic, spaceflight-relevant doses of ionizing radiation.
MoBE studies should move away from observational studies towards predictive modeling of community dynamics. 
Continue to develop scale-down models, such as tissues-on-a-chip & defined microbial communities. 
Focus on the crew response to elevated CO2 over MoBE considerations. 
Assess how direct contact with the hypercapnic environment affects skin microbiome dynamics.

20230009765,PRESENTATION,Biological Research and Space Health Enabled by Machine Learning to Support Deep Space Missions,"[""Ryan T. Scott"",""Lauren M. Sanders"",""Sylvain V. Costes""]","A key science goal of the NASA “Moon to Mars” campaign is to understand how biology responds to the Lunar, Martian, and deep space environments in order to advance fundamental knowledge, reduce risk, and support safe, productive human space missions. Through the powerful emerging computer science approaches of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), a paradigm shift has begun in biomedical science and engineered astronaut health systems, to enable Earth-independence and autonomy of mission operations. We present a decadal view of AI/ML architecture to support deep space mission goals, developed in concert with leaders in the field. We describe current AI/ML methods to support 1) fundamental biology, 2) in situ analytics, 3) high performance computing hardware, 4) automated science, 5) self-driving labs, 6) remote data management, 7) integrated real-time mission biomonitoring, and 8) a Precision Space Health system.

20140000234,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Future Challenges in Managing Human Health and Performance Risks for Space Flight,"[""Corbin, Barbara J."",""Barratt, Michael""]","The global economy forces many nations to consider their national investments and make difficult decisions regarding their investment in future exploration. To enable safe, reliable, and productive human space exploration, we must pool global resources to understand and mitigate human health & performance risks prior to embarking on human exploration of deep space destinations. Consensus on the largest risks to humans during exploration is required to develop an integrated approach to mitigating risks. International collaboration in human space flight research will focus research on characterizing the effects of spaceflight on humans and the development of countermeasures or systems. Sharing existing data internationally will facilitate high quality research and sufficient power to make sound recommendations. Efficient utilization of ISS and unique ground-based analog facilities allows greater progress. Finally, a means to share results of human research in time to influence decisions for follow-on research, system design, new countermeasures and medical practices should be developed. Although formidable barriers to overcome, International working groups are working to define the risks, establish international research opportunities, share data among partners, share flight hardware and unique analog facilities, and establish forums for timely exchange of results. Representatives from the ISS partnership research and medical communities developed a list of the top ten human health & performance risks and their impact on exploration missions. They also drafted a multilateral data sharing plan to establish guidelines and principles for sharing human spaceflight data. Other working groups are also developing methods to promote international research solicitations. Collaborative use of analog facilities and shared development of space flight research and medical hardware continues. Establishing a forum for exchange of results between researchers, aerospace physicians and program managers takes careful consideration of researcher concerns and decision maker needs. Active participation by researchers in the development of this forum is essential, and the benefit can be tremendous. The ability to rapidly respond to research results without compromising publication rights and intellectual property will facilitate timely reduction in human health and performance risks in support of international exploration missions.","[{""submissionId"":20140000234,""id"":""032021ececaa4a82b9649cc231a6affd"",""publicationDate"":""2013-07-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140000234,""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Paris, France"",""id"":""ae1a93b552634ddf964e6e9ed120518d""},{""country"":""Germany"",""submissionId"":20140000234,""endDate"":""2013-07-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""743fec1e663e489caf2d14788126e94f"",""id"":""6a779891da814115a07f5fa6f97d773d""}],""name"":""IAA Humans in Space Symposium"",""location"":""Cologne"",""id"":""743fec1e663e489caf2d14788126e94f"",""startDate"":""2013-07-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Transportation And Safety"",""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140000234

Douglas"",""Brian Crucian"",""Holly Dlouhy"",""Stephanie Krieger"",""Douglas Diak"",""Audrie Colorado"",""Satish Mehta"",""Sara E. Whiting"",""Hernan Lorenzi"",""Scott M. Smith"",""Millennia Young"",""Sara R. Zwart""]","Long-duration spaceflight impacts human physiology, including well documented immune system dysregulation. Diet, the microbiome, and immune system function are interlinked, but diet is the only one of these factors that we have the ability to easily, and significantly, alter on Earth or during flight. As we better understand dietary impacts on physiology, we may then improve the spaceflight diet to improve crew health and potentially reduce spaceflight-associated physiological decrements. Increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables and bioactive compounds (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, lycopene, flavonoids) and therefore enhancing overall nutritional intake from the nominal shelf-stable, fully-processed, space food system is expected to serve as a countermeasure to detrimental impacts to human physiology, including dysregulation in immunological profiles, the taxonomic profile of the gut microbiota, and nutritional status during spaceflight.

In this study, first we sought to determine the effect of the nominal shelf-stable spaceflight diet compared to an ""enhanced"" shelf-stable spaceflight diet on human biochemistry, immunology, and the microbiome in a ground-based, simulated space mission. The ground analog portion of this study was conducted in the NASA Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) Campaign 4 missions, which consisted of four 45-day missions with closed chamber confinement and realistic mission simulation to study effects on crew health and performance. As reported previously, analyses indicate beneficial associations between diet and markers of nutritional status, stress, the microbiome, and cognitive performance. Intake and beneficial associations varied by subject. This data will be used as a ground-based control for spaceflight, where the spaceflight environment (e.g., radiation, microgravity) will have additional impacts and the potential to evaluate effects of the diet will be greater.

The second phase of this study is to occur on the International Space Station, where it is currently being implemented. The test plan is similar to that used in the HERA missions. The enhanced diet is intended to provide 25% of the crews’ diet with foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, lycopene, and flavonoids, along with more fruits and vegetables in general (the other 75% of the diet will be obtained from standard and crew preference items available on the ISS). Biological samples (blood, urine, stool, and saliva) are being collected from participants at selected time points before, during, and after the mission. Data collection also includes dietary intake recording and body mass measurement.

Currently, 6 of 9 planned astronauts have completed data collection. Analysis of immune markers, latent herpes virus reactivation, the taxonomic and metatranscriptomic profile of the gut microbiome, and nutritional status biomarkers and biochemical metabolites will occur in batch to minimize sample handling variations. Mixed models statistical analyses will be used, incorporating random effects to account for repeated measures within individuals to assess the impact of diet on physiological outcomes.

We expect this study to provide evidence of beneficial impact of this enhanced diet on crew health and adaptation to spaceflight. These data will aid in evidence-based mass-risk trades for food system design and development of targeted dietary interventions for future exploration-class space missions.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220014360,""endDate"":""2023-02-09T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""62032a8349c641429aa144840fcd650e"",""id"":""207d6247d514493bbc725c10389a9510""}],""name"":""2023 Human Research Program (HRP) Investigator’s Workshop (IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX "",""id"":""62032a8349c641429aa144840fcd650e"",""url"":""https://www.cvent.com/c/abstracts/6c66b149-d763-4180-aed9-784f2773e5be"",""startDate"":""2023-02-07T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""012556.01.04.10""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220014360

20240005190,CONTRIBUTION_TO_LARGER_WORK,Risk of Bone Fracture due to Spaceflight-induced Changes to Bone,"[""Jean D. Sibonga"",""Elisabeth R. Spector"",""Greg Yardley"",""Joshua S. Alwood"",""Jerry Myers"",""Harlan J. Evans"",""Scott A. Smith"",""Lisa King ""]","The Human Research Program (HRP) is taking a biomechanical approach to assessing subsequent fracture risk in active astronauts as a consequence of spaceflight exposure. Triennial testing of active and retired astronauts continues as Space Medicine monitors for a premature diagnosis of primary osteoporosis, which is associated with age-related bone loss and skeletal fragility. 

This updated 2023 Fracture Evidence Report has expanded the description of skeletal changes to capture the full effects of spaceflight on bone:

• Recent analysis of fractures from health records of the full astronaut cohort, suggests an increased incidence rate of hip and spine fractures in astronauts following longer spaceflight duration flights compared to incident rates found in shorter duration flights.

• Routine preflight-to-postflight surveillance by DXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) does not provide the full detection of loss and recovery in the long-duration (LD) astronaut nor the full recovery of hip trabecular bone. 

• The inclusion of hip quantitative computed tomography (QCT) in flight studies delineates effects of spaceflight, of countermeasures, and of post-flight recovery on cortical and trabecular bone parameters—some of which are verified predictors of hip fracture in the aged.

• QCT detects and compares the distinct countermeasure effects of the pharmaceutical alendronate and of resistive exercise (on the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device, ARED) in specific cortical and trabecular bone sub-regions during spaceflight. 

• A published comparison of QCT-determined loss rates of hip trabecular bone in LD astronauts compared to terrestrial cohorts suggest that accelerated loss rates in trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD) during spaceflight might be analogous to skeletal effects of accelerated loss rates in females due to menopause, potentially leading to disruptions in trabecular microarchitecture.

• A dataset of finite element (FE) estimates of hip bone strength in aging terrestrial cohorts (spanning astronaut age-range) provides comparative context for changes in the FE of hip bone strength in LD astronauts, including comparison (force unit of newton) to percentiles (50th, 75th, and 100th) of sex-matched aged humans with hip fractures.

• Risk of fracture, due to the mechanical overloading of bones, is being updated with IMPACT, the next-generation tool suite for probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for exploration missions being created by the Exploration and Medical Capability Element (ExMC) at NASA. IMPACT is currently in development and will not be included in this 2024 update.

The risk for fracture necessitates understanding the relationship between applied loads to bone and the biomechanical competence of bone. The Risk for Early Onset Osteoporosis focuses on the weakened condition of bone (including development of new technologies, measurements of novel skeletal attributes, translation of multiple measures to an index of bone fragility, and interpretations of data used to reflect a weakened bone), while the Risk for Fracture assesses factors that influence the probability an astronaut would encounter applied loads exceeding the biomechanical competence of bones, resulting in fracture. This Evidence Report combines the research gaps and tasks associated with both risks.","[{""submissionId"":20240005190,""id"":""9aaebb514a204596be47d39f0e4ce979"",""publicationName"":""Human Research Program"",""publicationDate"":""2024-06-03T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""\t012556.01.04.10 HRP-HHC""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240005190

Astronaut explorers face unique challenges to their health while working and living with limited resources for rescue and medical care during space operation. At its core the practice of space toxicology to identify, assess and predict potential chemical contaminants and limit the astronaut s exposure to these environmental factors in order to protect crew health. Space toxicologists are also charged with setting safe exposure limits that will protect the astronaut against a multitude of chemical exposures, in a physiologically altered state. In order to maintain sustained occupation in space, toxicological risks are gauged and managed within the context of isolation, continual exposures, reuse of air and water, limited rescue options, and the necessary use of highly toxic compounds required for propulsion. As the space program move towards human presence and exploration other celestial bodies in situ toxicological risks, such as inhalation of unusual and/or reactive mineral dusts must also be analyzed and controlled. Placing humans for long-term presence in space creates several problems and challenges to the long-term health of the crew, such as bone-loss and immunological challenges and has spurred research into acute, chronic and episodic exposure of the pulmonary system to mineral dusts [2]. NASA has demonstrated that lunar soil contains several types of reactive dusts, including an extremely fine respirable component. In order to protect astronaut health, NASA is now investigating the toxicity of this unique class of dusts. Understanding how these reactive components behave ""biochemically"" in a moisture-rich pulmonary environment will aid in determining how toxic these particles are to humans. The data obtained from toxicological examination of lunar dusts will determine the human risk criteria for lunar dust exposure and produce a lunar health standard.","[{""submissionId"":20090011034,""id"":""a981b27546ec44659f6847909343d416"",""publicationDate"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Italy"",""submissionId"":20090011034,""endDate"":""2009-10-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Sixth Interdisciplinary Transport Phenomena"",""location"":""Volterrs"",""id"":""fbedcce83cf64548aa87f8926494f0b3"",""startDate"":""2009-10-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090011034

The inaugural generation of the NASA Behavioral Health & Performance (BHP) Standard Measures includes a neurocognitive test battery, actigraphy, physical proximity sensors, cardiovascular monitors, and subjective self-reports of mood, depression, and various team and social processes and performance outcomes.","[{""submissionId"":20190000670,""id"":""e298f91e02ab421981eae941a470d70d"",""publicationDate"":""2018-05-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190000670,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States"",""id"":""3564c9ec7aa94a1fb9825740f241af1e""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190000670,""endDate"":""2018-05-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""de36df70d4074cdeb387415cdcd36d5a"",""id"":""bf14303c3a2c43b5bf01821de2ff58d7""}],""name"":""Annual Scientific Meeting of the Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA)"",""location"":""Dallas, TX"",""id"":""de36df70d4074cdeb387415cdcd36d5a"",""startDate"":""2018-05-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190000670
20240012115,PREPRINT,Expanding Ketamine Application for Treatment of Acute Suicidality in Long-Duration Spaceflight,"[""Craig J Kutz"",""Amit M Mistry"",""Charles H Dukes""]","Introduction. The transition to exploration missions places a heightened risk on behavioral health in spaceflight. Although serious psychiatric emergencies during spaceflight have been rare, longer duration missions increase the possibility of emergence in latent mental health disorders due to genetic predisposition, increased autonomy, isolation, helplessness, loss of family member, or catastrophic events. Complicated grief and bereavement have the highest rate of suicidal ideation.  Recently, ketamine has been used as an emergent intervention for acute suicidality, promoting its stability, ease of administration, favorable safety profile, and outcomes for reduction of suicidal intent. The goal of this study was to review current literature and collate the understanding of ketamine as a safe, effective pharmacological adjunct for acute suicidality in spaceflight. 

Methods. This literature review was conducted to collate data on ketamine use for acute suicidality and inform on stability, limitations and utilization of ketamine within extreme environments.

Results. 122 publications were reviewed for relevance including 23 randomized-control trials for ketamine use in behavioral emergencies.  

Discussion. Ketamine is a diverse pharmaceutical with multiple advantageous indications, including acute suicidality, pain, and sedation. Terrestrial use of ketamine suggests a rapidly efficacious medication for reduction in acute suicidality.  As behavioral stressors expand related to extended missions, contingencies for behavioral emergencies become increasingly important. Although this review is not intended to re-develop current International Space Station (ISS) protocols, it is the first to discuss the benefits of ketamine in spaceflight as a potential safe, effective multifaceted tool for future exploration missions and treatment for acute suicidal ideation.","[{""submissionId"":20240012115,""publisher"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""id"":""34d3b0b485f84cadbde1e30af732493c"",""publicationName"":""Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance"",""publicationDate"":""2024-10-25T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240012115

Identifying and developing effective and efficient countermeasure strategies are necessary to maintain crew health and performance. Previous studies (VEG-04A and VEG-04B) in the Veggie vegetable-production system on the International Space Station have evaluated the behavioral health effects of caring for plants as a potential countermeasure for crew stresses in spaceflight. The presence of plants can augment sensory stimulation (visual, tactile, and olfactory), provide a psychological link to Earth, reduce stress, and increase happiness. However, further research is needed to understand this strategy for longer-duration missions in isolated, confined, extreme (ICE) environments. The Neumayer III Station in Antarctica is one such environment that hosts a small crew for fourteen-month missions, of which eight to nine months are the remote overwintering phase. Neumayer III also features EDEN ISS, a greenhouse facility with 12.5 m2 plant cultivation space that, like Veggie, currently supplements the crew diet with a variety of fresh produce. Up to nine crew members of the 2021 overwintering mission will complete behavioral health surveys that are designed to capture enjoyment and time spent conducting various plant-related activities, sensory stimulation, and active and passive psychological effects of having live plants and available fresh food in an ICE environment. Data will be collected once pre-mission, up to ten times in-mission at monthly increments, and once post-mission. This study aims to quantify the impact of plant care as a countermeasure strategy for human spaceflight and Antarctic exploration missions.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20205008582,""endDate"":""2021-02-04T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Workshop""}},""meetingId"":""3dd3cbe3ac23411ebb0c0c7e3aceb2cd"",""id"":""63a6bd60fa764b139bf8bd070bf82699""}],""name"":"" 2021 NASA Human Research Program Innovators’ Workshop "",""location"":""Virtual "",""id"":""3dd3cbe3ac23411ebb0c0c7e3aceb2cd"",""startDate"":""2021-02-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""80KSC017C0012"",""80NSSC17K0644""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205008582

Through artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), a paradigm shift has begun in space biosciences and engineered astronaut health systems, to enable Earth-independence and mission operations autonomy. We describe current AI/ML methods to support 1) fundamental biology, 2) in situ analytics, 3) high performance computing, 4) automated science, 5) self-driving labs, 6) remote data management, 7) integrated mission biomonitoring, and 8) a Precision Space Health system. AI/ML approaches that can be integrated to support these domains include active learning, explainable AI, adaptive learning, causal inference, knowledge graphs, federated learning, transfer learning, and large language models. Finally, we present results from several current ML projects that are underway in the space biology field to address key challenges of small sample n, high feature count, heterogeneity, and sparse data. These include 1) connecting omics to phenotypic data using an ensemble model to infer causality of rodent liver health disruption, 2) usage of explainable ML to interrogate muscular underpinnings of muscle atrophy, 3) ML models analyzing and determining directed acyclic graphs of human health risk leveraging rodent bone datasets, 4) usage of large pre-trained models connecting biomedical knowledgebases with small spaceflight datasets to understand gene-to-gene interactions, and 5) a suite of benchmarked open science datasets enabling programmers to identify best algorithms to answer space biology questions.",[],"[{""country"":""CA"",""submissionId"":20230009766,""endDate"":""2023-08-25T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""efcb1665f0725c91a6c715d407281a47"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""University of Toronto"",""location"":""Toronto, Ontario, Canada""}},""meetingId"":""b9bb52e91a7543c488c7ec2900879341"",""id"":""e491a2f40b6c40f8aadba5c90c016f9f""}],""name"":""Accelerate Conference"",""location"":""Toronto"",""id"":""b9bb52e91a7543c488c7ec2900879341"",""url"":""https://www.accelerate23.ca/"",""startDate"":""2023-08-22T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.06.01.02.01.02""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine"",""Cybernetics, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics""]","[{""id"":20230015678,""title"":""Biological Research and Space Health Enabled by Machine Learning to Support Deep Space Missions""},{""id"":20230015678,""title"":""Biological Research and Space Health Enabled by Machine Learning to Support Deep Space Missions""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230009766

""]","Spaceflight impacts human physiology, including well documented immune system dysregulation. Diet, immune function, and the microbiome are interlinked, but diet is the only one of these factors that we have the ability to easily, and significantly, alter on Earth or during flight. As we understand dietary impacts on physiology more thoroughly, we may then improve the spaceflight diet to improve crew health and potentially reduce flight-associated physiological alterations. It is expected that increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables and bioactive compounds (e.g.,omega-3 fatty acids, lycopene, flavonoids) and therefore enhancing overall nutritional intake from the nominal shelf-stable, fully-processed space food system could serve as a countermeasure to improve human immunological profiles, the taxonomic profile of the gut microbiota, and nutritional status, especially where currently dysregulated during spaceflight. This interdisciplinary study will determine the effect of the current shelf-stable spaceflight diet compared to an ""enhanced"" shelf-stable spaceflight diet (25% more foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, lycopene, flavonoids, fruits, and vegetables). The NASA Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) 2017 missions, consisting of closed chamber confinement, realistic mission simulation, in a high-fidelity mock space vehicle, will serve as a platform to replicate mission stressors and the dysregulated physiology observed in astronauts. Biosampling of crew members will occur at selected intervals, with complete dietary tracking. Outcome measures will include immune markers (e.g., peripheral leukocyte distribution, inflammatory cytokine profiles, T cell function), the taxonomic and metatranscriptomic profile of the gut microbiome, and nutritional status biomarkers and metabolites. Data collection will also include complete dietary tracking. Statistical evaluations will determine physiological and biochemical shifts in relation to nutrient in take and study phase. Beneficial improvements will provide evidence of the impact of diet on crew health and adaptation to this spaceflight analog, and will aid in the design and development of more-efficient targeted dietary interventions.","[{""submissionId"":20170000370,""id"":""5e9c9bde49234ad480e9bf6a349f1af3"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170000370,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""039021b297624b70a5bd588121724e56"",""id"":""83485b18e43448c3b040db0446d172d3""}],""name"":""NASA HRP Investigator''s Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""039021b297624b70a5bd588121724e56"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170000370

Broyan, Jr."",""Andrew Abercromby"",""Alexander Burg""]","Human spaceflight is a complex endeavor requiring multiple capabilities for transportation, crew health, scientific goals, and safe return to Earth.  The difference between spaceflight proven capabilities and those needed for future exploration architectures is defined as a capability gap.  Capability gaps are not technology specific.  Each capability gap may be closed with a wide array of technologies that have unique benefits and challenges.  Determining what a capability’s relevant and distinguishing key performance parameters (KPPs) are for a mission is critical.  Mass, power, and volume are always constrained and important, but defining these in a way normalized by performance is very important.  KPP definition for reliability, dormancy, and integration needs are hard to define but critical. Outside of technical considerations, the programmatic factors of the estimated time to develop the technology and how the technology validation objectives are matured are strong considerations in which technologies should be pursued and how they should leverage earlier mission elements.  The Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLSS) and Crew Health and Performance (CHP) capability areas are decomposed to high level gaps. While KPPs should  be technology agnostic, they can be used to both compare technologies and measure progress of technology development over time.  KPPs help define when the gap is closed, and the core mission objectives can be accomplished.  Proposed technology improvements to enhance a capability should balance improved KPPs and against investments in other capabilities that are not yet closed.  A selection of gaps, KPPs, and validation objectives and their formulation, current state, and how they inform capability roadmap planning are discussed.

The research activities of the Human Research Program (HRP) provide substantial evidence to support most risk reduction work. The Human System Risk Board (HSRB), acting on behalf of the Office of Chief Health and Medical Officer (OCHMO), assesses these risks and assigns likelihood and consequence ratings to track progress. Unfortunately, many traditional approaches in risk assessment such as those used in the engineering aspects of spaceflight are difficult to apply to human system risks. This presentation discusses the unique aspects of risk assessment from the human system risk perspective and how these limitations are accommodated and addressed in order to ensure that reasonable inputs are provided to support the OCHMO's overall risk posture for manned exploration missions.","[{""submissionId"":20150021492,""id"":""9f5fdbd034fe4219b605aae6d3b7bbd9"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150021492,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""5e263e09d52345b492a05638c1dcf696"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst.

High-fidelity ground-based and space-based simulations of hazards induced by these missions can be used to conduct research that will help mitigate potential adverse outcomes in behavioral health and performance. In this review, current classifications of NASA’s research analogs are discussed, along with their strengths and limitations for effectively assessing risk to Moon- and Mars-bound astronauts’ behavioral health and performance.

20170008859,ABSTRACT,"The Integrated Impact of Diet on Human Immune Response, the Gut Microbiota, and Nutritional Status During Adaptation to a Spaceflight Analog","[""Douglas, G. L."",""Zwart, S. R."",""Young, M."",""Kloeris, V."",""Crucian, B."",""Smith, S. M."",""Lorenzi, H.""]","Spaceflight impacts human physiology, including well documented immune system dysregulation. Diet, immune function, and the microbiome are interlinked, but diet is the only one of these factors that we have the ability to easily, and significantly, alter on Earth or during flight. As we understand dietary impacts on physiology more thoroughly, we may then improve the spaceflight diet to improve crew health and potentially reduce spaceflight-associated physiological alterations. It is expected that increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables and bioactive compounds (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, lycopene, flavonoids) and therefore enhancing overall nutritional intake from the nominal shelf-stable, fully-processed space food system could serve as a countermeasure to improve human immunological profiles, the taxonomic profile of the gut microbiota, and nutritional status, especially where currently dysregulated during spaceflight. This interdisciplinary study will determine the effect of the current shelf-stable spaceflight diet compared to an ""enhanced"" shelf-stable spaceflight diet (25% more foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, lycopene, flavonoids, and more fruits, and vegetables in general). The NASA Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) 2017 missions, consisting of four 45-day missions with closed chamber confinement and realistic mission simulation in a high-fidelity mock space vehicle, will serve as a platform to replicate mission stressors and the effects on crew biochemistry, immunology, and the gut microbiome. Bio sampling of crewmembers is scheduled for selected intervals pre- and in-mission. Data collection also includes dietary intake recording. Outcome measures will include immune markers (e.g., peripheral leukocyte distribution, inflammatory cytokine profiles, T cell function), the taxonomic and metatranscriptomic profile of the gut microbiome, and nutritional status biomarkers and metabolites. Statistical evaluations will determine physiological and biochemical shifts in relation to nutrient intake and study phase. To date, sample collection has been completed for 2 crewmembers from the first mission, aka Campaign 4 Mission 1. Mission 2 was terminated after 22 days due to effects of Hurricane Harvey, and sample collection was not completed. Sample collection will continue for Campaign 4 Mission 3 and 4 prior to comprehensive sample analysis. Beneficial improvements will provide evidence of the impact of diet on crew health and adaptation to this spaceflight analog, and will aid in the design and development of more-efficient targeted dietary interventions for exploration missions.","[{""submissionId"":20170008859,""id"":""3b17bc8da46f4a7aa743daca54f5c892"",""publicationDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170008859,""endDate"":""2018-01-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""910cb54c0f6d4afe85abbc5f05e087c3"",""id"":""8390f3f131ae4e6780256f6a0bd47d03""}],""name"":""2018 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""910cb54c0f6d4afe85abbc5f05e087c3"",""startDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170008859
20250000226,PRESENTATION,Long-Term Health Risk Quantification ,"[""Beth Lewandowski"",""Chris Gallo"",""Matt Prelich"",""Hunter Rehm"",""Suleyman Gokoglu"",""Lauren McIntyre"",""Jerry Myers"",""Ruth Reitzel"",""Mary Van Baalen""]","Astronauts face hazards during spaceflight, including space radiation exposure, isolation and confinement, traveling far distances from Earth, reduced gravity levels, and closed and hostile environments. These hazards drive the definition of human health and performance risks associated with spaceflight. NASA’s Human System Risk Board maintains the human spaceflight risk posture for in-mission risks, as well as post-flight, Long-Term Health (LTH)risks potentially occurring later in the astronaut’s life. LTH risk encompasses the timeframe from immediately post-flight, through the rest of an astronaut’s career, through retirement, and until death. Possible LTH risk outcomes include the time and interventions needed for the astronaut to return to preflight physiological states after experiencing spaceflight hazards and recovery from any in-mission medical events that persist into the post-flight timeframe. It includes chronic complications that may arise due to experiencing in-flight medical conditions or injuries and medical conditions that occur later in life with a higher probability of occurrence or with more severity because of their spaceflight exposure. Finally, LTH risk outcomes can also include a reduction in life expectancy due to spaceflight exposures.  

There have been 144 medical conditions identified by NASA’s Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health team to be associated with LTH risk. Epidemiological studies have been performed for some of these conditions to determine if astronauts suffer from an increased prevalence or severity of the condition due to their spaceflight experience compared to a comparable cohort  .Differences in astronaut mortality or morbidity due to spaceflight experience were not detected in several of these studies. There were two cases where a modest increase in the incidence rate of astronaut LTH outcomes was detected. The first suggested an increase in the incidence of melanoma cases in astronauts, where the number of cases in astronauts were similar to the elevated number of cases observed in airplane pilots. The second provided some evidence of elevated numbers of cardiovascular disease events in astronauts compared to an appropriate healthy comparator cohort, which may warrant additional investigation. 

The lack of detection of LTH risk outcomes should not ease concerns about astronaut LTH. The studies highlighted here constitute only a small portion of the potential LTH conditions that could occur. Once epidemiological studies are performed on all conditions, significant findings may be detected. The analysis of astronaut LTH also suffers from limited numbers of data points because of the limited numbers of astronauts overall and the even fewer who have reached an age where LTH outcomes may begin to manifest. As shuttle and ISS astronauts begin to age and increase the feasibility of analysis, LTH outcomes may be detected. 

An application of risk quantification is the use of risk metrics within trade studies for resource prioritization and decision making. Trade studies regarding countermeasures to LTH risk outcomes would benefit from a quantification of LTH risk.  NASA has ground-based processes in place such as astronaut screening and access to continuous medical monitoring and care during and after their astronaut career which are the main methods for mitigating LTH risk. In-mission countermeasures, such as acceptable levels of medical care and available countermeasures to counter spaceflight related physiological decrements, can mitigate a poor health and performance status immediately post-flight. Identifying appropriate risk metrics, obtaining valid quantities for them, and tying them to LTH countermeasures are necessary steps for realizing their use in trade studies. This presentation will highlight the challenges associated with the identification, quantification, and utilization of LTH risk metrics",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20250000226,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""adeb3afdb0474ba08e4d59624a3cef91"",""id"":""533b3fffdbd64cac97633da7f637795a""}],""name"":""2025 Human Research Program Investigators' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""adeb3afdb0474ba08e4d59624a3cef91"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""305041""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250000226
20190030357,PRESENTATION,Systemic Alterations with Spaceflight Associated Health Risks Originating from Both Circulating miRNAs and Mitochondrial Biology,"[""Beheshti, Afshin""]","The many known health risks currently associated with space travel include increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, central nervous system related diseases, muscle degeneration, and changes with host-gut microbiome interactions that can have profound impact with these and other health risks. The majority of the risk from space travel stem of the two components of the space environment which are microgravity and radiation. Two specific systemic effects have been uncovered by us to impact the body as a whole due to the space environment. One factor is related from our earlier work (Beheshti et al, PLOS One, 2018), we predicted that there is a systemic component of the host that causes general increased health risks due to spaceflight driven by a circulating microRNA (miRNA) signature consisting of 13 miRNAs that directly regulates both p53 and TGF1. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules with a negative and post-transcriptional regulation on gene expression) are increasingly recognized as major systemic regulators of responses to stressors, including microgravity, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. In addition, due to the size and stability of miRNAs, it is known that miRNAs can circulate throughout the body and have been found in the majority of the bodily fluids including blood, urine, saliva, and tears. Here, we start to dissect the actual impact of this miRNA signature on both the radiation and microgravity components and prove that this miRNA signature actually exists in the circulation of a host. The other systemic factor we uncovered was the impact the mitochondria on the whole body due to spaceflight. We hypothesize that spaceflight may promote a physiologic response driven by systemic mitochondria pathways leading to metabolic disorder stemming from the liver and directly impacting other organs and tissues. A systems biology method was implemented utilizing GeneLab datasets that involved in vitro experiments performed at the low Earth orbit, in vivo experiments involving mice flown to space, and finally human physiological data from astronauts. A comprehensive multi-omics approach was implemented which involved correlating transcriptomic analysis with proteomics, metabolomics, and methylation analysis. This approach led us to confirm our hypothesis that a systemic mitochondrial driven response is responsible for increasing potential health risk and is conserved from the in vitro studies, to the in vivo studies, and finally confirmed in astronauts.","[{""submissionId"":20190030357,""id"":""029a6220eca64030bcd65d1849c42d28"",""publicationDate"":""2019-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190030357

20170001737,OTHER,Review of NASA's Evidence Reports on Human Health Risks,"[""Scott-Conner, Carol E. H."",""Masys, Daniel R."",""Liverman, Catharyn T.""]","NASA has requested a study from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to provide an independent review of more than 30 evidence reports on human health risks for long duration and exploration spaceflight. The evidence reports, which are publicly available, are categorized into five broad categories: (1) behavioral health and performance; (2) human health countermeasures (with a focus on bone metabolism and orthopedics, nutrition, immunology, and cardiac and pulmonary physiology); (3) radiation; (4) human factors issues; and (5) exploration medical capabilities. The reports are revised on an ongoing basis to incorporate new scientific information. In conducting this study, an IOM ad hoc committee will build on the 2008 IOM report Review of NASA's Human Research Program Evidence Books. That report provided an assessment of the process used for developing the evidence reports and provided an initial review of the evidence reports that had been completed at that time. Each year, NASA staff will identify a set of evidence reports for committee review. Over the course of the study all evidence reports will be reviewed. The committee will hold an annual scientific workshop to receive input on the evidence reports it is reviewing that year and an update on the recent literature. The committee will issue an annual letter report that addresses the following questions relevant to each evidence report: 1. Does the evidence report provide sufficient evidence, as well as sufficient risk context, that the risk is of concern for long-term space missions? 2. Does the evidence report make the case for the research gaps presented? 3.

20250001454,OTHER,Risk of Adverse Cognitive or Behavioral Changes and Psychiatric Disorders Leading to In-Mission Health and Performance and Long-Term Health Effects,"[""Sheena I Dev"",""Sara E Whiting"",""Gregory A Nelson"",""Vonetta Dotson"",""Ajitkumar Mulavara"",""Julia M Schorn"",""Thomas J Williams""]","The exploration spaceflight environment poses unique stressors to human health and performance. These challenges pose a significant and still unknown risk to astronauts’ behavioral health and performance (BHP). Even with excellent astronaut selection methods, a possibility remains that crewmembers could sustain behavioral health problems that may threaten mission success. The Risk of Adverse Cognitive or Behavioral Changes and Psychiatric Disorders Leading to In-Mission Health and Performance and Long-Term Health Effects (Behavioral Health) emphasizes the need to characterize cognitive and behavioral outcomes, develop tools to monitor behavioral health, and ultimately implement countermeasures to prevent, mitigate, or treat adverse cognitive and behavioral changes that may lead to significant adverse in-mission BHP or long-term health effects. Since the last publication of this evidence book, the Behavioral Health risk knowledge base characterizing cognitive and psychological outcomes in both spaceflight and ground analog environments has significantly increased, and initiated interdisciplinary collaboration to integrate research topics across 3 high-impact spaceflight hazard exposures—space radiation, isolation, and altered gravity—has been implemented, and integrated animal studies reviewing radiation induced behavioral effects have been conducted.

Evidence from spaceflight and from studies in environments analogous to spaceflight suggest that the average incidence rate of an adverse behavioral health event occurring during a space mission is relatively low for current missions of up to 6 months in low Earth orbit (LEO). Although subclinical mood and anxiety disturbances have occurred, no behavioral emergencies have been reported to date during spaceflight. However, anecdotal evidence, subject matter expert consensus and empirical evidence all indicate that the likelihood of an adverse cognitive or behavioral change or a psychiatric disorder occurring rises with increases with mission duration, distance from Earth, and greater exposure to spaceflight hazards. Three high-impact spaceflight hazards—radiation exposure outside of LEO, isolation and confinement, and altered gravity—are expected to exert combined effects on the central nervous system (CNS), and subsequently crew cognition, behavior, and performance. Thus, interdisciplinary research efforts are underway to fully characterize multiple pathways by which behavioral health may be impacted and thus mitigated. This includes efforts to develop animal and cell models to elucidate radiation induced behavioral and pathophysiological effects and to establish approaches to extrapolate risk to humans. Taken together these studies have documented increases in anxiety and depression-like behaviors and decrements on specific tasks of cognitive functions in rodents after exposure to mission relevant doses, such as those of near-term long-duration lunar missions.","[{""volume"":"""",""submissionId"":20250001454,""publisher"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""id"":""f4b4ea2ec67048749433f785ec6fee33"",""publicationName"":"""",""publicationDate"":""2025-04-10T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""951922.YY.ZZ""]",undefined,"[""Behavioral Sciences"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250001454
20250000191,POSTER,Proof-of-Concept for a Long-Term Health Metric to Quantify End of Mission Health Status in Astronauts,"[""Matthew Prelich"",""Christopher Gallo"",""Hunter Rehm"",""Drayton Munster"",""Suleyman Gokoglu"",""Beth Lewandowski"",""Lauren McIntyre"",""Jerry G Myers, Jr"",""Prashant Parmar"",""Eric Kerstman""]","NASA has long used Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) when high-stakes decisions need to be made about complex systems. For spaceflight medical risk, the Human Research Program’s Medical Extensible Dynamic Probabilistic Risk Assessment Tool (MEDPRAT) is a significant step towards robustly quantifying the risk to crew health during exploration missions. However, there remains a significant gap in the ability to comprehensively characterize and assess risk across the disparate functionalities and capabilities which comprise the entire Crew Health and Performance (CHP) system.

To fill this gap, the Crew Health and Performance – Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CHP-PRA) project aims to perform risk characterization for the CHP system by assessing performance risk in addition to medical risk. This effort also includes quantifying Long-Term Health (LTH) risk in addition to in-mission risk outcomes within the CHP-PRA results. LTH risk encompasses the timeframe from immediately post-flight, through the rest of an astronaut’s career, through retirement, and until death. A proof-of-concept LTH risk metric is based on medical condition end-state, as defined by the Evidence Library, capturing the spaceflight specific medical impacts persisting into post-flight[1]. Condition outcomes in the Evidence Library progress through three Clinical Phases (CP): the diagnostic phase (CP1), the treatment/convalescent phase (CP2), and the end-state phase (CP3) which represents the detrimental effects of the condition after the crew member has recovered to the maximal extent. Each CP has an associated Task Impairment (TI), defined as the degree of crew incapacity due to experiencing the condition, and is quantified with a 0-1 range. Conditions with an associated CP3 (e.g. Sepsis, Traumatic Hypovolemic Shock, Sudden Cardiac Arrest, etc.) typically have serious consequences that can cause an astronaut to be fully or partially debilitated throughout the remainder of the mission. Consequently, the Cumulative CP3 TI End-of-Mission Health Status Metric is developed by CHP-PRA to quantify the cumulative effects of all conditions which progressed to the CP3 state throughout the entirety of the mission. Hence, this End-of-Mission Health Status Metric attempts to serve as an indicator of an astronaut’s health state at the time of landing. 

The severity of the lingering effects of in-mission medical events are dependent on mission activities and the level of available in-mission medical care. This allows the associated cumulative TI metric to be used in comparison with the crew’s end of mission health status for different levels of in-mission resources. This presentation provides the strategy for using CP3 as an LTH metric component, as well as a proof-of-concept demonstration of LTH risk characterization using this component.

Immune profiling results revealed unique immune diversity following each experimental condition, suggesting each stressor results in distinct circulating immune responses, with clear consequences for deep spaceflight. Circulating plasma microRNA sequence analysis revealed involvement in immune system dysregulation.

Plants grown in the Veggie and APH units on the ISS currently provide the astronauts with a hefty dose of vitamins and minerals, but some nutrients could be improved. Agronomic Biofortifcation of crops with fertilizers has been tested on Earth, with the successful addition of minerals and vitamin C to crops that have otherwise been deficient. We intend to test if we can replicate this in a controlled environment and expand it to nutrients that are not often present in abundance in plants. This will be done by adding fluid nutrient blends to the water supply of candidate crops for spaceflight applications. We hypothesize that fertilization of plants with nutrients that are of value to human health will have neutral to positive effect on plants, with desired nutrients present in greater abundance in treated plants than untreated plants. We intend to show this through germination percent and pace, yield of edible biomass, the growth rate, and overall development of the crop plant. For this experiment, radish microgreens were grown on mats in a controlled environment chamber in enriched CO2, with LED lighting similar to what is found in the ISS Veggie hardware. Watering was conducted once at planting with a specialized blend of ½ strength Hoagland’s hydroponic solution with additional vitamins. Preliminary results show no decrease in overall biomass production with plants grown using additional vitamin D, but additional nutrients will be tested.

This is critical to address, since the cumulative effects of these stressors during spaceflight may result in unexpected negative impacts on crew health and performance that neither condition alone would predict, thus limiting the ability to develop effective countermeasures. Previously, we showed that both spaceflight and spaceflight analogue culture increased the virulence and pathogenesis-related characteristics of the foodborne pathogen, Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), which is responsible for disqualification of food destined for the International Space Station and Salmonella spp. have been found aboard NASA spacecraft. Recently, we demonstrated that spaceflight-analogue culture of S. Typhimurium increased its ability to infect 3-D biomimetic human intestinal tissue models. In a separate study, we showed low dose radiation damaged our 3-D intestinal models. The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate the possibility that low dose radiation will exacerbate the already increased bacterial pathogenicity of S. Typhimurium observed following spaceflight analogue culture. In addition, we will determine the impact of a radiation countermeasure to provide protection against both radiation and pathogen-induced tissue damage and inflammation. 

Hypothesis: The already enhanced infection potential of spaceflight analogue cultured S. Typhimurium will be further exacerbated when used to infect host cells exposed to low dose radiation and this enhanced pathogenicity can be mitigated by a radioprotective compound. 

Aims: 1. Characterize the impact of spaceflight-analogue culture on the ability of S. Typhimurium to infect 3-D biomimetic intestinal tissue models before and after exposure to low dose radiation. 2. Evaluate the ability of the radioprotective compound, EC-18, to protect 3-D intestinal models from low dose radiation, S. Typhimurium infection, and the cumulative impact of these stressors. 

Significance: Current infectious disease risk assessments for spaceflight do not consider the potential for increased susceptibility to infection and disease resulting from exposure to low dose radiation, which is a critical consideration. This study will provide key evidence to determine if exposure to low dose radiation may be a factor in astronaut susceptibility to infection during long duration exploration missions and the impact of selected countermeasures to mitigate that risk to crew health.

Key areas of focus include how various space-related stressors impact the complex interplay between the gut microbiome, immune responses, and mental health outcomes. This is illustrated by the effects of space radiation and circadian rhythm disruptions on the microbiome, as well as the roles of immune regulation and the integrity of gut and blood-brain barriers in shaping mental health outcomes through the gut-brain axis.

Mark"",""Oubre, Cherie"",""Wallace, Sarah"",""Mehta, Satish"",""Pierson, Duane""]","While preventive measures limit the presence of many medically significant microorganisms during spaceflight missions, microbial infection of crewmembers cannot be completely prevented. Spaceflight experiments over the past 50 years have demonstrated a unique microbial response to spaceflight culture, although the mechanisms behind those responses and their operational relevance were unclear. In 2007, the operational importance of these microbial responses was emphasized as the results of an experiment aboard STS-115 demonstrated that the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) increased in virulence in a murine model of infection. The experiment was reproduced in 2008 aboard STS-123 confirming this finding. In response to these findings, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies recommended that NASA investigate this risk and its potential impact on the health of the crew during spaceflight. NASA assigned this risk to the Human Research Program.

20220000499,PRESENTATION,Retrospectives: Intersection of Spaceflight Stressors and Microbial Risk to Crew and Craft,"[""Jared Broddrick""]","OVERVIEW
The spaceflight environment has several unique stressors that affect the health of both the crew and the spacecraft. An area of continued, albeit incomplete, study is the interaction of these stressors on microbial populations inherent to   both   astronauts   and   spacecraft   surfaces   and   systems.  A  primary   concern   is   the   potential   for   the   spaceflight environment to perturb the phenotype of these populations towards negative outcomes for crew and craft. In order to effectively mitigate these potential risks, they must first be characterized. We performed a retrospective literature analysis to assess the current state of knowledge regarding the affects of ionizing radiation and elevated CO2  on relevant microbial populations. The results of these retrospectives will guide next steps in the decisions of what (if any) further studies should be pursued and to guide decisions of the need for countermeasures.  
STRESSORS
Ionizing radiation. The health risk involved with increased exposure to cosmic radiation has been studied in crew for 35+ years, with human health and cancer risk being the main focus. However, space radiation could also affect both the resident microorganisms aboard the ISS and the normal, healthy astronaut microbiomes that are of direct concern for   crew   health.  A  retrospective   review   of   over   250   publications   was   accomplished   looking   at   the   impact   of cumulative ionizing radiation doses lower than 3 Gy (chronic or acute) on microbial populations. 
Elevated CO2. The health risk involved with elevated atmospheric CO2 in spacecraft, primarily focusing on human toxicological   risks,   is   understudied.   The   current   Spaceflight   Maximum   Allowance   Concentration   for   24-hour average   CO2  is   0.4%   (3   mm   Hg),   which   is   significantly   higher   than   terrestrial   levels   (0.04%).   Whether   these elevated   ambient   CO2  levels   aboard   spacecraft   influence   the   diversity   and   phenotypic   responses   of   the   resident microbial communities from both the spacecraft environment (air, surface, water) and crew members (gut, nasal,skin microbiomes) is not known.   A retrospective review was accomplished looking at the impact of chronic CO2 exposure up to 0.7% (5 mm Hg) for up to 6 months and acute exposure up to 2.6% (20 mm Hg) for up to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: MICROBIOME OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
The   microbiome   of   the   built   spacecraft   environment   has   been   sampled   consistently   over   the   course   of   human spaceflight   and   significant   advancements   have   been   made   in   identifying   microbial   populations   on   the   ISS.  The dominant source of microbes on spacecraft surfaces are human-derived. Once in the spacecraft built environment,the extreme environment selects for features that enhance survival. While efforts to understand potential antibiotic resistance   and   pathogenicity   of   ISS   isolates   is   robust,   there   is   little   to   no   understanding   of   which   spaceflight environmental   stressors,   to   include   ionizing   radiation   or   elevated   CO2,   drive   the   evolutionary   trajectory   of spacecraft-associated microbial populations.  
CONCLUSIONS: MICROBE-HOST INTERACTIONS
The host-microbiome field has emerged as an important factor in human health on Earth as well in spaceflight. The field  is struggling with   the   complexity   of   the   system   under   investigation   as   there   is   substantial   taxonomic   and functional heterogeneity in these communities, making it difficult to establish clear stimulus-response dynamics.Taxonomic characterization is the norm; however, the functional role of each community member is key to linking environmental perturbations to potential dysbiosis. For both ionizing radiation and elevated CO2, the likely target of the perturbation is the host tissue, not the microbes themselves.. Any resulting changes to the microbial community composition and/or function is likely a result of adapting to those changes in the host physiology. RECOMMENDATIONS
Emphasize functional characterization as opposed to taxonomic characterization of microbial communities.Increase the number of investigations using chronic, spaceflight-relevant doses of ionizing radiation. 
MoBE studies should move away from observational studies towards predictive modeling of community dynamics. 
Continue to develop scale-down models, such as tissues-on-a-chip & defined microbial communities. 
Focus on the crew response to elevated CO2 over MoBE considerations. 
Assess how direct contact with the hypercapnic environment affects skin microbiome dynamics.

Current exercise countermeasures on the International Space Station (ISS) include treadmill running, cycle ergometry, and resistive exercise, which are used to protect crewmember health and performance during long-duration spaceflight. However, exploration vehicles for Artemis missions to the Moon and beyond will have volume and power restrictions, requiring exercise hardware to have a smaller footprint and use fewer resources. Thus, recent efforts have focused on developing exercise devices that provide both aerobic and resistive capabilities on one platform without including a treadmill. The European Enhanced Exploration Exercise Device [E4D] is one such apparatus. It is critical to validate the efficacy of using exploration-focused exercise modalities to preserve muscle strength, aerobic fitness, bone density, and sensorimotor performance. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using nominal ISS exercise devices for an entire mission compared to exploration-forward exercise modalities to determine if a treadmill is required to maintain current levels of protection during long-duration missions.

METHODS
Crewmembers are assigned to one of three groups: 1) Controls (n ≥ 40), who partake in nominal exercise on the ISS, including running on the Treadmill with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization 2 (T2), cycling on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (CEVIS), and strength training on the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED); 2) Active Group 1, who exercise on the CEVIS and ARED only (n = 8); and 3) Active Group 2, who perform aerobic and resistive exercise on the E4D only (n = 8). For Active Group 1, nominal exercise on T2 will be replaced with corresponding exercise on CEVIS. For Active Group 2, a dedicated exercise prescription will be designed to maximize the capabilities of the E4D to include resistive exercise, cycle ergometry, rowing, and rope pulling. Crewmembers in both Active groups are not permitted to perform treadmill exercise for the entirety of their flight. Health and performance markers, including bone mineral density (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]), body composition (DXA), cardiovascular fitness (cycle VO2peak), muscle strength and endurance (isometric/isokinetic testing, power endurance testing), sensorimotor performance (sit-to-stand, obstacle course), postural control (computerized dynamic posturography), and blood and urine biochemical markers of bone metabolism will be assessed before, during, and after spaceflight. 

RESULTS
Fifteen subjects (4 Active [CEVIS + ARED], 11 Control) have been recruited. Data collection is ongoing.

CONCLUSIONS
This study will assess the efficacy of using exploration exercise modalities, including removing the treadmill exercise capability or exclusively using the E4D, compared to the nominal ISS exercise regimen across an entire mission on bone, muscle, aerobic, and sensorimotor health and performance. Findings from this study will help provide a recommendation on whether these exploration exercise modalities can sufficiently protect against physiological deconditioning during spaceflight or whether a treadmill may be required to maintain current levels of protection during future exploration class spaceflight missions.

Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) is a methodology applied when high-stakes decisions need to be made about complex systems. PRA often uses risk minimization to aid decision making, such as when establishing vehicle requirements or resource allocations. The NASA Human System Risk Board (HSRB) maintains the human spaceflight risk postures, many of which have in-mission medical outcomes, but the full risk set also includes performance and Long-Term Health (LTH) outcomes. An effort is underway to determine the dependencies between LTH risk outcomes and mission characteristics and to identify metrics for quantifying LTH outcomes. The LTH metrics will be incorporated into future PRA tools currently under development to support crew health and performance decision making.

LONG-TERM HEALTH (LTH) RISK
LTH risk encompasses the timeframe from immediately post-flight, through the rest of an astronaut’s career, through retirement, and until death. LTH outcomes include the time and interventions needed for the astronaut to return to preflight physiological states after experiencing spaceflight hazards and recovery from any in-mission medical events that persist into the post-flight timeframe. It includes chronic complications that may arise due to experiencing in-flight medical conditions or injuries and medical conditions that occur later in life with a higher probability of occurrence or with more severity because of their spaceflight exposure. Finally, LTH outcomes can also include a reduction in life expectancy due to spaceflight exposures. Eighteen of the HSRB risks contain an LTH component, each with a unique incidence rate and consequence severity.    

ON-GOING LTH METRIC DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS
Based on guidance from a stakeholder workshop held on June 1, 2023, only LTH outcomes with causes tied to spaceflight experience that are significantly different from normal healthy aging and which can be affected by changes in in-mission resources are targeted for inclusion within the PRA modeling efforts. Current on-going efforts include a sensitivity analysis of potential in-flight medical conditions to determine which conditions may persist into post-flight and how the consequences may be affected by in-mission medical resources. Also underway is determination of differences in the time for a return to preflight physiological baselines when in-flight countermeasures are available versus when they are not. Analyses performed with publicly available astronaut data and collaborations with the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health team are being designed to understand which LTH outcomes differ significantly from natural healthy aging. Information exchanges are also occurring with LTH risk custodians to understand how they quantify outcomes. 

FUTURE PLANS
Risk characteristics will be determined for each LTH risk that meets our inclusion criteria and the dependencies of their outcomes to in-mission resources and mission characteristics will be established.

The purpose of this project is to begin bringing those concepts into real-life. The goal and primary study for this project is to research and understand the physics behind making a rotating centrifuge and the human limitations that may contribute to the design. The research first started with finding the physics equations we can use to calculate the rotational speed required for a certain gravity or the required radius for the centrifuge structure, this equation is a(sub c) = v2/r = w(sub c)2 r, where v is linear velocity, r is the radius of the structure, and is the rotational speed. Next, it is important to understand AG may be worthwhile because of the negative health effects of microgravity. The research then leads to finding human limitations in a rotating structure. The main limitation of a human living in this habitat is the Coriolis effect, which causes discomfort and motion sickness in the subject inside the structure, this causes the three semicircular fluid canals in your head that sense balance and motion. Finally, we use that knowledge to best hypothesize and propose the radius size for the structure that would negate the Coriolis effect, and using that we can calculate the appropriate rotational speed to get the desired gravity level, for example: 1 g or 9.81 m/s2 of acceleration. Overall this research can encourage increase knowledge in understanding AG, the physics and human limitation in a rotating centrifuge on future NASA long-duration Missions and Goals. This research can be a reference to future design proposals for long-duration exploration missions and colonization of planets or moons.","[{""submissionId"":20205004959,""id"":""134547736c344a2ea626cc85a0f3f169"",""publicationDate"":""2020-08-07T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20205004959,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""68603dff261e5d2d9de5a550aa9e6b30"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Langley Research Center"",""location"":""Hampton, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""2cd2eb454d074112bc41ffdbe7e98f64"",""id"":""1b83a2a803a34c08987e4ad7ffbd6aec""}],""name"":""Summer Interns 2020 Exit Deliverable Presentations"",""location"":""Online"",""id"":""2cd2eb454d074112bc41ffdbe7e98f64"",""startDate"":""2020-07-31T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNX15AI20H""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205004959

R."",""Konstantinova, I."",""Sonnenfeld, G."",""Jennings, R.""]","The results of immunological analyses before, during and after spaceflight, have established the fact that spaceflight can result in a blunting of the immune mechanisms of human crew members and animal test species. There is some evidence that the immune function changes in short-term flights resemble those occurring after acute stress, while the changes during long-term flights resemble those caused by chronic stress. In addition, this blunting of the immune function occurs concomitant with a relative increase in potentially infectious microorganisms in the space cabin environment. This combination of events results in an increased probability of inflight infectious events. The realization of this probability has been shown to be partially negated by the judicious use of a preflight health stabilization program and other operational countermeasures. The continuation of these countermeasures, as well as microbial and immunological monitoring, are recommended for continued spaceflight safety.","[{""volume"":""6"",""submissionId"":20040173065,""issn"":""1569-2574"",""id"":""ff86e482328240079172ce518b6300e8"",""publicationName"":""Advances in space biology and medicine"",""publicationDate"":""1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040173065

20150023260,ABSTRACT,NASA Human System Risk Assessment Process,"[""Francisco, D."",""Romero, E.""]","NASA utilizes an evidence based system to perform risk assessments for the human system for spaceflight missions. The center of this process is the multi-disciplinary Human System Risk Board (HSRB). The HSRB is chartered from the Chief Health and Medical Officer (OCHMO) at NASA Headquarters. The HSRB reviews all human system risks via an established comprehensive risk and configuration management plan based on a project management approach. The HSRB facilitates the integration of human research (terrestrial and spaceflight), medical operations, occupational surveillance, systems engineering and many other disciplines in a comprehensive review of human system risks. The HSRB considers all factors that influence human risk. These factors include pre-mission considerations such as screening criteria, training, age, sex, and physiological condition. In mission factors such as available countermeasures, mission duration and location and post mission factors such as time to return to baseline (reconditioning), post mission health screening, and available treatments. All of the factors influence the total risk assessment for each human risk. The HSRB performed a comprehensive review of all potential inflight medical conditions and events and over the course of several reviews consolidated the number of human system risks to 30, where the greatest emphasis is placed for investing program dollars for risk mitigation. The HSRB considers all available evidence from human research and, medical operations and occupational surveillance in assessing the risks for appropriate mitigation and future work. All applicable DRMs (low earth orbit for 6 and 12 months, deep space for 30 days and 1 year, a lunar mission for 1 year, and a planetary mission for 3 years) are considered as human system risks are modified by the hazards associated with space flight such as microgravity, exposure to radiation, distance from the earth, isolation and a closed environment. Each risk has a summary two-page assessment representing the state of knowledge/evidence of that risk, available risk mitigations, traceability to the Space Flight Human System Standards (SFHSS) and program requirements, and future work required. These data then can drive coordinated budgets across the Human Research Program, the International Space Station, Crew Health and Safety and Advanced Exploration System budgets to provide the most economical and timely mitigations. The risk assessments were completed for the 6 DRMs and serve as the baseline for which subsequent research and technology development and crew health care portfolios can be assessed. The HSRB reviews each risk at least annually or when new evidence/information is available that adds to the body of evidence. The current status of each risk can be reported to program management for operations, budget reviews and general oversight of the human system risk management program.","[{""submissionId"":20150023260,""id"":""7bea2522bd944ecc97d881b09d086ebb"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150023260,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""e788048b9ed04d56aee296d1b072996d""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150023260,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""593625539b9d49908ae27fa23d766dd7"",""id"":""22868c7bc8eb4ec08198ff4d8b8960cd""}],""name"":""2016 Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""593625539b9d49908ae27fa23d766dd7"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20160001745,""title"":""NASA's Human System Risk Assessment Process""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150023260

The scientists and engineers of the Human Research Program (HRP) investigate and reduce the greatest risks to human health and performance, and provide essential countermeasures and technologies for human space exploration. In its seventh year of operation, the HRP continued to refine its management architecture of evidence, risks, gaps, tasks, and deliverables. Experiments continued on the International Space Station (ISS), on the ground in analog environments that have features similar to those of spaceflight, and in laboratory environments. Data from these experiments furthered the understanding of how the space environment affects the human system. These research results contributed to scientific knowledge and technology developments that address the human health and performance risks. As shown in this report, HRP has made significant progress toward developing medical care and countermeasure systems for space exploration missions which will ultimately reduce risks to crew health and performance.","[{""submissionId"":20130000803,""id"":""e25b670c22d14993b3db2465c09954d8"",""publicationDate"":""2012-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20130000803
20220009987,POSTER,The Effects of Spaceflight and Microgravity Exposure on Female Astronaut Health and Performance ,"[""Nicole Christine Strock"",""Eric Rivas"",""Karina J Marshall-bowman""]","Over the past half century, our understanding of the physiological effects of space exploration and microgravity exposure have improved immensely. Microgravity causes incredible changes to the human body that increase risk of injury upon return to Earth and lunar/planetary egress scenarios. This is due to deconditioning of the cardiovascular and skeletal muscle systems that reduce aerobic capacity and muscular strength. With upcoming exploration class missions, such as NASA’s Artemis lunar exploration program which aims to send the first female astronaut to the lunar surface by 2030, as well as a long-term goal of Martian exploration, maintaining astronaut health during extended-duration space flight is critical for achieving mission objectives. However, our understanding of these physiological implications due to microgravity are based primarily on flight studies of male astronauts and 1g bedrest analog study participants, with few investigations focusing specifically on females. Innate physiologic differences in endocrine signaling and reproductive function impact sex-dependent responses to various health conditions, treatments, and environmental factors in nearly every system in the body. Therefore, to assume comparable alterations in females in response to microgravity exposure may be inappropriate and consequentially, could lead to lasting impacts on female astronaut health and impact mission success. Moreover, differences in sex hormones may also influence the regulation of cardiovascular control during egress activity after space flight-induced deconditioning and blood volume loss (i.e., risk for orthostatic intolerance). Other potential physiological systems and factors related to musculoskeletal health and aerobic capacity that warrant investigation with respect to microgravity include endocrine/reproductive function, vascular control, bone mineral density/microarchitecture, and soft-tissue health. The purpose of this investigation is two-fold: 1) to summarize the data available from space flight and simulated bedrest analog exposures to begin addressing these gaps in knowledge regarding impacts to female astronaut health, and 2) to describe differences in demographic health characteristics, injury prevalence, and aerobic capacity and muscular strength in NASA female and male astronauts. Female astronauts make up 50% of Artemis-specific astronaut corps and the extent to which microgravity exposure impacts female cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health, and whether these alterations are consistent with their male counterparts, is inconclusive. With the growing inclusion of female astronauts in the NASA space program and the increased duration of missions beyond low Earth orbit, a greater understanding of the sex-specific adaptation to space travel will help determine the development of appropriate countermeasures for minimizing risk and maintaining health of all astronauts.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220009987,""endDate"":""2023-03-11T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""Reston, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""8bea26d86d2b45218df3902cbed21ba9"",""id"":""e9994f0a663042908a4f3a521313218c""},{""organizationId"":""8af3236884f245a5bac7fc9648e4475a"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Prognostics and Health Management Society"",""location"":""Nashville, TN""}},""meetingId"":""8bea26d86d2b45218df3902cbed21ba9"",""id"":""c638216919064075b403e5379e599d02""}],""name"":""IEEE Aerospace Conference"",""location"":""Big Sky, Montana"",""id"":""8bea26d86d2b45218df3902cbed21ba9"",""url"":""https://aeroconf.org/"",""startDate"":""2023-03-04T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220009987

Broyan"",""Andrew Abercromby"",""Alexander Burg""]","Human spaceflight is a complex endeavor requiring multiple capabilities for transportation, crew health, scientific goals, and safe return to Earth.  The difference between spaceflight proven capabilities and those needed for future exploration architectures is defined as a capability gap.  Capability gaps are not technology specific.  Each capability gap may be closed with a wide array of technologies that have unique benefits and challenges.  Determining what a capability’s relevant and distinguishing key performance parameters (KPPs) are for a mission is critical.  Mass, power, and volume are always constrained and important, but defining these in a way normalized by performance is very important.  KPP definition for reliability, dormancy, and integration needs are hard to define but critical. Outside of technical considerations, the programmatic factors of the estimated time to develop the technology and how the technology validation objectives are matured are strong considerations in which technologies should be pursued and how they should leverage earlier mission elements.  The Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLSS) and Crew Health and Performance (CHP) capability areas are decomposed to high level gaps. While KPPs should  be technology agnostic, they can be used to both compare technologies and measure progress of technology development over time.  KPPs help define when the gap is closed, and the core mission objectives can be accomplished.  Proposed technology improvements to enhance a capability should balance improved KPPs and against investments in other capabilities that are not yet closed.

20230014415,PRESENTATION,Effects of Low Dose Radiation and Radiation Countermeasures on Infection By Spaceflight Analogue Cultured Salmonella Using 3-D Biomimetic Human Tissue Models,"[""Jennifer Barrila"",""Sandhya Gangaraju"",""Laura Banken"",""Jiseon Yang"",""Richard R Davis"",""Audrie A Medina-Colorado"",""Ji Sun Park"",""Eleanor A Blakely"",""Phillip Stafford"",""C Mark Ott"",""Cheryl A Nickerson""]","While both microgravity and radiation are major biological stressors associated with the spaceflight environment, their cumulative impact on host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease risks are rarely considered. This is critical to address, since the cumulative effects of these stressors during spaceflight may result in unexpected negative impacts on crew health and performance that neither condition alone would predict, thus limiting the ability to develop effective countermeasures. Previously, we showed that both spaceflight and spaceflight analogue culture increased the virulence and pathogenesis-related characteristics of the foodborne pathogen, Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), which is responsible for disqualification of food destined for the International Space Station and Salmonella spp. have been found aboard NASA spacecraft. Recently, we demonstrated that spaceflight-analogue culture of S. Typhimurium increased its ability to infect 3-D biomimetic human intestinal tissue models. In a separate study, we showed low dose radiation damaged our 3-D intestinal models. The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate the possibility that low dose radiation will exacerbate the already increased bacterial pathogenicity of S. Typhimurium observed following spaceflight analogue culture. In addition, we will determine the impact of a radiation countermeasure to provide protection against both radiation and pathogen-induced tissue damage and inflammation. 

Hypothesis: The already enhanced infection potential of spaceflight analogue cultured S. Typhimurium will be further exacerbated when used to infect host cells exposed to low dose radiation and this enhanced pathogenicity can be mitigated by a radioprotective compound. Aims: 1.Characterize the impact of spaceflight-analogue culture on the ability of S. Typhimurium to infect 3-D biomimetic intestinal tissue models before and after exposure to low dose radiation. 2. Evaluate the ability of the radioprotective compound, EC-18, to protect 3-D intestinal models from low dose radiation, S. Typhimurium infection, and the cumulative impact of these stressors. 

Significance: Current infectious disease risk assessments for spaceflight do not consider the potential for increased susceptibility to infection and disease resulting from exposure to low dose radiation, which is a critical consideration. This study will provide key evidence to determine if exposure to low dose radiation may be a factor in astronaut susceptibility to infection during long duration exploration missions and the impact of selected countermeasures to mitigate that risk to crew health.

20250000414,POSTER,Results for the Subjective Habitability Acceptability Questionnaire From HERA C5 and C6,"[""C A Spencer"",""J C W Miller"",""L B Landon""]","BACKGROUND 
The impact of habitability on psychological and performance outcomes is recognized as an important factor in habitat and vehicle design—especially as missions increase in length. Formal evaluation of habitability’s impact is possible using the Spaceflight Habitability Acceptability Questionnaire (SHAQ), which was psychometrically validated by Roma et al. in 2022 [1]. The SHAQ survey systematically quantifies the relationships between habitat areas (e.g., bedroom, kitchen, hygiene area, office, etc.) and behavioral health and performance (BHP) outcomes (i.e., individual and team performance, mood, stress, sleep, social interaction), and considers the moderating effects of key habitability aspects (i.e., privacy, control, convenience, efficiency, comfort, social density) on that relationship. 

METHOD
Respondents were HERA participants from Campaign 5 and 6 (n = 32). Data from three environments were used in our SHAQ analyses: SHAQ in HERA (in-mission), SHAQ at Home (pre-mission), and SHAQ in Hotel (pre- and post-mission for C6, just pre-mission for C5). For each habitat area, respondents are asked how that area layout impacts six BHP outcomes on a 201-point visual analog scale with the anchors: impairs, has no effect, and facilitates. They also had the option to respond “Not Applicable”. Follow up questions asked why six key habitability aspects (e.g., privacy) influenced the way the habitat area affected a given outcome. Participants indicated whether a habitat area’s habitability aspects were inadequate (low score) to adequate (midpoint) to ideal (high score), using a 201-point visual analog scale as well but were binned to a 7-point scale for analyses. 

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
When comparing across environments, ratings of BHP outcomes were worse in HERA compared to home and pre-mission hotel, but rebounded for the post-mission hotel such that post-mission hotel rating were often higher than all previous ratings. Within HERA, ratings of how a habitat area impacted an outcome skewed towards facilitation with communal areas (i.e., galley and office) rated most facilitating. The follow up questions about why six key aspects related to habitability moderated outcomes indicated that most habitat areas were rated as having “adequate” habitability characteristics. Privacy was the only moderator with average scores below adequate for all habitat areas. The office had the most moderators scoring above adequate for all habitat areas. Ratings indicated small to moderate effects of layouts on BHP outcomes: with facilitating layouts averaging between 4 and 5, and impairing layouts averaging between 2 and 4. The sleeping module layout facilitated sleep, with ratings indicating adequate comfort but inadequate privacy. The galley layout facilitated social interaction and mood, with ratings indicating adequate efficiency and convenience. The office layout facilitated social interaction, team and individual performance, with ratings similarly indicating adequate efficiency and convenience. The hygiene module worsened individual performance, mood and stress, with ratings indicating less than adequate privacy and social density. Our findings suggest there is value in having dedicated team and individual spaces.

In harmonizing the risk of human space flight, answering the question of ‘How do we balance health, performance and resource risks with other engineering risks on long duration space missions?’ remains a deeply challenging and largely qualitative practice. The Medical Extensible Dynamic Probabilistic Risk Assessment Tool (MEDPRAT) is one aspect of the efforts by NASA’s Human Research Program (HRP) to quantitatively assess the impact of health and performance risk. 

One of MEDPRAT’s key features is its high degree of computational efficiency. Coupled with the HRP High Performance Compute cluster located at NASA’s Glenn Research Center, MEDPRAT runs millions of simulated missions in a matter of minutes. This degree of computational efficiency provides the novel opportunity to explore the relationship between medical set mass, volume, and medical resource size. 

Of particular interest for future human spaceflight missions are ‘bulky’ items, medical resources like devices, which occupy a large portion of the small, allocated mass and volume for the medical set leaving less room for other resources. This talk will present results showing the quantitative impact of forced inclusion of several bulky items across a variety of medical kit constraints, and the effect that a potential research investment into reducing the bulky item mass and volume may have on risk.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240001436,""endDate"":""2024-02-16T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""4c6a2b878d76521da887cdcb2564bf90"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, Texas, United States""}},""meetingId"":""609c457444db47529e974871bace94cf"",""id"":""9f48c21fc0b546ffbcddbf0896c113c2""},{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""609c457444db47529e974871bace94cf"",""id"":""a2ec1e71a1414e87bbe0541743ecf993""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators Working Group (HRP-IWG) Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""609c457444db47529e974871bace94cf"",""startDate"":""2024-02-13T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""305041.01.02.10""]",undefined,"[""Space Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240001436

Notably, the classic foodborne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium displayed increased virulence in animals when cultured in either the spaceflight analogue or true spaceflight environment. Recently, Serratia marcescens also was shown to increase virulence when cultured in the spaceflight environment. In parallel, astronaut studies have characterized a persistent spaceflight-induced dysregulation of the human immune system at multiple levels, which suggests an increased risk of infectious diseases.  Moreover, astronauts have some degree of clinical infectious disease incidence. However, the contribution of the microgravity environment on host-pathogen interactions and potential for clinical disease remains understudied and poorly characterized. 

The goal of this study is to gain insight into the breadth of other medically significant microbial pathogens that may exhibit altered virulence and pathogenesis-related responses when cultured in space flight analogue conditions. Specifically, we are characterizing the effect of spaceflight analogue culture (Low Shear Modeled Microgravity/LSMMG) on microbial pathogenesis-related stress responses, in vitro host-pathogen interactions, gene expression, and virulence potential in animals using five important model bacterial pathogens, Salmonella enterica Enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli.

Herein, we present data from one of these pathogens, the foodborne bacterium, S. enterica Enteritidis, which is closely related to S. enterica Typhimurium.  Phenotypes evaluated included growth profiles, environmental stress responses(acid, oxidative, bile, and thermal stresses),and in vitro colonization of3-D biomimetic cultures of human intestinal tissue containing immune cells. Transcriptomic profiling and virulence studies are ongoing. We show that S. Enteritidis exhibited key alterations in pathogenic responses to LSMMG culture that suggest increased infection risk, including several responses which were different from those observed in the closely related pathovar S.

Antarctic health data are reviewed and an assessment made of the likely frequency of behavioral health events. Based on the Antarctic evidence, the likelihood of behavioral health problems in space is low.

20190033192,PRESENTATION,Investigating Neuro-Consequences of Spaceflight Using Drosophila Melanogaster,"[""Iyer, Janani""]","Research on human acclimation to spaceflight, including the recent NASA's Twin Study, reports complex effects of the spaceflight environment on health, with both acute and prolonged changes in multiple tissues. Spaceflight includes multiple factors such as microgravity, ionizing radiation, physiological stress, and disrupted circadian rhythms, that have been shown to contribute to pathophysiological responses that target immunity, bone and muscle integrity, cardiovascular and nervous systems. In this study, we used a well-established spaceflight model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to assess spaceflight-associated changes on the nervous system. With 75% disease gene orthology to humans, short generation time, large sample size and ease of genetic, neuronal and behavioral studies, Drosophila is an excellent model to study nervous system dysfunction. Here, we present results from MVP-Fly-01 spaceflight mission that was launched on SpaceX CRS-14. The MVP hardware (developed by Techshot) used in this mission enabled us to have an in-flight 1g centrifuge, to distinguish the changes resulting from gravity versus those induced by other environmental factors associated with spaceflight. We observe behavioral impairments (p<0.001) and synaptic deficits, including decreased synaptic connections (p<0.05), in 3rd instar larvae which were developed in space. Furthermore, space-grown microgravity adults show a decrease in neuronal (p<0.05) and dendritic field (p<0.01) in adult brains coupled with an increased number of apoptotic cells (p<0.001) compared to in-flight 1g controls, suggesting increased neuronal loss under spaceflight conditions. In summary, we observe that altered gravity leads to gross neurological deficits. To better understand the long-term effects of spaceflight on the nervous system, longitudinal and multigenerational changes were also identified. This study will help elucidate the different approaches to prevent nervous system dysfunction in astronauts during spaceflight, while also contributing to a better understanding of the pathways that are related to some CNS disorders on Earth.","[{""submissionId"":20190033192,""id"":""7c5460005f554624b20ca428fc88fef8"",""publicationDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190033192,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""a96a5035dbd240fa8611c37fd1675b6a""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190033192,""endDate"":""2019-11-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""5e80796db7c84e2eada24484f559aee0"",""id"":""276049a0bf6549078f824825eb92eed1""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""5e80796db7c84e2eada24484f559aee0"",""startDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190033192

20080026132,PREPRINT,Fault Management Techniques in Human Spaceflight Operations,"[""O'Hagan, Brian"",""Crocker, Alan""]","This paper discusses human spaceflight fault management operations. Fault detection and response capabilities available in current US human spaceflight programs Space Shuttle and International Space Station are described while emphasizing system design impacts on operational techniques and constraints. Preflight and inflight processes along with products used to anticipate, mitigate and respond to failures are introduced. Examples of operational products used to support failure responses are presented. Possible improvements in the state of the art, as well as prioritization and success criteria for their implementation are proposed. This paper describes how the architecture of a command and control system impacts operations in areas such as the required fault response times, automated vs. manual fault responses, use of workarounds, etc. The architecture includes the use of redundancy at the system and software function level, software capabilities, use of intelligent or autonomous systems, number and severity of software defects, etc. This in turn drives which Caution and Warning (C&W) events should be annunciated, C&W event classification, operator display designs, crew training, flight control team training, and procedure development. Other factors impacting operations are the complexity of a system, skills needed to understand and operate a system, and the use of commonality vs. optimized solutions for software and responses. Fault detection, annunciation, safing responses, and recovery capabilities are explored using real examples to uncover underlying philosophies and constraints. These factors directly impact operations in that the crew and flight control team need to understand what happened, why it happened, what the system is doing, and what, if any, corrective actions they need to perform. If a fault results in multiple C&W events, or if several faults occur simultaneously, the root cause(s) of the fault(s), as well as their vehicle-wide impacts, must be determined in order to maintain situational awareness. This allows both automated and manual recovery operations to focus on the real cause of the fault(s). An appropriate balance must be struck between correcting the root cause failure and addressing the impacts of that fault on other vehicle components. Lastly, this paper presents a strategy for using lessons learned to improve the software, displays, and procedures in addition to determining what is a candidate for automation. Enabling technologies and techniques are identified to promote system evolution from one that requires manual fault responses to one that uses automation and autonomy where they are most effective. These considerations include the value in correcting software defects in a timely manner, automation of repetitive tasks, making time critical responses autonomous, etc. The paper recommends the appropriate use of intelligent systems to determine the root causes of faults and correctly identify separate unrelated faults.","[{""submissionId"":20080026132,""id"":""d18bc57a126e45508b47b6f41041ee8e"",""publicationDate"":""2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Mathematical And Computer Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080026132

20190000449,PRESENTATION,Flying Through the Ages: Rodent Research for Human Health,"[""Globus, Ruth""]","As humans, we evolved, developed, grew, and now function in a continuous 1-gravity environment. Habitation in space poses unique challenges to human cells and organ systems. Biomedical research with rodents (primarily mice and rats) can help to both unravel molecular, cellular and physiologic mechanisms relevant to humans and test candidate interventions that mitigate adverse effects of space on humans, such as muscle atrophy, bone loss and cardiovascular deconditioning. One favored hypothesis that may explain the detrimental effects of spaceflight on humans is that reduced mechanical loading in microgravity accelerates aging. Rodents provide a relevant model system to study this problem as they age 40 times faster than humans. Now scientists from both public and commercial sectors conduct rodent experiments on the ISS using a new capability developed primarily at ARC. Results from the maiden voyage of the Rodent Research Project on the ISS reveal that long duration effects of spaceflight appear far different than short duration effects. Thus, Rodent Research missions on the ISS usher in a new era for exploration and biological discovery in space.","[{""submissionId"":20190000449,""id"":""096e81cd0e2b4c2cbce66098bd141724"",""publicationDate"":""2015-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190000449,""name"":""NASA Ames Research Center"",""location"":""Moffett Field, CA, United States"",""id"":""af4a1d62b71040309f83652678fb784f""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190000449,""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Ames Research Center"",""location"":""Moffett Field, CA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""416808edf84c44fd96f8ba76e372c3c4"",""id"":""c0b22eb79cc14b22bd68bf69416a0af0""}],""name"":""Seminar at ARC Summer Series"",""location"":""Moffett Field, CA"",""id"":""416808edf84c44fd96f8ba76e372c3c4"",""startDate"":""2015-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 904211.01.30.41""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190000449
20205009095,POSTER,Spaceflight Biospecimen and Data Sharing in Support of Science Discovery and Exploration,"[""Ryan T. Scott"",""Alison J French"",""Alan E. Wood"",""Elizabeth Keller"",""Danielle Lopez"",""Martha Del Alto""]","For decades, NASA and international partners have conducted biological experiments in space to understand effects of spaceflight and address potential hazards. To enable spaceflight back to the Moon, and then to Mars and beyond, it is imperative to further understand basic science and health risks associated with spaceflight, along with developing countermeasures. The sending of experiments and organisms into space is a costly endeavor. To maximize scientific return, sharing with the scientific community both space-flown biospecimens and data from completed experiments is essential. New fundamental, applied, and bioinformatic science insights can be gained from specimen and data sharing efforts. Data reuse enables spaceflight health risk modeling, analyzing adverse outcomes across spaceflight hazards, and deep space autonomous support for the flight medical officer. 

Space-flown biospecimens not required by mission Principal Investigators are regularly archived and made available for scientific request. The largest biorepository of these samples are found within NASA’s Institutional Scientific Collection at Ames Research Center (ISC-ARC), which stores over 32,000 specimens mostly from Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) missions, but also some ground-based analog samples. The Ames Life Sciences Data Archive manages the ISC-ARC. Tissues are predominantly from mice and rats, though samples are also available from bacteria and quail. Only a handful of other similar collections exist worldwide. Rodent biospecimens exposed to simulated space radiation at Brookhaven National Laboratory are archived under the purview of NASA HRP Space Radiation Element. Microbial collection and analyses from 20 years of routine environmental monitoring of air, surfaces, and water systems of the ISS were performed to ensure a safe environment for astronauts. Samples from the ISC-ARC, space radiation and microbial collections are searchable and requestable through the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). Decades of planetary protection microbial isolates derived from spacecraft bioburden are archived in JPL’s microbial collection. Rodent biospecimens from spaceflight investigations conducted by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) are archived and available at the JAXA Biorepository at Tsukuba Space Center. The Russian Institute of Biomedical Problems also has a collection of animal, microbial, cellular, and fungi available for research from ground analog experiments. 

Several data repositories exist for scientists to utilize. The LSDA is the primary NASA source of life sciences research data and information. It contains decades of spaceflight and ground-analog research involving human, microbial, cellular, plant, and animal subjects. Data is collected from NASA-funded investigations through the Human Research Program and the Space Biology Program. The NASA Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health collects and grants access to clinical and occupational health monitoring data from astronauts, with a list and description of data collected available for request through the LSDA. NASA GeneLab at ARC collects genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from any species. It is a repository and platform for collaborative open-science bioinformatic approaches. JAXA is establishing an ‘omics-based repository in collaboration with the Tohoku Medical Megabank (ToMMo), called the JAXA-ToMMo Integrated Biobank for Space Life Science. Overall, the sharing of these biospecimen and data resources can assist researchers worldwide in understanding spaceflight effects on biology, along with enabling next generation data science applications for space exploration platforms.

Scott"",""Lauren Marie Sanders"",""Danielle Kristine Lopez"",""Samrawit Getachew Gebre"",""Sylvain V Costes""]","The next era in human space exploration is rapidly approaching and will require the use of
countermeasures to deep space health hazards. The development of countermeasures (or, the re-purposing of existing agents) will be highly dependent on our understanding of basic biological responses to space stressors (e.g. ionizing radiation, altered gravitational fields, altered day-night cycles, confinement, isolation, hostile-closed environments, distance-duration from Earth, exposure to celestial regolith, etc.). The fast-growing array of space biological data, which in the past was simply archived after minimal analysis, holds great potential if it can be reorganized and formatted for data re-analysis and re-use via Open Science. Organizing the data for such analysis is a challenge because of its diverse nature (molecular, cellular, tissue, imaging, whole organism and behavior).

To address the challenges posed by gaining new knowledge from a vast and diverse amount of biological, health and environmental data in space, the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR - osdr.nasa.gov/bio) plays a crucial role in curating and openly publishing biological data from space-related experiments. Its design incorporates successes and lessons from NASA GeneLab, encompassing not only high-throughput sequencing data but also physiological, phenotypic, and telemetry data. The OSDR makes space biological data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable), and facilitates effective data ingestion, dissemination, and Open Science collaborations.

In an effort to understand the mechanisms of these changes, cell cultures of cartilage, bone and muscle have been subjected to spaceflight to study the microgravity effects on differentiated cells. However it now seems possible that the cell differentiation process itself may be the event(s) most affected by spaceflight. For example, osteoblast-like cells have been shown to have reduced cellular activity in microgravity due to an underdifferentiated state (Carmeliet, et al, 1997). And reduced human lymphocyte growth in spaceflight was related to increased apoptosis (Lewis, et al, 1998). Which brings us to the question of whether reduced cellular activity in space is due to an effect on the differentiated cell, an effect on the cell cycle and cell proliferation, or an effect on cell death. This question has not been specifically addressed on previous flights and was the question behind die present study.","[{""submissionId"":20000021584,""id"":""e292221113664ae9bd6c7e20f9f1fe2a"",""publicationDate"":""2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG2-1184""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000021584

The HRP has developed an evidence report for each of the risks. Most evidence reports are a brief review article describing the evidence related to a specified risk, written at a level appropriate for the scientifically educated, non‐specialist reader. Each evidence report captured the current state of knowledge from both research and operations. Two limitations of the evidence reports have become apparent: 1) they are updated infrequently and 2) they do not take full advantage of the expertise available in other space agencies and in related fields of terrestrial research. Therefore, the HRP is experimenting with the use of Wikipedia articles as a repository for evidence. Wikipedia's accessibility to the international space flight community and researchers in related terrestrial fields creates the opportunity to generate a more timely and comprehensive evidence base. Initial Wikipedia articles were populated for seven risks using a subset of the information in the HRP‐approved evidence reports: Fatigue and Sleep Loss, Treating An Ill or Injured Crew Member, Radiation Carcinogenesis, Visual Impairment and Intracranial Pressure, Renal Stone Formation, Team Cohesion, and Intervertebral Disc Damage. Since the initial articles were created, there have been additions to these Wikipedia articles, including content from sources outside the HRP, and editorial changes to the pages. We will report on the nature of the contributions made after the initial articles were created, the comprehensiveness of the resulting Wikipedia articles, and the effort required to maintain quality control of the content.

Over the past 50 years, many microorganisms have displayed unexpected responses relevant to infectious disease when grown in microgravity and microgravity analogue environments, including changes in stress resistance, biofilm production, antibiotic sensitivity, final cell concentration, gene expression, enhanced host-pathogen interaction, and virulence. In parallel, astronaut studies have characterized a persistent spaceflight-induced dysregulation of the human immune system; consisting of altered leukocyte distribution, reductions in T and NK cell function, altered cytokine profiles, and reactivation of latent herpesviruses. Further, astronauts have some degree of clinical incidence, primarily infectious disease episodes and atopic dermatitis. The impact of the microgravity environment on host-pathogen interactions and potential for clinical disease remains understudied and poorly characterized.
SPECIFIC AIMS
In this study, the following Specific Aims are being investigated, using the microbial pathogens, Salmonella enterica Enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC).
Aim 1: Characterize the effect of spaceflight analogue culture on microbial pathogenesis-related stress responses and in vitro host-pathogen interactions. Analyses include microbial stress responses as well as colonization and viability following pathogen challenge of three-dimensional (3-D) tissue co-culture models containing immune cells. We specifically selected obligate and opportunistic pathogens that are medically important and have been or are likely to be found aboard spacecraft.
Aim 2: Characterize the effect of spaceflight analogue culture on the virulence potential of pathogenic microorganisms. Virulence will be assessed using a mouse model of infection.
SIGNIFICANCE
The goal of this study is to use spaceflight analogue conditions to gain insight into the breadth of medically-significant International Space Station microorganisms that have altered virulence and the impact of those changes on the immune response of the host. This information will provide critical understanding into the impact of microgravity on potential alterations in microbial virulence and associated infectious disease risk to crew health during spaceflight missions.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220014866,""endDate"":""2023-02-09T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""08525fe13113481ab65b15df7be22ede"",""id"":""34f9fe11f02c42d186beaf711ed5cbcd""}],""name"":""NASA's 2023 Human Research Program Investigator’s Workshop "",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""08525fe13113481ab65b15df7be22ede"",""startDate"":""2023-02-07T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""609524.07.02.03.02""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20230000766,""title"":""Spaceflight-Induced Changes in Microbial Virulence and the Impact to the Host Immune Response""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220014866

This becomes a greater imperative as we prepare for interplanetary expeditions involving humans who will be subjected to long transit periods in microgravity as they travel to a distant planet such as Mars, embark and live on the planet's surface for an extended time, and finally, return to the 1 g environment of Earth. We need to know, more definitively, what the human health, safety, and performance risks are, and how to prevent or counteract them throughout all phases of a long duration mission. The Johnson Space Center's Space and Life Sciences Directorate along with the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) have been engaged in a strategic planning effort that identifies the most critical risks confronting humans who will venture forth on such missions and the types of research and technology efforts required to mitigate and otherwise reduce the probability and/or severity of those risks. This paper describes the unique approach used to define, assess and prioritize the risks and presents the results of the assessment with an emphasis on the research and technology priorities that will help us to meet the challenge of long duration human spaceflight missions.","[{""submissionId"":20100033409,""id"":""b0d16a878f2145e381384a8a4f24d3be"",""publicationDate"":""2000-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20100033409,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""3a58543e8dad4e1eae6a6a89f02d3f8d"",""id"":""ec2feb0068b1488aa78a6329a584d191""}],""name"":""Space Technology and Applications International Forum 2000 (Biomedical Research on the International Space Station)"",""location"":""Albuquerque, NM"",""id"":""3a58543e8dad4e1eae6a6a89f02d3f8d"",""startDate"":""2000-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""UPN 111-50""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100033409

The Mir experience provided the opportunity to examine the use and potential effectiveness of tools and procedures to support the behavioral health of the crew. The experience of NASA has shown that on-orbit performance can be better maintained if behavioral health, sleep, and circadian issues are effectively monitored and properly addressed. For example, schedules can be tailored based upon fatigue level of crews and other behavioral and cognitive indicators to maximize performance. Previous research and experience with long duration missions has resulted in the development and upgrade of tools used to monitor fatigue, stress, cognitive function, and behavioral health. Self-assessment and objective tools such as the Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool have been developed and refined to effectively address behavioral medicine countermeasures in space.","[{""submissionId"":20000085963,""id"":""995567ea46004631bdd7292761854699"",""publicationDate"":""2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000085963

Previous research utilizing combined hindlimb unloading and irradiation to simulate spaceflight effects found that a dried plum diet can mitigate adverse effects of simulated spaceflight on skeletal health. Though the mechanism is not fully understood we believe this protective effect is due to its high antioxidant capacity and polyphenolic content. This study seeks to extend these findings to investigate if dried plum is an effective countermeasure in other tissues relating to aging and neurotoxicity. Male C57BL/6 J mice were assigned to one of eight groups (n = 10/group) and were fed either a controlled diet or dried plum diet, underwent normal loading or hindlimb unloading as well as exposure 2 Gy gamma radiation or sham exposure. At the end of the experiment, mice were euthanized, and RNA was extracted from brain and bone marrow tissue and PCR was employed to analyze significant changes in gene expression profiles. Analysis of five house-keeping genes revealed genes B2M (neurotoxicity) and GUSB (aging) to be the most stable genes across all treatments and were used to find the fold change within our genes of interest. Through this, and analysis via ANOVA, we were able to identify genes with significant altered expression levels within brain and bone marrow tissues related to neurotoxicity and aging. Considering previous research, we hypothesize that the dried plum diet’s antioxidative properties ameliorated the oxidative stress from irradiation and microgravity via altered levels of gene expression. Identified expression changes will provide insights into molecular mechanisms behind the observed protective effects. These findings present potential avenues for future interventions to alleviate negative impacts of spaceflight on astronaut health.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230011423,""endDate"":""2023-11-18T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""227ff6242dfa409a877a4e918583f086"",""id"":""5a9c86e068704150ac6c8b52ad47be71""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) "",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""227ff6242dfa409a877a4e918583f086"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2023-meeting/ "",""startDate"":""2023-11-14T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""533001.07.02.01.02.01""]",undefined,"[""Space Radiation"",""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230011423

Plants are essential to human sustenance, making it important to understand how spaceflight affects plant health. We used differential gene expression analysis to examine GLDS-251 (RNAseq analysis of the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to fractional gravity under blue-light stimulation during spaceflight) from NASA’s GeneLab data repository and found downregulation of ERF2 and ERF104, transcription factors of the ethylene response factor families, that integrate hormonal pathways involved in abiotic stress responses. Downregulation of ERF2 and ERF104 during spaceflight may indicate a dysregulation of the ethylene signaling pathway. Our hypothesis is that altered gravity downregulates the expression of ERF2 and ERF104 in Arabidopsis thaliana, altering the ethylene signaling pathway and affecting the electron transport chain and light-dependent reactions in chloroplast thylakoids. To test this hypothesis, we propose to grow A. thaliana seedlings (wild-type and mutant/knockout of ERF2 and ERF104) in altered gravity conditions to determine the effects on the expression of ERF2, ERF104, and photosynthesis.

L."",""Van Baalen, M."",""Rossi, M."",""Riccio, G."",""Romero, E."",""Francisco, D.""]","Understanding the kinds of evidence available and using the best evidence to answer a question is critical to evidenced-based decision-making, and it requires synthesis of evidence from a variety of sources. Categorization of human system risks in spaceflight, in particular, focuses on how well the integration and interpretation of all available evidence informs the risk statement that describes the relationship between spaceflight hazards and an outcome of interest. A mature understanding and categorization of these risks requires: 1) sufficient characterization of risk, 2) sufficient knowledge to determine an acceptable level of risk (i.e., a standard), 3) development of mitigations to meet the acceptable level of risk, and 4) identification of factors affecting generalizability of the evidence to different design reference missions. In the medical research community, evidence is often ranked by increasing confidence in findings gleaned from observational and experimental research (e.g., ""levels of evidence""). However, an approach based solely on aspects of experimental design is problematic in assessing human system risks for spaceflight. For spaceflight, the unique challenges and opportunities include: (1) The independent variables in most evidence are the hazards of spaceflight, such as space radiation or low gravity, which cannot be entirely duplicated in terrestrial (Earth-based) analogs, (2) Evidence is drawn from multiple sources including medical and mission operations, Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health (LSAH), spaceflight research (LSDA), and relevant environmental & terrestrial databases, (3) Risk metrics based primarily on LSAH data are typically derived from available prevalence or incidence data, which may limit rigorous interpretation, (4) The timeframe for obtaining adequate spaceflight sample size (n) is very long, given the small population, (5) Randomized controlled trials are unattainable in spaceflight, (6) Collection of personal and environmental data on the astronaut population may create opportunities for advanced analytics and human-environment modeling that goes beyond that achieved in isolated experimental designs; and (7) Translation of relevant research to operations is a complex, transdisciplinary enterprise in which the approach must apply across the physical, biological, behavioral, and social sciences. The approach to synthesizing evidence must address both source and fidelity of data, and reflect the most general attributes of quality of evidence in science and engineering: reliability and validity. The authors are developing a two-factor approach which includes the various kinds of evidence required to understand risks and for the integrated interpretation of all evidence that is essential to develop standards and countermeasures. A unified framework for aggregating and assessing different kinds of evidence provides a consistent, traceable, evidence-based decision-making process to translate research to operations in an environment where engineers, scientists, physicians, and managers all engage in analyzing the trade space of vehicle design, standards, requirements and solutions for spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":20150021486,""id"":""0ffc9def60744a96b7c1b56e93c2e49b"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150021486,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""5e263e09d52345b492a05638c1dcf696"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst.

Notably, the classic foodborne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium displayed increased virulence in animals when cultured in either the spaceflight analogue or true spaceflight environment. Recently, Serratia marcescens also was shown to increase virulence when cultured in the spaceflight environment. In parallel, astronaut studies have characterized a persistent spaceflight-induced dysregulation of the human immune system at multiple levels, which suggests an increased risk of infectious diseases.  Moreover, astronauts have some degree of clinical infectious disease incidence. However, the contribution of the microgravity environment on host-pathogen interactions and potential for clinical disease remains understudied and poorly characterized. 

The goal of this study is to gain insight into the breadth of other medically significant microbial pathogens that may exhibit altered virulence and pathogenesis-related responses when cultured in spaceflight analogue conditions. Specifically, we are characterizing the effect of spaceflight analogue culture (Low Shear Modeled Microgravity/LSMMG) on microbial pathogenesis-related stress responses, in vitro host-pathogen interactions, gene expression, and virulence potential in animals using five important model bacterial pathogens, Salmonella enterica Enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli.

The term ""standard measures"" is defined as a set of core measurements, including physiological, biochemical, psychosocial, cognitive, and functional, that are reliable, valid, and accepted in terrestrial science, are associated with a specific and measurable outcome known to occur as a consequence of spaceflight, that will be collected in a standardized fashion from all (or most) crewmembers. While such measures might be used to define standards of health and performance or readiness for flight, the prime intent in their collection is to allow longitudinal analysis of multiple parameters in order to answer a variety of operational, occupational, and research-based questions. These questions are generally at a high level, and the approach for this project is to populate the standard measures database with the smallest set of data necessary to indicate further detailed research is required. Also included as standard measures are parameters that are not outcome-based in and of-themselves, but provide ancillary information that supports interpretation of the outcome measures, e.g., nutritional assessment, vehicle environmental parameters, crew debriefs, etc. The project's main aim is to ensure that an optimized minimal set of measures is consistently captured from all ISS crewmembers until the end of Station in order to characterize the human in space. -This allows the HRP to identify, establish, and evaluate a common set of measures for use in spaceflight and analog research to: develop baselines, systematically characterize risk likelihood and consequences, and assess effectiveness of countermeasures that work for behavioral health and performance risk factors. -By standardizing the battery of measures on all crewmembers, it will allow the HRP to evaluate countermeasures that work for one physiological system and ensure another system is not negatively affected. -These measures, named ""Standard Measures,"" will serve as a data repository and be available to other studies under data sharing agreements.","[{""submissionId"":20170005421,""id"":""26e2b11c105449b8a3a2ded88466940c"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20170005421,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""877b16af7a0b4c80aabbf8d703ce6d52"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""European Space Agency.

An understanding of spaceflight-related changes provides important information about human adaptive plasticity and facilitates future space travel. In the current study, we evaluated how brain activations associated with vestibular stimulation and dual tasking change as a function of spaceflight. Five crewmembers were included in this study. The durations of their spaceflight missions ranged from 3 months to 7 months. All of them completed at least two preflight assessments and at least one postflight assessment. The preflight sessions occurred, on average, about 198 days and 51 days before launch; the first postflight sessions were scheduled 5 days after return. Functional MRI was acquired during vestibular stimulation and dual tasking, at each session. Vestibular stimulation was administered via skull taps delivered by a pneumatic tactile pulse system placed over the lateral cheekbones. The magnitude of brain activations for vestibular stimulation increased with spaceflight relative to the preflight levels, in frontal areas and the precuneus. In addition, longer flight duration was associated with greater preflight-to-postflight increases in vestibular activation in frontal regions. Functional MRI for finger tapping was acquired during both single-task (finger tapping only) and dual-task (simultaneously performing finger tapping and a secondary counting task) conditions. Preflight-to-post-spaceflight decreases in brain activations for dual tasking were observed in the right postcentral cortex. An association between flight duration and amplitude of flight-related change in activations for dual tasking was observed in the parietal cortex. The spaceflight-related increase in vestibular brain activations suggests that after a long-term spaceflight, more neural resources are required to process vestibular input.","[{""submissionId"":20170003871,""id"":""0ea4e2fad4c748ecbf77e4187514949e"",""publicationDate"":""2017-05-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Ireland"",""submissionId"":20170003871,""endDate"":""2017-05-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""c562187f069d4f86b93a208c4fa752dd"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Society of Neural Control of Movement"",""location"":""Victoria, British Columbia, Canada""}},""meetingId"":""d7bd5e9276774f8795d5d97be15973d6"",""id"":""566d2965478f4f5385adaad873e0d6e4""}],""name"":""Neural Control of Movement Meeting"",""location"":""Dublin"",""id"":""d7bd5e9276774f8795d5d97be15973d6"",""startDate"":""2017-05-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170003871

The difference between spaceflight proven capabilities and those needed for future exploration architectures is defined as a capability gap.  Capability gaps are not technology specific.  Each capability gap is approachable with a wide array of technologies that have unique benefits and challenges.  Determining what a capability’s relevant and distinguishing key performance parameters (KPPs) are for a mission is critical.  Mass, power, and volume are always constrained and important, but defining these in a way normalized by performance is challenging.  Additionally, KPP definition for reliability, dormancy, and integration needs are very important and still evolving. This paper provides the approach of the Environmental Control and Life Support – Crew Health and Performance (ECLSS-CHP) System Capability Leadership Team (SCLT) has used to define gaps and KPPs in support of the NASA’s Capabilities Integration Team data call objectives.  The nine ECLSS-CHP capability areas are decomposed to capabilities with ~76 gaps and supported with KPPs. Rather than defining very detailed gaps, ECLSS-CHP defines high-level gaps to be technology agnostic.  Within a gap, detailed KPPs are defined to both compare technologies and measure progress within a technology over time.  Ideally, KPPs are clearly defined, widely communicated both internally and externally, and provide a common nomenclature to describe the state of the art and the degree of improvement required for exploration missions.  KPPs help define when the gap is closed, and the core mission objectives can be accomplished.  Further technology improvements to enhance the capability, as measured by improved KPPs, must then be weighed against investments in open capability gaps that prevent NASA from achieving its exploration missions.  It is uncommon that a technology maturation to improve all the relevant KPPs simultaneously but using KPPs is a critical technology investment decision making component.  In addition to traditional technology selections, KPPs are informing how investments in ground testing prior to and in parallel with ISS technology demonstrations are required to improve reliability KPPs.  The collection of all major technology activities within a capability area are captured on technology roadmaps to communicate how diverse program activities are coordinated to close gaps and infuse into exploration mission needs. A selection of ECLSS-CHP gaps and KPPs and their formulation, current state, and how they inform capability roadmap planning are discussed.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20210023867,""endDate"":""2022-07-14T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Conference of Environmental Systems, Inc""}},""meetingId"":""a90c8355db6441969b64b25361eb023f"",""id"":""934a866b2e0444e79cfdd14918a3d855""}],""name"":""51st International Conference of Environmental Systems (ICES)"",""location"":""Saint Paul, MN"",""id"":""a90c8355db6441969b64b25361eb023f"",""url"":""https://www.ices.space/"",""startDate"":""2022-07-10T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""\t668034.01.02.04""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210023867

From this work we demonstrated that this miRNA signature impacted the overall biology and health with both the microgravity and space radiation components of the space environment. We showed that this miRNA signature can be an optimal biomarker for health risk and also has potential to be utilized as a countermeasure to mitigate the damage caused by the space environment by utilizing a human 3D microvascular tissue model. By applying a novel self-delivery system to target 3 miRNAs (i.e. antagomirs) from our spaceflight miRNA signature impacting cardiovascular health risks, we were able to completely mitigate damage caused by exposure to simulated Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) irradiation. Here we further expand on the countermeasure experiments to uncover the specific novel biology involved with this countermeasure and in vivo experiments that demonstrates that these antagomirs rescue damage caused to certain organs due to both microgravity and space radiation. Specifically, the miRNAs rescued damage to the heart and immune suppression that occurred in addition to other key biology. In addition, we have also observed with the 3D microvascular tissue model improved DNA double strand break repair machinery which can also contribute to improved recovery and protection against damage caused by space radiation.

Investigating these changes is essential for understanding the long-term effects of spaceflight on human physiology to ensure crew health. Ground-based analogs provide an efficient method to evaluate alterations induced by chronic spaceflight on a larger scale. This study focuses on CNS changes in response to hypergravity (HG) and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels via a ground-based analog using the well-established model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. We hypothesize behavior and physiological changes immediately post exposure to HG+CO<sub>2</sub>, along with chronic effects up to 25 days post-exposure. Adult male and female flies were exposed to varying gravity loads (1g, 1.2g, and 3g) and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels (~4000 ppm, mimicking CO<sub>2</sub> levels on the ISS) for 15 days and were assessed immediately and at 5-, 10-, and 25-days post-exposure, mirroring astronauts’ post-return profiling. The flies were assessed for neurobehavioral changes, including longevity and negative geotaxis; brain morphological changes, such as dopaminergic neuron count, apoptosis, and glial cell density; and bioenergetic changes in the brain, including mitochondrial abundance and membrane potential. Longevity remained unchanged under hypergravity, even with the addition of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> as a stressor. However, despite the stable lifespan, quality of life appeared to be affected, as shown by negative geotaxis and neuroanatomical changes. Negative geotaxis testing revealed a reduction in motor ability at R0 across all conditions, which correlated with a decrease in dopaminergic (DA) neuron count. Additional observations suggested further systemic alterations, including a decrease in glial cell count, an increase in apoptosis, and notable bioenergetic changes. Collectively, these findings contribute to our understanding of the long-term effects of spaceflight on the CNS.",[],"[{""country"":""PR"",""submissionId"":20240014508,""endDate"":""2024-12-07T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d993e7e0320146a6b5667846b006bd1c"",""id"":""238d77f9f4a74029a680ce621cc72b46""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) "",""location"":""San Juan"",""id"":""d993e7e0320146a6b5667846b006bd1c"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/asgsr-2024-puerto-rico/"",""startDate"":""2024-12-03T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""21-21SBAS_2-0035""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240014508

M. Smith"",""M. Bishop"",""M. Young""]","Background: NASA’s planned space exploration missions will require astronauts to safely perform extravehicular activity (EVA) and to safely egress vehicles in a variety of landing scenarios. Prolonged exposure to spaceflight can diminish tolerance for physical activity, decrease cardiovascular and sensorimotor function, and cause loss of bone mineral density, and reduced muscle mass and strength. Although exercise can mitigate these spaceflight-induced physiological decrements, little is known regarding the time-course of changes in muscle and aerobic performance during spaceflight. Furthermore, these exercise countermeasures are not fully protective. For example, maximal aerobic capacity (VO2pk), lower body muscle cross-sectional area, and strength decrease by about 10% to 15% after short- (~ 14 days) and long-duration (~ 6 months) missions on the International Space Station (ISS). Future space missions that are longer in duration and further from Earth will employ exploration vehicles that will have exercise hardware with less robust and more constrained exercise capabilities than of those available on the ISS. Thus, countermeasures will need to be optimized to protect crew health and performance on exploration-class missions that will last up to 3 years. This will require a more detailed understanding of the dynamic effects of spaceflight on human health and performance, and the ability of exercise to protect against this deconditioning, and the interaction of exercise with interrelated factors like nutrition, sleep, and environmental conditions. 

Methods: We will use standardized research and medical testing protocols previously validated in 1-G and 0-G to quantify the time course and the inter-individual variability of changes in physical performance, including cardiorespiratory fitness, and  muscle strength, and endurance, before, during and after spaceflight missions lasting 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Additionally, we will use an extrapolation model to predict changes associated with 2–3-year exploration missions. Additionally, we will monitor in-flight exercise, nutrition, and sleep using in-flight assessment tools. 

Significance: Our testing protocols will provide valuable information for determining time course of change and the interindividual variability of spaceflight-induced deconditioning of aerobic capacity and muscle strength and endurance over the course of spaceflight missions up to and beyond 1 year. This information will be vital to assess whether humans can be physically ready for deep space exploration, such as on a mission to Mars, using current technology, or if additional mitigation strategies are necessary.

VIIP is defined primarily by visual acuity deficits and anatomical changes to eye structures (e.g. optic disc edema, choroidal folds, and globe flattening) and is hypothesized to be related to elevated intracranial pressure secondary to a cephalad fluid shift. However, ocular symptoms have not been replicated in subjects completing prolonged bed rest, a well-accepted spaceflight analog. Altered vascular compliance along with spaceflight factors such as diet, radiation exposure, or environmental factors may cause alterations in the cardiovascular system that contribute to the manifestation of ocular changes. Loss of visual acuity could be a significant threat to crew health and performance during and after an exploration mission and may have implications for years post-flight. The overall objective of this project is to determine if spaceflight alters vascular compliance and whether such an adaptation is related to the incidence of VIIP. This objective will be met by completing three separate but related projects.","[{""submissionId"":20160013639,""id"":""b3b254adc9ed47769355335df521b68e"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160013639,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""50bcc72dec1d47a79459da021e5b0917""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160013639,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""0a686fc14b2b4b348d981df05212702a"",""id"":""cf975d11f0a2480480ccdc7ff4b4df2b""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2017)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""0a686fc14b2b4b348d981df05212702a"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160013639

Prolonged exposure to spaceflight can diminish tolerance for physical activity, decrease cardiovascular and sensorimotor function, cause loss of bone mineral density, as well as reduced muscle mass and strength. Although exercise can mitigate these spaceflight-induced physiological decrements, little is known regarding the time-course of changes in muscle and aerobic performance during spaceflight. Furthermore, these exercise countermeasures are not fully protective. For example, maximal aerobic capacity (VO2pk), lower body muscle cross-sectional area, and strength decrease by about 10% to 15% after short- (≈14 days) and long-duration (≈6 months) missions on the International Space Station (ISS). Future space missions longer in duration and further from Earth will employ exploration vehicles that will have exercise hardware with less robust and more constrained exercise capabilities than of those available on the ISS. Thus, countermeasures will need to be optimized to protect crew health and performance on exploration-class missions lasting up to 3 years. This requires a more detailed understanding of the dynamic effects of spaceflight on human health and performance, the ability of exercise to protect against this deconditioning, and the interaction of exercise with interrelated factors like nutrition, sleep, and environmental conditions. 

Methods: We will use standardized research and medical testing protocols previously validated in 1g and microgravity to quantify the time course and the inter-individual variability of changes in physical performance, including cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength and endurance, before, during, and after spaceflight missions lasting 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Additionally, we will use an extrapolation model to predict changes associated with multi-year exploration missions. Additionally, we will monitor in-flight exercise, nutrition, and sleep using in-flight assessment tools.

Missing data, especially if missing in a non-random fashion, could be a significant challenge to the success and validity of ongoing occupational surveillance and research. Astronaut occupational health data have been collected since 1959 in various formats and as part of several flight programs. As a result of changing methodologies over this span, epidemiologists in the NASA Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health (LSAH) project regularly compile data sets with important exposure or outcome data missing. METHODS: NASA medical records of astronauts participating in voluntary annual LSAH examinations were reviewed and compiled to develop Individual Exposure Profiles (IEP) for each astronaut. These data were supplemented by an interview. If the interview yielded medically relevant information absent from the medical record, that information was considered an update. The IEPs were analyzed to identify trends regarding the characteristics of astronauts who provided updates and what kinds of information were consistently being updated. RESULTS: To date, 190 astronauts have participated in the IEP project. Medical information was updated for 119 individuals during these interviews. The astronauts' likelihood of updating their record upon interview was not significantly related to their spaceflight experience, era of active spaceflight, or duration of longest spaceflight. The most commonly updated categories of medical information were issues encountered during spaceflights, including CO2 symptoms, vision changes, back pain, headaches, and space motion sickness. DISCUSSION: The most commonly updated categories correspond to areas where LSAH has ongoing analysis efforts and therefore do not appear to have been reported at random. This presentation will address identification of missing astronaut health data and trends, forward work identified by the IEP project and how this information may be used for future LSAH data gap analyses.","[{""submissionId"":20180003428,""id"":""e0879a9d776f49ca98e183c299bf50b8"",""publicationDate"":""2018-05-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20180003428,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States"",""id"":""f492ae56115747c1871669468203bdbf""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180003428,""endDate"":""2018-05-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""77bb89dcb206409fadb510a6890c7971"",""id"":""faded05ff68d4e5888be231defc56115""}],""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association Annual Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""Dallas, TX"",""id"":""77bb89dcb206409fadb510a6890c7971"",""startDate"":""2018-05-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180003428

Data collected under the Spaceflight Standard Measures project include assessments of sleep/wake cycles, cognition, immune status and function, general blood and urine chemistry (urine is collected only before flight and after landing), microbiome composition (gastrointestinal tract, saliva, and body surface), cardiovascular structure and function (carotid intima-media thickness, orthostatic responses),  sensorimotor function, sleep quality, and team processes. Data is  collected once or twice before the flight (180 and 90 days before launch), twice during the 6-month missions (flight day 30 and 30 days before return to Earth) with the exception of actigraphy, which is recorded during two-week periods before, during, and after the mission. In this presentation, we will review the data collected to date on 31 ISS crewmembers. These data are placed in the NASA Life Sciences Portal (NLSP) and are available for occupational surveillance (using non-identifiable data), Institutional Review Board-approved data sharing requests, and retrospective data requests. This data repository enables high-level monitoring of the effectiveness of countermeasures and meaningful interpretation of health and performance outcomes for various mission durations. The knowledge gained from this project informs and supports future hypothesis-driven research that will enable the success of planetary missions.

20140010564,ABSTRACT,NASA's Approach to Critical Risks for Extended Human Space Flight,"[""Shelhamer, Mark""]","Planetary Robotic and Human Spaceflight Exploration Humans are exposed to a great variety of hazards in the space environment. These include the effects of weightlessness, radiation, isolation and confinement, altered day-night cycles, and others. These inherent hazards have both physiological and behavioral consequences. The adaptive capabilities of humans in these situations is remarkable, and often exceed our expectations. However, the demanding environment and challenging operational pace can push some of these adaptive processes to their limits. The NASA Human Research Program (HRP) is tasked with mitigating the most serious of these effects on human health, safety, and performance, in long-duration space flight. This can involve the development and deployment of physiological countermeasures, better understanding of the physiological alterations and avoidance of exacerbating situations, inputs to the design of future spacecraft to minimize risks, and in some cases the awareness that some level of risk might have to be accepted based on the resulting consequences and their likelihood. HRP has identified a few areas that are of special concern due to their severity, lack of understanding of underlying causes, or potential for negative impact on health or performance. Some of these areas are visual impairment possibly due to increased intracranial pressure, behavioral and performance problems due to sleep deficits and isolation, and acute and chronic effects of radiation. These problems can, if not addressed, be expected to increase on longer and more distant missions. The evidence from spaceflight, laboratory, and analog studies that supports the selection of the most critical risks will be discussed. Current and planned research programs that address these risks, and their anticipated outcomes, will also be described.","[{""submissionId"":20140010564,""id"":""afb7f02b85f44f3f8dd39609efb7674d"",""publicationDate"":""2014-01-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140010564,""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Paris, France"",""id"":""74b4d7feec6f4c36a7cdc7cd0414f690""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140010564,""endDate"":""2014-01-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""7149ae6588854b63be27bc3f9e4c0257"",""id"":""3d5f63c1206747128c440bee8d622707""}],""name"":""IAA Space Exploration Conference: Planetary Robotic and Human Spaceflight Exploration"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""7149ae6588854b63be27bc3f9e4c0257"",""startDate"":""2014-01-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140010564

Previous research utilizing combined hindlimb unloading and irradiation to simulate spaceflight effects found that a dried plum diet can mitigate adverse effects of simulated spaceflight on skeletal health. Though the mechanism is not fully understood we believe this protective effect is due to its high antioxidant capacity and polyphenolic content. This study seeks to extend these findings to investigate if dried plum is an effective countermeasure in other tissues relating to aging and neurotoxicity. Male C57BL/6 J mice were assigned to one of eight groups (n = 10/group) and were fed either a controlled diet or dried plum diet, underwent normal loading or hindlimb unloading as well as exposure 2 Gy gamma radiation or sham exposure. At the end of the experiment, mice were euthanized, and RNA was extracted from brain and bone marrow tissue and PCR was employed to analyze significant changes in gene expression profiles. Analysis of five house-keeping genes revealed genes B2M (neurotoxicity) and GUSB (aging) to be the most stable genes across all treatments and were used to find the fold change within our genes of interest. Through this, and analysis via ANOVA, we were able to identify genes with significant altered expression levels within brain and bone marrow tissues related to neurotoxicity and aging. Considering previous research, we hypothesize that the dried plum diet’s antioxidative properties ameliorated the oxidative stress from irradiation and microgravity via altered levels of gene expression. Identified expression changes will provide insights into molecular mechanisms behind the observed protective effects. These findings present potential avenues for future interventions to alleviate negative impacts of spaceflight on astronaut health.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230015715,""endDate"":""2023-11-18T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6093d053c7b04dcc9c7688b3386697ac"",""id"":""5ac179b8ca144bd3bb72d303359813da""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) "",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""6093d053c7b04dcc9c7688b3386697ac"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2023-meeting/ "",""startDate"":""2023-11-14T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""533001.07.02.01.02.01""]",undefined,"[""Space Radiation"",""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230015715

K.""]","The NASA Decadal Survey (2011), Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New Era, emphasized the importance of expanding NASA life sciences research to long duration, rodent experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). To accomplish this objective, flight hardware, operations, and science capabilities supporting mouse studies in space were developed at NASA Ames Research Center. The first flight experiment carrying mice, Rodent Research Hardware and Operations Validation (Rodent Research-1), was launched on Sept 21, 2014 in an unmanned Dragon Capsule, SpaceX4, exposing the mice to a total of 37 days in space. Ground control groups were maintained in environmental chambers at Kennedy Space Center. Mouse health and behavior were monitored for the duration of the experiment via video streaming. Here we present behavioral analysis of two groups of five C57BL/6 female adult mice viewed via fixed camera views compared with identically housed Ground Controls. Flight (Flt) and Ground Control (GC) mice exhibited the same range of behaviors, including eating, drinking, exploratory behavior, self- and allo-grooming, and social interactions at similar or greater levels of occurrence. Mice propelled themselves freely and actively throughout the Habitat using their forelimbs to push off or by floating from one cage area to another, and they quickly learned to anchor themselves using tails and/or paws. Overall activity was greater in Flt as compared to GC mice, with spontaneous ambulatory behavior including the development of organized ‘circling’ or ‘race-tracking’ behavior that emerged within the first few days of flight and encompassed the primary dark cycle activity for the remainder of the experiment. We quantified the bout frequency, duration and rate of circling with respect to characteristic behaviors observed in the varying stages of the progressive development of circling: flipping utilizing two sides of the habitat, circling, multi-lap circling and group-circling. Once begun, mice did not regress to flipping behavior or other previous behavioral milestones for the remainder of flight. An overall upward trend in circling frequency, rate, duration, participation, and organization was observed over the course of the 37-day spaceflight experiment. In this presentation, we will summarize qualitative observations and quantitative comparisons of mice in microgravity and 1g conditions. Behavioral analyses provide important insights into the overall health and adaptation of mice to the space environment, and identify unique behaviors and social interactions to guide future habitat development and research on rodents in space.","[{""submissionId"":20160001706,""id"":""ed0e8e5edad3413385036e621e5c5cef"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160001706,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""85cdb4c685b44b4daedcf8f7cbbc1862""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160001706,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f8753b1f5948497e9f5afe11df765cfd"",""id"":""5c5653164f014e878cae019934eb8211""}],""name"":""2016 Human Research Program Investigators Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""f8753b1f5948497e9f5afe11df765cfd"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNX15AG98A"",""NNA14AB82C"",""NNX13AJ38A"",""NNX12AB08A""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160001706

Costes"",""Ahmed Abukmail"","" Erik L. Antonsen""]","Exposure to spaceflight poses risk to human health in complex ways. To help manage this risk, the Human Systems Risk Board (HSRB) at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) maintains a set of causal diagrams that attempt to explain how spaceflight hazards generate health risks and lead to adverse outcomes both in-mission, immediately post-mission, and over the long term. These causal risk diagrams are formulated as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and can function as knowledge graphs of connected risks and outcomes. These DAGs have proven useful for communication, and, through network analysis, have allowed for the identification of structurally important factors in the risk network. However, the utility these DAGs provide is directly proportional to their verisimilitude, making assessment of this trait using empirical data – whether from actual human spaceflight or various spaceflight analogue exposures and model organisms – a high priority. 

In this research we explore the use of machine learning algorithms to learn DAG structure from empirical data as a means of evaluating human-elicited DAG structures. To do so, we test several different graph structure-learning algorithms on data concerning changes in the bones of rats and mice after exposure to either spaceflight or a spaceflight analogue.

20250000516,PRESENTATION,LLMs and GenAI Tools to Depict Contributions of Human Systems to Spaceflight Tasks Execution,"[""Mona Matar"",""Henry Arthur"",""Hunter Rehm""]","Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated syntax analysis, offer substantial potential in automating complex processes, thereby saving time and human resources. This study explores the development of an LLM-driven model designed to analyze and categorize a diverse set of Mars mission tasks into 18 predefined Human System Task Categories (HSTCs) based on their textual descriptions.

As part of developing the Crew Health and Performance – Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CHP-PRA projects Performance Risk Model (PRisM) proof-of-concept, we established a framework to project performance scores from small-scale tests onto a preliminary list of Mars tasks. The foundation of our model was a comprehensive spreadsheet populated by NASA experts and clinicians, which detailed each Mars task alongside binary indicators of HSTC involvement. This dataset enabled the initial application of supervised ML, training and testing on existing HSTC labels.

The HSTCs were originally defined from a medical system perspective, focusing on task impairments due to deteriorated human health. To expand our model's scope to include categories impacting performance, we face the challenge of generating binary labels (0 or 1) for new categories without pre-existing data. We address this by employing Generative AI (GenAI) software to determine whether a given task involved a new category by asking, ""Does task A involve using category B?"" We validate our approach by comparing the GenAI's binary classifications with the expert-provided labels for existing HSTCs. Notably, we utilize Ollama [4], a locally hosted GenAI tool that does not require cloud access, thus safeguarding NASA's proprietary data from unauthorized exposure.

This study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging cutting-edge AI tools to advance research, paving the way for automation and rapid decision-making in space exploration.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20250000516,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""03cc9e841b2448329d2755cb93311a88"",""id"":""a771f9623cd24e3d951b9a24ea0d7aec""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""03cc9e841b2448329d2755cb93311a88"",""url"":""https://www.nasa.gov/hrp/iws-2025/"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""305041.01.02.10""]",undefined,"[""Cybernetics, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250000516

Previous studies have shown that exposure to small doses of high LET radiation (< 50 cGy) can lead to both short-term and long-term alterations in heart function, structure and underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we aim to identify the molecular signature associated with the cardiovascular response to simulated galactic cosmic radiation (5-ion GCR) alone or in combination with simulated weightlessness at time intervals relevant to mission length and recovery. Additionally, we aim to determine whether sex impacts cardiovascular responses to these spaceflight factors. Our overarching goal is to enhance our understanding of the cardiovascular risks associated with extended space missions and the clinical endpoints they suggest. We hypothesize that exposure to simulated space radiation leads to enduring alterations in the transcriptome, redox signaling and cytokine environment of cardiovascular tissue, some which have known links with reduced cardiovascular performance, aging, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Furthermore, we posit that simulated space radiation exposure in combination with simulated microgravity exacerbates cardiovascular deficits compared to single factor exposure. Female and male C57BL/6J mice, aged 23-24 weeks, were exposed to a single dose of 5, 15, or 50 cGy of 5-ion GCR, or sham-treated (0 cGy). Euthanasia was performed at 14 days and ~4 months post-irradiation. Hearts, aorta and blood plasma were collected shortly thereafter. RNA-sequencing of left ventricles at ~4 months post-GCR exposure revealed sex differences in the heart transcriptome with a few genes showing radiation-dependent changes in expression levels. Notably, some of the differentially expressed genes in 15 and 50 cGy GCR groups are known to play roles in the development of CVD. Analysis of protein levels of a subset of inflammatory cytokines in the heart indicated sex differences but no differences between sham and 50 cGy groups. Results also showed correlations among differentially expressed genes and a subset of inflammatory cytokines, with some correlations altered by GCR exposure. These findings suggest that GCR exposure can modify protein and gene networks linked to inflammation and CVD progression. In the aorta, telomere lengths were comparable across treatment groups sexes. Mitochondrial copy number is a biomarker for mitochondrial function with decreased copy numbers associated with cardiometabolic disease traits. Mitochondrial copy numbers of aorta also showed no sex nor dose differences. In a second study, mice underwent one week of simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading (HU) and then exposed to a single dose of 15 cGy of 5-ion GCR. HU was conducted for an additional two weeks following GCR exposure. Single factor exposure groups (HU or GCR only) also were included in the study. Euthanasia was then performed and the same tissues were collected. Protein levels of select inflammatory cytokines in the heart showed sex-dependent differences in expression. In the aorta, telomere lengths and mitochondrial copy number also showed sex differences. In summary, our results indicate differences between sexes in biomarkers related to cardiovascular health. Exposure to 5-ion GCR or HU, alone or in combination, did not result in changes in most of the cardiovascular biomarkers that were examined. However, in the heart, simulated space radiation at doses of 15 and 50 cGy led to long-term alterations in the expression levels of a small group of genes known to be associated with the progression of CVD. The long-term transcriptomic changes resulting from exposure to simulated space radiation should be carefully investigated to mitigate adverse cardiovascular events during and after deep space missions. Our results also highlight the importance of sex-specific strategies in monitoring and maintaining cardiovascular health during and after deep space missions.

Risks are ranked by likelihood and consequence. Intermediate causal relationships between risk contributing factors and countermeasures that link hazards to outcomes are described using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The DAGs are also useful for identifying common factors and countermeasures across the top 30 risks as well as communicating how astronaut exposure to spaceflight hazards leads to meaningful mission-level health and performance outcomes.  
  
One of the top risks tracked by the HSRB is The Risk of Adverse Outcomes Due to Inadequate Human-Systems Integration Architecture (HSIA). This risk captures the possibility that due to decreasing real-time ground support during missions beyond LEO, crew will be unable to adequately respond to unanticipated critical malfunctions or detect safety-critical procedural errors. The HSIA risk is ranked red (high) for Lunar surface and Mars missions due to the probability of Loss of Crew and Loss of Mission consequences. 
This paper describes the evidence that supports the HSIA risk ranking and presents the central narrative of the HSIA risk DAG-- i.e., anomaly detection, diagnosis, intervention, and task performance.

This presentation will provide an overview of the HFBP-EM program, describe its implementation across spaceflight analogs and the international space station (ISS), and discuss its applicability to audience members.

TOPIC: HFBP-EM is a research program designed to develop a standard set of measures that can be used in space and space-analog research to characterize BMed, Team, Sleep, and HSIA risks. It is an ongoing research project that is used examine the validity and reliability of HFBP measures, as well as their shorter forms. It also serves as a test bed for HFBP measures being considered for the spaceflight standard measures. The suite of measures is used to test the efficacy of countermeasures. To date, HFBP-EM has been collected in Human Exploration Research Analogs campaigns 4 and 5, and the SIRIUS 19 mission in the Russian Ground Based Experiment Complex. A subset of the HFBP-EM suite was collected during spaceflight as part of HRP’s Standard Measures in Spaceflight Project. Data was collected from a total of 55 multinational astronaut and astronaut-like crewmembers (mean age: 39.5, SD = 7.6; 31% female; 91% with advanced degrees). Three broad categories of HFBP-EM measures and their relevance to HRP risks will be discussed: 1) surveys that assess team functioning (Teams risk) as well as mood and affect (Bmed risk), 2) performance-based tasks of cognitive functioning and operationally relevant performance (Bmed risk), and 3) physiological biomarkers of sleep (sleep risk) and heart rate (Bmed risk). We will provide an overview of the background of the HFBP-EM program, what the suite currently includes, and next steps in its future development. We will also discuss the application to aerospace practitioners and researchers.

APPLICATION: Astronaut teams selected for future space exploration missions will face several challenges that pose significant yet still unknown risks to the behavioral health and performance of astronauts. The HFBP-EM suite provides a comprehensive assessment of behavioral health and performance in space analog and spaceflight settings. This suite can be applied to both operational and research settings to advance risk reduction research for long duration space exploration missions.

20210012759,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Utilizing Gaps and Key Performance Parameters to Inform NASA Environmental Control and Life Support and Human Health and Performance Capability Technology Decisions ,"[""James L Broyan"",""Sharmila D Watkins"",""Morgan B Abney"",""Robyn L Gatens"",""Darcy E Elburn"",""Alexander Burg""]","Human spaceflight is a complex endeavor requiring a multitude of capabilities for transportation, crew health, scientific goals, and safe return to Earth.  The difference between spaceflight proven capabilities and those needed for a particular mission is defined as a capability gap.  Capability gaps are not technology specific.  Each capability gap is approachable with a wide array of technologies that have unique benefits and challenges.  Determining what a capability’s relevant and distinguishing key performance parameters (KPPs) are for a mission is critical.  Mass, power, and volume are always constrained and important, but defining these in a way normalized by performance is challenging.  Additionally, KPP definition for reliability, dormancy, and integration needs are very important and still evolving. This paper provides the approach of the Environmental Control and Life Support – Crew Health and Performance (ECLSS-CHP) System Capability Leadership Team (SCLT) to defining gaps and KPPs in support of the NASA’s Capabilities Integration Team data call objectives.  The nine ECLSS-CHP capability areas are decomposed to capabilities, gaps, and KPPs. Rather than defining very detailed gaps, ECLSS-CHP defines high-level gaps to be technology agnostic.  Within a gap, detailed KPPs are defined to both compare technologies and measure progress within a technology over time.  Ideally, KPPs are clearly defined, widely communicated both internally and externally, and provide a common nomenclature to describe the state of the art and the degree of improvement required for exploration missions.  KPPs help define when the gap is closed and the core mission objectives can be accomplished.  Further technology improvements to enhance the capability, as measured by improved KPPs, must then be weighed against investments in open capability gaps that prevent NASA from achieving its exploration missions.  It is uncommon that a technology maturation to improve all the relevant KPPs simultaneously but using KPPs is a critical technology investment decision making component.  In addition to traditional technology selections, KPPs are informing how investments in ground testing prior to and in parallel with ISS technology demonstrations are required to improve reliability KPPs.  The collection of all major technology activities within a capability area are captured on technology roadmaps to communicate how diverse program activities are coordinated to close gaps and infuse into exploration mission needs. A selection of ECLSS-CHP gaps and KPPs and their formulation, current state, and how they inform capability roadmap planning are discussed.  
The paper will contain a summary of the approximately 60 gaps.  Gaps are classified as to their type (architecture, knowledge, technology, developmental, or engineering) depending on the magnitude of the gap.  The paper will provide brief overviews of a few major technology challenges and the technologies being considered, but will reference detailed papers for a more thorough treatment of the challenges and state of the art. Data analysis of the gaps is in work and results are not currently available for this abstract. It is anticipated the paper will include examples of select KPPs with descriptions as to why these are the relevant measures.  Additionally some KPPs will be graphically presented over time to show progress to date and when performance targets need to be achieved to support exploration missions.  Graphical summaries of how gaps closures with near term mission elements support follow-on mission elements will be provided.

Investigations aimed towards understanding the health risks of the astronauts from exposures to space radiation involved mostly physical measurements of the dose and the linear energy transfer (LET) spectrum. Measurement of the dose rate on the Shuttle provided invariable new data for different periods of the solar cycle, whereas measurement of the LET spectrum using the tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) produced the most complete mapping of the radiation environment of the low Earth orbits (LEO). Exposures to the Shuttle astronauts were measured by the personal dosimeter worn by the crewmembers. Analysis of over 300 personal dosimeter readings indicated a dependence on the mission duration, the altitude and inclination of the orbit, and the solar cycle, with the crewmembers on the launch and repair of the Hubble telescope receiving the highest doses due to the altitude of the mission. Secondary neutrons inside the Shuttle were determined by recoil protons or with Bonner spheres, and may contribute significantly to the risks of the crewmembers. In addition, the skin dose and the doses received at different organs were compared using a human phantom onboard a Shuttle mission. A number of radiobiology investigations wer e also performed. The biological doses were determined on six astronauts/cosmonauts on long-duration Shuttle/Mir missions and on two crewmembers on a Hubble repair mission by analyzing the damages in the chromosomes of the crewmembers? white blood cells. Several experiments were also conducted to address the question of possible synergistic effects of spaceflight, microgravity in particular, on the repair of radiation-induced DNA damages. The experimental design included exposure of cells before launch, during flight, or after landing. These physical and biological studies were invaluable in predicting the health risks for astronauts on ISS and future exploration missions. Educational Objectives: A group of high school students flew color negative films on tw o Shuttle missions to detect the radiation environment in orbit. This and other experiments onboard of the Shuttle were aimed at educating the general public of the space program.","[{""submissionId"":20110015964,""id"":""1e6d1b582e274e02b400785170ef2ba7"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20110015964,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States"",""id"":""1faa886aeca74702b842c6d3d4f71796""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110015964,""endDate"":""2012-05-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""65323e192c0e4dc5af8d2b86b90401da"",""id"":""95a1303053a042b1ab5aaae0f54a6eae""}],""name"":""83rd AsMA Annual Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""Atlanta, GA"",""id"":""65323e192c0e4dc5af8d2b86b90401da"",""startDate"":""2012-05-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110015964

20130013505,TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM,Effects of the 8 psia / 32% O2 Atmosphere on the Human in the Spaceflight Environment,"[""Norcross, Jason"",""Norsk, Peter"",""Law, Jennifer"",""Arias, Diana"",""Conkin, Johnny"",""Perchonok, Michele"",""Menon, Anil"",""Huff, Janice"",""Fogarty, Jennifer"",""Wessel, James H., III"",""Whitmire, Sandra""]","Extravehicular activity (EVA) is at the core of a manned space exploration program. There are elements of exploration that may be safely and effectively performed by robots, but there are critical elements of exploration that will require the trained, assertive, and reasoning mind of a human crewmember. To effectively use these skills, NASA needs a safe, effective, and efficient EVA component integrated into the human exploration program. The EVA preparation time should be minimized and the suit pressure should be low to accommodate EVA tasks without undue fatigue, physical discomfort, or suit-related trauma. Commissioned in 2005, the Exploration Atmospheres Working Group (EAWG) had the primary goal of recommending to NASA an internal environment that allowed efficient and repetitive EVAs for missions that were to be enabled by the former Constellation Program. At the conclusion of the EAWG meeting, the 8.0 psia and 32% oxygen (O2) environment were recommended for EVA intensive phases of missions. As a result of selecting this internal environment, NASA gains the capability for efficient EVA with low risk of decompression sickness (DCS), but not without incurring additional negative stimulus of hypobaric hypoxia to the already physiologically challenging spaceflight environment. This paper provides a literature review of the human health and performance risks associated with the 8 psia/32% O2 environment. Of most concern are the potential effects on the central nervous system including increased intracranial pressure, visual impairment, sensorimotor dysfunction, and oxidative damage. Other areas of focus include validation of the DCS mitigation strategy, incidence and treatment of acute mountain sickness (AMS), development of new exercise countermeasures protocols, effective food preparation at 8 psia, assurance of quality sleep, and prevention of suit-induced injury. As a first effort, the trade space originally considered in the EAWG was re-evaluated looking for ways to decrease the hypoxic dose by further enriching the O2% or increasing the pressure. After discussion with the NASA engineering and materials community, it was determined that the O2 could be enriched from 32% to 34% and the pressure increased from 8.0 to 8.2 psia without significant penalty. These two small changes increase alveolar O2 pressure by 11 mmHg, which is expected to significantly benefit crewmembers. The 8.2/34 environment (inspired O2 pressure = 128 mmHg) is also physiologically equivalent to the staged decompression atmosphere of 10.2 psia / 26.5% O2 (inspired O2 pressure = 127 mmHg) used on 34 different shuttle missions for approximately a week each flight. Once decided, the proposed internal environment, if different than current experience, should be evaluated through appropriately simulated research studies. In many cases, the human physiologic concerns can be investigated effectively through integrated multi-discipline ground-based studies. Although missions proposing to use an 8.2/34 environment are still years away, it is recommended that these studies begin early enough to ensure that the correct decisions pertaining to vehicle design, mission operational concepts, and human health countermeasures are appropriately informed.","[{""submissionId"":20130013505,""id"":""8ad43b18ddb54454a2682ec449ec12ac"",""publicationDate"":""2013-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20130013505
20170004604,OTHER,Risk of Adverse Health Outcomes and Decrements in Performance Due to In-flight Medical Conditions,"[""Antonsen,Erik""]","The drive to undertake long-duration space exploration missions at greater distances from Earth gives rise to many challenges concerning human performance under extreme conditions. At NASA, the Human Research Program (HRP) has been established to investigate the specific risks to astronaut health and performance presented by space exploration, in addition to developing necessary countermeasures and technology to reduce risk and facilitate safer, more productive missions in space (NASA Human Research Program 2009). The HRP is divided into five subsections, covering behavioral health, space radiation, habitability, and other areas of interest. Within this structure is the ExMC Element, whose research contributes to the overall development of new technologies to overcome the challenges of expanding human exploration and habitation of space. The risk statement provided by the HRP to the ExMC Element states: ""Given that medical conditions/events will occur during human spaceflight missions, there is a possibility of adverse health outcomes and decrements in performance in mission and for long term health"" (NASA Human Research Program 2016). Within this risk context, the Exploration Medical Capabilities (ExMC) Element is specifically concerned with establishing evidenced-based methods of monitoring and maintaining astronaut health. Essential to completing this task is the advancement in techniques that identify, prevent, and treat any health threats that may occur during space missions. The ultimate goal of the ExMC Element is to develop and demonstrate a pathway for medical system integration into vehicle and mission design to mitigate the risk of medical issues. Integral to this effort is inclusion of an evidence-based medical and data handling system appropriate for long-duration, exploration-class missions. This requires a clear Concept of Operations, quantitative risk metrics or other tools to address changing risk throughout a mission, and system scoping and system engineering. Because of the novel nature of the risks involved in exploration missions, new and complex ethical challenges are likely to be encountered. This document describes the relevant background and evidence that informs the development of an exploration medical system.","[{""submissionId"":20170004604,""id"":""d40b170af4d544449037a929dbdb3ab7"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Lunar And Planetary Science And Exploration"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170004604

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a central role, inducing lesions like 8-oxo-guanine that compromise transcription and translation, leading to dysfunctional proteins. This review explores the biochemical basis of RDDs, their exacerbation under oxidative stress, and their dual roles in cellular adaptation and disease.

RDDs contribute to genomic instability and are implicated in cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases, while also driving phenotypic diversity. Drawing on terrestrial and spaceflight studies, we highlight the intersection of oxidative stress, RDD formation, and cellular dysfunction, proposing innovative mitigation approaches.
Advancements in RDD detection and quantification, along with ROS management therapies, offer new avenues to restore cellular homeostasis and promote resilience. By positioning RDDs as a hallmark of genomic entropy, this review underscores the limits of biological adaptation. Furthermore, the prevalence of guanine-rich codons in antioxidant genes reflects a compensatory strategy against ROS-induced damage, linking redox stress, genomic instability, and constrained adaptation. These insights have profound implications for understanding aging, disease progression, and adaptive mechanisms in both terrestrial and space environments.

The overall scope of this project is to test the hypothesis that Ionizing Radiation (IR), microgravity

Simulation’ exposure for immune, brain and performance responses in crew age-matched adult
male and female mice; (2) Determine effects of acute ‘Five-Ion GCR Simulation’ exposure singly
and in combination with simulated microgravity and social isolation, on immune, brain and
performance responses in crew age-matched male and female mice mimicking deep space
missions; and (3) Determine efficacy of the dietary antioxidant, Nicotinamide Mononucleotide

20250009058,CONFERENCE_PAPER,ISS4Mars: Using Low Earth Orbit Stations to Enable Human Exploration of Mars,"[""Jancy McPhee"",""Livio Narici""]","ISS4Mars is a global initiative to use the International Space Station (ISS) as an analog of human missions to Mars. The ISS provides a spaceflight platform that can be used to test different operational scenarios that mimic the autonomy, duration, and communication delays expected during a Mars mission. Studies conducted on the ISS can assess the risks that astronauts will encounter during a Mars mission and the integrated technologies and countermeasures required to keep them safe. The idea of using the ISS as a testbed for a Mars Mission was first presented in Prague at the Humans in Space Symposium in 2015. After two international workshops, one held in Rome in 2018, and one held remotely in 2020–2021, space agencies agreed to implement a stepwise approach, starting with simple use cases. Five use cases were identified, and the international Multilateral Human Research Panel for Exploration (MHRPE) added more details to the use cases, including considerations for operational feasibility, and each agency’s desired role in preparing for potential implementation. The MHRPE then selected four of these use cases and one space agency to lead the development of each implementation plan. These four use cases are described in this paper, focusing on which facets of a Mars mission they will survey and the operational challenges of implementing them on the ISS. The following practices regarding the ISS4Mars initiative are discussed: (1) scenarios, technologies, and countermeasures must be first tested in terrestrial analogs of spaceflight, parabolic flight, or suborbital and shorter duration orbital spaceflight; (2) ISS4Mars studies should not affect other research being conducted on the ISS, however, they should represent some of the highest priority research to enable human exploration; (3) commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) stations should be considered for implementing these studies post-ISS; (4) new international collaborative methods and partnerships should be pursued, if needed, to implement these studies on the ISS. These use cases are a first step toward using LEO and lunar platforms as analogs to prepare for future Mars missions. Ultimately, many, if not all, Mars mission operations will be tested in advance to optimize integration and synergy. This testing will require extensive planning, potentially involving scaling up single use cases to a multiple use case approach. By safely working close to Earth using the ISS4Mars approach, international agencies and commercial partners can develop the vehicles and tools needed to enable human exploration of Mars.

R.""]","Throughout the history of human spaceflight, crewmembers have experienced various in-flight medical conditions including illness and injury. Planned missions to the Moon and Mars will require capabilities to maintain the health of future space travelers. Mass, power, and volume available in the vehicles and habitats for these missions will be severely constrained; resupply of resources will be limited or non-existent, as will opportunities for evacuation to Earth. Furthermore, ground-based support will be hampered by communication latencies and blackouts. These vehicle and mission constraints will necessitate a medical system that has been efficiently planned, providing on-board procedural guidance in addition to a variety of medical devices and consumable resources. Medical capabilities required for the diagnosis and treatment of potential medical conditions during future spaceflight missions may include real-time health monitoring, medical imaging, and biomarker analyses ( e.g., blood or urine). Terrestrial medicine shares these needs, thus many of these medical capabilities could likely be satisfied by Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices and methodologies; however, in some cases the unique space environment and increased mission duration will drive the need to modify technologies and the way care is provided. 

NASA’s Human Research Program (HRP) Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element and Mars Campaign Office’s Exploration Medical Integrated Product Team (XMIPT) are working together to decrease medical risk during exploration missions. Flight-tested medical diagnostic and treatment technologies are necessary to effectively manage medical conditions relevant to exploration missions while meeting vehicle constraints, integrating with medical decision-support tools, and enabling increasingly Earth-independent operations. Several projects have leveraged the ISS as a testbed for exploration, including 1) i n-  situ blood analysis, 2) medical inventory, 3) intravenous fluid generation, and 4) autonomous medical procedure guidance.

Management of several in-flight medical conditions, such as bacterial and viral infections and acute radiation syndrome, is dramatically improved with ability to assess blood cell populations, electrolytes, and metabolites. I  n December 2020 and January 2021 ExMC performed an ISS technology demonstration (Tech Demo) of the HemoCue® WBC DIFF analyzer (HemoCue, Brea, CA), a COTS device that was modified to enable functionality in a spaceflight environment. This Tech Demo marked the first time that hematology measurements were successfully performed real-time in microgravity.  Also modified and demonstrated was the
reusable Handheld Electrolytes and Lab Technology for Humans (rHEALTH) ONE analyzer (rHEALTH, Bedford, MA), which uses flow cytometry and sheath-based hydrodynamic focusing methodologies. The rHEALTH ONE ISS Tech Demo in May 2022 demonstrated test results obtained in-flight matched those on the ground.  

NASA currently relies on crew self-reporting to manage and maintain medical inventory on ISS.The ability to maintain an accurate inventory becomes more critical during long duration missions since the crew will need to be increasingly autonomous in finding and utilizing medical items, including those scenarios when alternative treatments need to be considered due to limited or no resupply.  HRP’s Medical Consumables Tracking (MCT) project was developed by ZIN Technologies, Inc. (Cleveland, OH), and demonstrated real-time tracking of medical supplies aboard the ISS between December 2016 and July 2018. The MCT system design utilized Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) technology to perform automated inventory and was installed in the Crew Health Care System (CHeCS) Resupply Stowage Rack (RSR).

The challenge of limited shelf life, exacerbated by the lack of resupply opportunities, affects a plethora of medical system components including consumables, pharmaceuticals, and intravenous (IV) fluid. In 2010, ExMC funded ZIN Technologies, Inc. (Cleveland, OH), to develop the Intravenous Fluid Generation (IVGEN) system. IV fluids were successfully generated with IVGEN using the potable water supply on ISS during ISS Expedition 23. The XMIPT is in the process of developing a miniaturized version of the original IVGEN hardware for a future Tech Demo aboard the ISS.   

Current ISS medical operations rely heavily on preflight training and real-time remote guidance, both of which become impractical or impossible for exploration missions. The primary goal of the Autonomous Medical Officer Support (AMOS) Software Tech Demos on ISS was to confirm telemedical proof-of-concept for autonomous medical imaging in an operational setting. This novel software tool shifts emphasis from preflight training and real-time remote guidance to in-flight just-in-time instruction, a new and necessary paradigm for crew medical autonomy. AMOS introduces a novel, streamlined skill management concept for exploration missions featuring comprehensive training and guidance modules for ultrasound examinations using the ISS Ultrasound 2 (a modified GE Vivid-q™; General Electric HealthCare, Chicago, IL).  With no prior crew training or remote guidance, two Tech Demos on the ISS (April 2020 and June 2022) resulted in high quality, clinically useful image sets.

We will provide a review of historical, current, and planned medical devices and technologies considered for inclusion within future spaceflight medical systems and summarize hardware development activities and medical device tech demos conducted on the ISS.","[{""submissionId"":20240004905,""publisher"":""ISSRDC"",""id"":""ef873381b3b649eca0805b852e7458ac"",""publicationName"":""International Space Station Research and Development Conference"",""publicationDate"":""2024-07-29T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""issuePublicationDate"":""2024-07-29T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240004905,""endDate"":""2024-08-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""fcc9f826b7b6469da0f31c6b241706f7"",""id"":""18f391943c0a44e49d13b6f6bf208b47""}],""name"":""International Space Station Research and Development Conference (ISSRDC)"",""location"":""Boston, MA"",""id"":""fcc9f826b7b6469da0f31c6b241706f7"",""url"":""https://issconference.org/"",""startDate"":""2024-07-30T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""305041"",""NNC14CA02C"",""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240004905

Subtle changes within the monocyte and T cell populations can also be noted by flow cytometric analysis. The similarity between the immunological changes observed after spaceflight and other diverse environmental stressors suggest that most of these alterations may be neuroendocrine-mediated. Available data support the hypothesis that spaceflight and other environmental stressors modulate normal immune regulation via stress hormones, other than exclusively glucocorticoids. It will be essential to simultaneously collect in-flight endocrine, immunologic, and infectious illness data to determine the clinical significance of these results. Additional research that delineates the neuroendocrine mechanisms of stress-induced changes in normal immune regulation will allow clinicians in the future to initiate prophylactic immunomodulator therapy to restore immune competence altered by the stress of long-duration spaceflight and therefore reduce morbidity from infectious illness, autoimmune disease, or malignancy.","[{""volume"":""54"",""submissionId"":20050000427,""issue"":""3"",""issn"":""0741-5400"",""id"":""7f0e80be9e9b4249b5c20da6cf9947df"",""publicationName"":""Journal of leukocyte biology"",""publicationDate"":""1993-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050000427
20240011729,ABSTRACT,Risk Characterization Research for Artemis II: Human Factors and Behavioral Performance ,"[""S T Bell"",""S R Begerowski"",""S I Dev"",""S R Anderson"",""L B Landon"",""A M Khader"",""P Dickson"",""James Garrett"",""E Flynn-Evans"",""M Young"",""A Vera""]","<b>BACKGROUND</b>
Artemis II will be the first time NASA astronauts go beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) since the Apollo era, and the first astronauts heading into space in the Orion vehicle. As such, it provides a critical opportunity to refine our understanding of the likelihood and consequences associated with the Behavioral Medicine (BMed), Team, Human System Integration Architecture (HSIA), and Sleep Risks, and prepare for future Moon and Mars missions.  However, Artemis II research efforts are uniquely shaped by in-mission data collection constraints. There is currently no in-mission crew time available to complete measures. In-mission data will need to be collected unobtrusively from available data streams (e.g., audiovisual, existing records such as schedules, and actigraphy). 

Accordingly, the overarching goal of our research is to utilize Artemis II data to further define the likelihood and consequences of these risks, and to create an unobtrusive research infrastructure that can be expanded to include future Artemis missions. This goal spans four aims across three research phases: (1) identify and operationally define key performances metrics and constructs across the four aforementioned risks, (2) develop an unobtrusive methodology and coding scheme for in-mission data collection, (3) characterize performance decrements due to Bmed, Team, HSIA, and Sleep Risks, and (4) develop a data infrastructure for future Artemis missions. The following details results of Phase I efforts in which we address Aims 1 and 2 to develop an unobtrusive measurement plan and coding scheme to capture key constructs, contributing factors, and performance decrements across each risk area. 

<b>METHOD</b>
As part of Phase I, we conducted an interdisciplinary literature review and consulted with SMEs to identify unobtrusive methodologies that leverage text, audio, and/or video data as well as conceptualize key performance metrics, contributing factors, and BMed, Team, HSIA, and Sleep risk constructs related to performance decrements. The Phase I effort resulted in a finalized pre- and post-mission protocol for Artemis II, along with a measurement and coding scheme for in-mission Artemis II data. Phase II will involve data collection from the upcoming Artemis II mission. Phase III will include data processing, coding, depiction, analysis, and report writing of the Artemis II data. 

<b>RESULTS & DISCUSSION</b>
To date, we have completed Phase I efforts. Specifically, we identified BMed, Team, HSIA, and Sleep risk constructs related to performance metrics, summarized how these constructs can be measured using audiovisual data collected during the mission, and worked with NASA’s HFBP Element to finalize a data collection protocol that leverages audiovisual input from the Orion spacecraft system. Our protocol includes novel unobtrusive methodologies that adhere to in-mission data streams and subsequent constraints (e.g., limited storage space on GoPro cameras, ambient noise impeding audio files) to best capture in-mission phenomena across each risk area. We will present our results from Phase I efforts, namely best practices for unobtrusive measurement as identified through literature reviews and SME consultation as well as codebook excerpts for use in Artemis II. We will include a description of planned work as we prepare for Phase II and Phase III of this research plan and the Artemis II mission itself.

20150010417,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Bone Loss During Spaceflight: Available Models and Counter-Measures,"[""Morris, Jonathan "",""Bach, David"",""Geller, David""]","There is ongoing concern for human health during spaceflights. Of particular interest is the uncoupling of bone remodeling and its resultant effect on calcium metabolism and bone loss. The calculated average loss of bone mineral density (BMD) is approximately 1-1.5% per month of spaceflight. The effect of decreased BMD on associated fractures in astronauts is not known. Currently on the International Space Station (ISS), bone loss is managed through dietary supplements and modifications and resistance exercise regimen. As the duration of space flights increases, a review of the current methods available for the prevention of bone loss is warranted. The goal of this project is to review and summarize recent studies that have focused on maintaining BMD during exposure to microgravity. Interventions were divided into physical (Table 1), nutritional (Table 2), or pharmacologic (Table 3) categories. Physical modalities included resistance exercise, low level vibration, and low intensity pulsed ultrasound. Nutritional interventions included altering protein, salt, and fat intake; and vitamin D supplementation. Pharmacologic interventions included the use of bisphosphonates and beta blockers. Studies reported outcomes based on bone density determined by DXA bone scan, micro-architecture of histology and microCT, and serum and urine markers of bone turnover. The ground analog models utilized to approximate osseous physiology in microgravity included human patients previously paralyzed or subjects confined to bedrest. Ground analog animal models include paralysis, immobilization and ovariectomies. As a result of the extensive research performed there is a multi-modality approach available for the management of BMD during spaceflight that includes resistance training, nutrition and dietary supplements. However, there is a paucity of literature describing a formalized tiered protocol to guide investigators through the progression from animal models to human patient ground analogs to experiments on the ISS. With regards to testing, further evaluation to determine the association between non-invasive tests and fracture during and after spaceflight needs to be performed.","[{""submissionId"":20150010417,""id"":""e7ae53b8abcb4adc87b4a0c2da49b4f2"",""publicationDate"":""2015-07-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150010417,""name"":""American Astronomical Society"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States"",""id"":""a11996ca28fb47529caf30df16dd737a""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150010417,""endDate"":""2015-07-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d59d8ba5a47b4053b55794af5ae063bd"",""id"":""4e618e9f18044ed8ba1120830a18565e""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Astronomical Society"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d59d8ba5a47b4053b55794af5ae063bd"",""id"":""cfec392ede174e45aaeaa5bb03e16e06""}],""name"":""ISS R&D Conference"",""location"":""Boston, MA"",""id"":""d59d8ba5a47b4053b55794af5ae063bd"",""startDate"":""2015-07-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Exobiology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150010417
20090038926,ABSTRACT,Human System Risk Management - Tools of our Trade,"[""Ott, C. Mark""]","The risk of infectious disease to select individuals has historically been difficult to predict in either spaceflight or on Earth with health care efforts relying on broad-based prevention and post-infection treatment. Over the past 10 years, quantitative microbial risk assessment evaluations have evolved to formalize the assessment process and quantify the risk. This process of hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose-response assessment, and risk characterization has been applied by the water and food safety industries to address the public health impacts associated with the occurrence of and human exposure to pathogens in water and food for the development of preventive strategies for microbial disease. NASA is currently investigating the feasibility of using these techniques to better understand the risks to astronauts and refine their microbiological requirements. To assess these techniques, NASA began an evaluation of the potable water system on the International Space Station to determine how the microbial risk from water consumption during flight differed from terrestrial sources, such as municipal water systems. The ultimate goal of this work is to optimize microbial requirements which would minimize unnecessary cargo and use of crew time, while still protecting the health of the crew. Successful demonstration of this risk assessment framework with the water system holds the potential to maximize the use of available resources during spaceflight missions and facilitate investigations into the evaluation of other routes of infection, such as through the spaceflight foods system.","[{""submissionId"":20090038926,""id"":""0cf90f5d977e49f1a01497f8488ce5f2"",""publicationDate"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20090038926,""endDate"":""2010-05-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Aerospace Medicine Association Meeting"",""location"":""Phoenix, AZ"",""id"":""ac87c5e0dda3406da3dfae9d1cc21398"",""startDate"":""2010-05-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090038926
20130000749,ABSTRACT,Bridging the Gap: Use of Spaceflight Technologies for Earth-Based Problems,"[""Brinley, Alaina"",""Vidlak, Carissa"",""Davis, Jeffrey R.""]","Spaceflight is colloquially deemed, the final frontier, or the last area which humans have not yet explored in great depth. While this is true, there are still many regions on Earth that remain isolated from the urban, socially and electronically connected world. Because travelling to space requires a great deal of foresight, engineers are required to think creatively in order to invent technologies that are durable enough to withstand the rigors of the unique and often treacherous environment of outer space. The innovations that are a result of spaceflight designs can often be applied to life on Earth, particularly in the rural, isolated communities found throughout the world. The NASA Human Health and Performance Center (NHHPC) is a collaborative, virtual forum that connects businesses, non-profit organizations, academia, and government agencies to allow for better distribution of ideas and technology between these entities (http://www.nasa.gov/offices/NHHPC). There are many technologies that have been developed for spaceflight that can be readily applied to rural communities on Earth. For example, water filtration systems designed for spaceflight must be robust and easily repaired; therefore, a system with these qualifications may be used in rural areas on Earth. This particular initiative seeks to connect established, non-profit organizations working in isolated communities throughout the world with NASA technologies devised for spaceflight. These technologies could include water purification systems, solar power generators, or telemedicine techniques. Applying innovative, spaceflight technologies to isolated communities on Earth provides greater benefits from the same research dollars, thus fulfilling the Space Life Science motto at Johnson Space Center: Exploring Space and Enhancing Life. This paper will discuss this NHHPC global outreach initiative and give examples based on the recent work of the organization.","[{""submissionId"":20130000749,""id"":""e739f66fb7744750b083d73d67fc1b26"",""publicationDate"":""2012-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Italy"",""submissionId"":20130000749,""endDate"":""2012-10-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""63rd International Astronautical Congress"",""location"":""Naples"",""id"":""e76cbc15a8844f608f01e701f3808326"",""startDate"":""2012-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Technology Utilization And Surface Transportation""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20130000749

20220007465,OTHER,"Risk of Performance and Behavioral Health Decrements Due to Inadequate Cooperation, Coordination, and Psychosocial Adaptions within a Team","[""Lauren Blackwell Landon""]","The Risk of Performance and Behavioral Health Decrements Due to Inadequate Cooperation, Coordination, Communication, and Psychosocial Adaptation within a Team (the Team Risk) is primarily performance-focused, with a secondary emphasis on behavioral health outcomes resulting from team performance and interpersonal interactions. Monitoring tools, measures, and countermeasures are aimed at enhancing team processes and team composition configurations to optimize team performance and functioning. Long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs) will include major challenges that could affect team performance, including social isolation, physical confinement, a small and diverse crew, communication delays between crew and ground, limited or no crew rotation or evacuation options, limited or no resupply, and a high-consequence environment. Each of these conditions will affect the crew’s coordination, cooperation, psychological well-being, and performance. 

Although the International Space Station (ISS) remains important for studies that require spaceflight testing and validation, the current conditions on the ISS do not adequately mimic the exploration environment that is required for National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) teams research, and thus access to terrestrial or ground-based analogs of LDEM conditions is paramount. The emphasis on analogs for research is reflected in this updated evidence review of the Team Risk, and includes data from studies conducted at isolated, confined, extreme (ICE) environments (e.g., Antarctic stations), and from several mission simulation analogs such as the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) (HERA Experiment Information Package, 2014), also known as isolated, confined, controlled (ICC) environments. These studies have characterized many team factors regarding LDEMs, and the Team Risk has now matured from risk characterization to focusing more on countermeasure development.

Because spaceflight evidence for team-level research is lacking, no reliable data is available to quantify the impact of team-level variables on individual and team-level outcomes during spaceflight missions. Until recently, no systematic attempt had been undertaken to measure the performance effects of team cohesion, team composition, team training, or team-related psychosocial adaptation during spaceflight. The Team Risk is a relatively young research area for NASA, with substantial growth only since the 2000s, and with limited access to spaceflight performance data. As a result, spaceflight evidence is lacking to identify specifically what team composition, level of training, amount of cohesion, or quality of psychosocial adaptation is necessary to reduce the risk of performance errors in space. However, astronaut journals and interviews and reports from spaceflight subject matter experts (SMEs) provide testimonies that team performance during spaceflight is important for mission success and to maintain crew health. Team spaceflight data is now being collected as part of the Spaceflight Standard Measures task (Clement, 2021)—a set of core measurements related to many human spaceflight risks that are collected from astronauts before, during, and after long-duration missions. The team-related standard measures focus on team cohesion, team performance, group living, team climate, and team processes. Collection of standard measures data is ongoing and published data is not yet available. Finally, although spaceflight evidence is lacking, evidence gleaned from ground studies and spaceflight analog studies will help close the gaps outlined in the Team Risk. 

Ground-based studies provide quantitative evidence for team functioning in ICE environments. Academic research on teams has produced dozens of meta-analyses that can be used to understand the general relationships among team inputs (e.g., team member characteristics and skills, job context), team processes, and emergent states (e.g., coordination, communication, cooperation, cohesion, trust, shared cognition), and team outcomes (e.g., effectiveness, errors, adaptation). Teams are complex, incorporating individual characteristics of team members, but also existing at a level that is greater than the sum of its parts. Therefore, the Team Risk must be integrated with other individual-focused NASA Human Research Program (HRP) risks, including Behavioral Medicine (BMed), Sleep, and Human-Systems Integration Architecture (HSIA), and emerging research indicates more integration may needed between the Team Risk and the physiologically oriented risks. Much of this integration occurs through the Human Systems Risk Board (HSRB). 

A lack of team functioning may be a stressor in some circumstances, but the team often acts as a countermeasure. For example, support for team leaders and teammates can facilitate individual functioning and encourage psychological and physically healthy behaviors and attitudes. However, more research is needed regarding teams during LDEMs and the remaining gaps in the research are described in the current report.","[{""submissionId"":20220007465,""id"":""8f698537c75748e6a535399147c3aa7b"",""publicationName"":"""",""publicationDate"":""2022-06-10T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""344494.01.01.10""]",undefined,"[""Quality Assurance And Reliability"",""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220007465

Current exercise countermeasures on the International Space Station (ISS) include treadmill running, cycle ergometry, and resistive exercise, which are used to protect crewmember health and performance during long-duration spaceflight. However, exploration vehicles for Artemis and beyond will have volume and power restrictions, requiring exercise hardware to have a smaller footprint and use fewer resources. Thus, recent efforts have focused on developing exercise devices (such as the European Enhanced Exploration Exercise Device [E4D]) that provide both aerobic and resistive training on one platform without including a treadmill. It is critical to validate the efficacy of exploration-focused exercise modalities to preserve muscle strength, aerobic fitness, bone density, and sensorimotor performance. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the physiological effects of spaceflight that occur with nominal ISS exercise prescriptions compared to exploration-forward exercise modalities to determine if a treadmill is required to maintain current levels of protection during long-duration missions.

METHODS:    
Crewmembers will be assigned to one of three groups: 1) Control Group (n ≥ 40), who will partake in nominal exercise on the ISS, including running on the Treadmill with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization 2 (T2), ergometry on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (CEVIS) device, and strength training on the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED); 2) Active Group 1, who will partake in CEVIS and ARED exercise only (n = 8); and 3) Active Group 2, who will partake in aerobic and resistive exercise on the E4D only (n = 8). For Active Group 1, nominal aerobic exercise on T2 will be replaced with corresponding exercise on CEVIS. For Active Group 2, a dedicated exercise prescription will be designed to maximize the capabilities of the E4D to include resistive exercise, cycle ergometry, rowing, and rope pulling. Crewmembers in both active groups will not be permitted to perform treadmill exercise. Health and performance markers including bone mineral density (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]), body composition (DXA), cardiovascular fitness (cycle VO2peak), muscle strength and endurance (isometric/isokinetic testing, power endurance testing), sensorimotor performance (sit-to-stand, obstacle course), postural control (computerized dynamic posturography), and blood and urine biochemical markers of bone metabolism will be assessed before, during, and following spaceflight.

RESULTS:    
Thirteen subjects (3 Active [CEVIS + ARED], 10 Control) have been recruited for this study. Data collection is currently in progress. 

CONCLUSIONS:    
This study will assess the efficacy of exploration exercise modalities, including the effects of removing the treadmill exercise capability or of exclusively using the E4D, compared to nominal ISS exercise across an entire mission on bone, muscle, aerobic, and sensorimotor health and performance. Findings from this study will help provide a recommendation on whether these exploration exercise modalities can sufficiently protect against physiological deconditioning during spaceflight or whether a treadmill may be required to maintain current levels of protection during future exploration class spaceflight missions.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230013483,""endDate"":""2024-02-16T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b9a17cf6b6ff4bcfba7071ac561f9ad9"",""id"":""4c2433ed57fe4929a57580496ad81eb6""}],""name"":""Human Research Program-Investigators Working Group (HRP-IWG)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""b9a17cf6b6ff4bcfba7071ac561f9ad9"",""url"":""https://www.edgereg.net/er/EventHomePage/CustomPage.jsp?ActivityID=42008&ItemID=137127 "",""startDate"":""2024-02-13T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.03.01.32.2161"",""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Lunar and Planetary Science and Exploration"",""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]","[{""id"":20230000790,""title"":""Effects of Replacing Treadmill Running with Alternative Exercise Countermeasures During Long-Duration Spaceflight""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230013483

C."",""Blaber, Elizabeth A."",""Cheng-Campbell, Margareth Ann"",""Jonscher, Karen"",""Pecaut, Michael"",""Schrepfer, Sonja""]","Spaceflight factors, such as microgravity and space radiation, are known to put astronauts at risk for negative effects to their tissue regeneration and degenerative conditions. On our previous spaceflight research, we found that long duration spaceflight produced increased oxidative stress and activation of the inflammatory response as a major contributor to physiological changes, including alterations to the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems, metabolism, and the liver. Proliferation, apoptosis, and ion-channel remodeling of vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as endothelial inflammation, and nitric oxide synthase-nitric oxide system regulation have been shown by spaceflight and simulated spaceflight projects. CDKN1ap21 is a regulatory gene for tissue regeneration and also plays an important role in upregulating oxidative stress caused by radiation. In further research, we have also determined CDKN1ap21 to be overexpressed during spaceflight. When knocked out in mice, however, it protects against unloading-induced changes to the morphology and physiology of carotid arteries. In this proposal, we seek to test a potential dietary countermeasure to down-regulate CDKN1ap21 in the mice and protect against oxidative stress in the rodents. Specifically, we will expose both Wildtype and CDKN1ap21-null mice to hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative stress and observe the molecular mechanisms in which a dietary supplement protects vascular smooth muscle cells against the consequences of the apoptotic environment within Wildtype mice versus the, hypothetically, sound physiology of CDKN1ap21-null mice. The successful completion of this experiment will conclusively determine accuracy of a dietary supplement as a CDKN1ap21 suppressor. This will provide a new perspective on the problem of increased oxidative stress developing into cardiovascular disease as a result of long-term space flight. This research will address the Human Research Plan Roadmaps Risk of Cardiac Rhythm Problems including CV-8, the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Other Degenerative Tissue Effects from Radiation Exposure including Degen-6 and Degen-7, and the Risk of Adverse Health Event from Radiation Exposure including IM-8.

20160013663,ABSTRACT,Programmatic Considerations to Reduce the Risk of Adverse Renal Stone Events in Spaceflight,"[""Antonsen, Erik"",""Pietrzyk, Robert""]","Introduction: Microgravity exposure may alter the likelihood that astronauts will experience renal stones. The potential risk includes both acute and chronic health issues, with the potential for significant impact on mission objectives. Methods: To understand the role of the NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) research agenda in both preventing and addressing renal stones in spaceflight, current astronaut epidemiologic data and a summary of programmatic considerations are reviewed. Results: Although there has never been a symptomatic renal stone event in a U.S. crewmember during spaceflight, urine chemistry has been altered - likely due to induced changes in renal physiology as a result of exposure to microgravity. This may predispose astronauts to stone formation, leading the HRP to conduct and sponsor research to: 1) understand the risk of stone formation in space; 2) prevent stones from forming; and 3) address stones that may form by providing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Discussion: The development of a renal stone during spaceflight is a significant medical concern that requires the HRP to minimize this risk by providing the ability to prevent, diagnose, monitor and treat the condition during spaceflight. A discussion of the risk as NASA understands it is followed by an overview of the multiple mitigations currently under study, including novel ultrasound techniques for stone detection and manipulation, and how they may function as part of a larger exploration medical system.","[{""submissionId"":20160013663,""id"":""2bc24f26aca4426baf153323cbe66d57"",""publicationDate"":""2017-05-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160013663,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States"",""id"":""09da832c4a394a6facd6cd3cee29de0c""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160013663,""endDate"":""2017-05-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""bab1bbbfa6e14f48bbe6a77577f9208c"",""id"":""b522249beda248948091051ebca3ab73""}],""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA) Annual Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""bab1bbbfa6e14f48bbe6a77577f9208c"",""startDate"":""2017-04-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160013663

M."",""Norcross, J."",""Goetchius, E."",""Feiveson, A.""]","NASA’s vision for future exploration missions depends on the ability to protect astronauts’ health and safety for performance of Extravehicular Activity (EVA), and to allow astronauts to safely egress from vehicles in a variety of landing scenarios (e.g. water landing upon return to Earth and undefined planetary/lunar landings). Prolonged exposure to spaceflight results in diminished tolerance to prolonged physical activity, decreased cardiac and sensorimotor function, and loss of bone mineral density, muscle mass, and muscle strength. For over 50 years exercise has been the primary countermeasure against these physiologic decrements during spaceflight, and while the resulting protection is adequate for ISS missions (i.e., Soyuz landing, microgravity EVAs), there is little information regarding time-course changes in muscle and aerobic performance. As spaceflight progresses towards longer exploration missions and vehicles with less robust exercise capabilities compared to ISS, countermeasures will need to be combined and optimized to protect crew health and performance across all organ systems over the course of exploration missions up to 3 years in duration. This will require a more detailed understanding of the dynamic effects of spaceflight on human performance. Thus, the focus of this study is quantifying decrements in physical performance over different mission durations, and to provide detailed information on the physiological rational for “why” and “when” observed changes in performance occur. The research proposed will temporally profile changes in astronauts’ cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle mass, strength, and endurance over spaceflight missions of 2 months, 6 months, and up to 1 year in duration. Additionally, an extrapolation model will provide predictions for changes associated with exploration missions 2-3 years in duration. To accomplish these objectives astronauts will be asked to participate in pre, in, post-flight measurement of muscle performance, muscle size, cardiorespiratory fitness and submaximal performance capabilities, as well as non-invasive assessment of cerebral and muscle oxygenation and perfusion (Table 1). Additionally, ambulatory and in-flight exercise, nutrition, and sleep will be monitored using a variety of commercial technologies and in-flight assessment tools. Significance: Our detailed testing protocol will provide valuable information for describing how and when spaceflight-induced muscle and aerobic based adaptations occur over the course of spaceflight missions up to and beyond 1 year. This information will be vital in the assessment as to whether humans can be physically ready for deep space exploration such as Mars missions with current technology, or if additional mitigation strategies are necessary.

20240001582,CONFERENCE_PAPER,NASA’s Top Human System Research and Technology Needs for Mars,"[""Andrew Frank Abercromby""]","NASA is working with industry and international partners to return humans to the moon and eventually enable a human Mars mission. Within NASA, several organizations work together to identify, prioritize, fund, execute, and operationalize the crew health and performance (CHP) research and technology development (R&D) necessary to enable these future missions. These organizations include flight programs as well as other organizations such as the Health and Medical Technical Authority (HMTA), Human Research Program, Space Technology Mission Directorate, and System Capability Leadership Teams, each of which existed for several years prior to the creation of the Moon-to-Mars (M2M) Program Office in 2023. A variety of constructs, vocabularies, and processes exist for the management of risks and strategic planning across these organizations. For example, M2M objectives, program risks, human system risks, human research gaps, capability gaps, and envisioned futures are all constructs currently used within NASA for identifying and prioritizing R&D needs. 

Alignment and evolution of these strategic planning constructs is ongoing and will allow for alignment and traceability between M2M objectives and R&D investments at a detailed level. While this reorganization is ongoing, and even after it is established, there is a recognized need among stakeholder organizations to identify and communicate the highest CHP R&D priorities in a unified and digestible way that synthesizes the considerations and perspectives of the CHP community across NASA. 

To achieve this, the HMTA facilitated a series of group discussions with representatives of NASA’s CHP community, which culminated in a product identifying the eight highest priority mission-enabling CHP capabilities for human missions to Mars, referred to as the “Top Human System Capability Needs for Mars”. The list includes Earth-Independent Human Operations; Mars Duration Food System; Mars Duration Effects on Human Physiology; Risks Mitigations for Vehicle Atmospheres; Computational Injury & Anthropometric Models; Exploration Exercise Countermeasures; Individual Variability in Responses to Spaceflight; and Sensorimotor Countermeasures. 

Existing strategic planning and risk management tools and processes were considered, as well as practicalities of technical, cost, and schedule feasibility associated with potential R&D risk mitigations and technology solutions. The product is not owned by any one organization and does not replace existing strategic or program planning processes; rather it aims to complement and inform them with a unified set of community generated priorities. It is anticipated that this list will be re-evaluated periodically based on R&D progress and the evolving M2M architecture.

Potential health and functional impacts associated with the various physiological changes during spaceflight are discussed, and areas needing additional research are highlighted. Historically, studies of physiological responses to microgravity have not been aimed at examining gender-specific differences in the astronaut population. Insufficient data exist in most of the discipline areas at this time to draw valid conclusions about gender-specific differences in astronauts, in part due to the small ratio of women to men. The only astronaut health issue for which a large enough data set exists to allow valid conclusions to be drawn about gender differences is orthostatic intolerance following shuttle missions, in which women have a significantly higher incidence of presyncope during stand tests than do men. The most common observation across disciplines is that individual differences in physiological responses within genders are usually as large as, or larger than, differences between genders. Individual characteristics usually outweigh gender differences per se.","[{""volume"":""91"",""submissionId"":20040088708,""issue"":""5"",""issn"":""8750-7587"",""id"":""d92361653c49470d983f54dd2d609538"",""publicationName"":""Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. :  1985)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088708

Among these, the Performance Risk Model (PRisM) represents a novel advancement, extending CHP-PRA’s focus beyond medical systems into the domain of human performance. Such tool could be pivotal in optimizing astronaut capabilities during space travel, thereby enhancing overall mission success.

PRisM leverages data from well-established performance assessments conducted during previous crewed space missions and Earth analogs to strategically predict outcomes for planned tasks, even when direct performance testing has not been conducted for those specific tasks. To evaluate performance, PRisM references the various metrics outlined in NASA-STD-3001 and employs a methodology to integrate different performance scales. This framework analyzes the contribution of various human system task categories (HSTCs) to task execution and compares these contributions to the HSTCs’ involvement in other known tests. The model further employs a Monte Carlo simulation to sample performance scores from their distribution in operationally relevant tests such as those in Mulavara et al. (2018) and, by leveraging similarities in HSTC involvement, transfers this knowledge to actual mission tasks, such as those outlined in the ""Human Exploration of Mars: Preliminary List of Crew Tasks”.

The current PRisM proof-of-concept includes analyses of the impact of exercise and specific medications on astronauts’ performance, with provisions to incorporate additional countermeasures as data becomes available. Furthermore, the tool is customizable to include any system necessary to fully encompass the domain of human systems and can be adapted to evaluate performance for any spaceflight activities as requested by operational stakeholders. PRisM has the potential to assist the Human Research Program in exploring the capabilities trade space for optimized crew performance.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20250000517,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""0f6af3454142448f952a891d2364bf6f"",""id"":""ccf9b5bdac73493ab2c030c228efea7c""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators' Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""0f6af3454142448f952a891d2364bf6f"",""url"":""https://www.nasa.gov/hrp/iws-2025/"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""305041.01.02.10""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250000517

20220013572,CONFERENCE_PAPER,An Oculometric Standard to Assess the Performance of the Ocular System for Long Duration Spaceflight,"[""Kimia Seyedmadani"",""Leland S. Stone"",""Yasemin Akay"",""Metin Akay""]","Changes in the human brain, due to spaceflight, have been a challenge to the space program since its inception; a challenge that is becoming more acute as extended International Space Station (ISS) missions become routine, a return to crewed lunar exploration is about to begin, and a multi-year crewed trip to Mars is being planned. Determining the extent to which neurophysiological adaptations may adversely impact performance in operational tasks, assessing the full-time course of these changes, and identifying/mitigating any potential long-term health consequences are crucial steps required to enable safe crew-autonomous, long-duration, deep-space missions. Vision is the predominant perceptual sense used to guide cognition and motor control in humans. Thus, it is critical for the success of any future, long-duration mission to understand how long-term exposure to microgravity and to other stressors of spaceflight and their interactions, impact visual function.  This is an especially challenging task given the small and disparate samples from which we have been and will be able to collect human performance data. NASA has recently been carefully tracking spaceflight-induced ophthalmic changes, driven in large part by the fluid shifts related to microgravity.  In particular, a recent study of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) postflight measures revealed that more than two-thirds of US crew members experience significant increases in retinal thickness after 6month or longer ISS missions. Space Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) also includes visual acuity decrements and other ocular structural changes that could adversely impact in-flight performance as missions become longer. However, the impact of spaceflight on the visual system is not limited to the retina. Recent comparisons of pre-and post-flight brain images have revealed structural changes throughout the brain that implicate visual, visuomotor, and visual-cognitive pathways, consistent with observed functional impacts (e.g., decreased speed/accuracy/timing of fine goal-oriented movements). Current limitations on inflight testing make it very difficult to determine when and under what conditions SANS and other disruptions of human neurological subsystems arise. Currently, one cannot anticipate the time course and extent of impairment and recovery. This study addresses this knowledge gap by creating an integrated framework of the relevant existing literature on visual and oculomotor function during spaceflight with an eye towards complementing current structural measures of visuomotor impairment with new oculometric standard measures.

20220000282,PRESENTATION,Improving Efficacy and Safety of Pharmacological Treatment Through Precision Health and Pharmacogenomics,"[""Alice R. Tang"",""Emily Stratton"",""Carol Mullenax"",""Jancy Mcphee"",""Corey A. Theriot""]","INTRODUCTION: Future spaceflight will require increased crew medical autonomy as exploration class missions expand in duration and distance from Earth, especially for Mars missions. As mission duration increases, it will be essential to have appropriate amounts of effective medication to ensure the maintenance of crew health and performance. Conversely, mass and volume constraints will become more severe as future spaceflight expands beyond low Earth orbit, where resupply is difficult or becomes impossible. These constraints thus convey an urgency to tailor medications for individual crewmembers and further examine appropriate dosing regimens.

BACKGROUND: Precision Health is an exciting area of medicine focused on maintaining an individual’s health and performance through in-depth understanding of an individual’s unique clinical and environmental history, genetic makeup, and molecular profiles. This approach can be adapted to better predict, monitor, and address physiological responses to the spaceflight environment. A subset of this field is pharmacogenomics (PGX), the study of how the expressed genome impacts drug responses with the goal of prescribing the right dose of the right drug at the right time. Specifically, PGX testing provides valuable information on an individual’s precise allelic variations to guide physicians in making informed decisions on drug choice and dosing to avoid adverse events and maximize efficacy. The study goal was to identify which current space pharmacy drugs could be evaluated using PGX testing and to understand the potential impact on the health and wellness of the astronaut population. Additionally, we sought to evaluate clinically available FDA-approved PGX testing solutions to better understand its applicability.

METHODS: A complete list of drugs on the ISS was analyzed for risk and likelihood of drug failure and PGX actionability. This analysis encompassed both astronauts’ personal medications, including supplements and over the counter drugs (n=151) contained in the ISS medical accessory kit (IMAK), and ISS MedKit formulary medications (n=95). Duplicate medications and different formulations were removed, which resulted in a total of 157 drugs used in the subsequent analysis. A 5x5 risk assessment table was produced by examining the likelihood of drug failure compared to the consequence of drug failure (LxC). Likelihood of individual drug failure was defined by whether existing processes are sufficient to prevent ineffective treatment or impactful side effect events, as ranked from 1 (very low, can easily be prevented) to 5 (very high, cannot be prevented) during a Mars mission. In contrast, the consequence of drug failure was defined by impact to safety, schedule, cost, or technical criteria and ranked from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). An assessment of PGX reference laboratories is currently underway to evaluate sample requirements, benefit analysis (cost vs. utility of allele variant analysis), relevance to inflight medication usage, quality of reporting in enabling clinical application, and ease of integration into electronic medical records.

RESULTS: Risk assessments (LxC 5x5 table) indicated 128 medications were in the green zone where risk is acceptable, with the remaining 29 of the medications in the yellow or red zone driven predominantly due to drug failure or safety concerns. We found that current PGX testing results could impact 21% of the total medications in the ISS MedKit and IMAK; of these, 9 medications currently have direct clinically actionable guidance available. Results of the clinical PGX solution evaluations as related to these medications will be presented.

CONCLUSION: PGX testing has demonstrated clear benefits in terrestrial medicine and clinical environments for the selection of proper medications, avoiding adverse drug reactions, and maximizing drug efficacy. We propose that similar benefits would be bestowed on the astronaut and commercial spaceflight passenger population by performing preemptive preflight PGX testing to reduce risk of mission failure due to ineffective or toxic medications, improve drug efficacy, and further open the door to countermeasure research. For example, PGX results could allow tailoring of specific medications at optimal doses more precisely to each individual astronaut, particularly in areas of space motion sickness, sleep aids, and analgesics. An additional benefit is that PGX results could provide information for better planning of the components of a space pharmacy for deep space missions to be more effective and efficient in the utilization of limited pharmaceutical resources. Finally, while PGX testing of the astronaut corps is not currently conducted, this approach could provide immediate impact in support of mission success by reducing risks, optimizing astronaut performance, and providing valuable insights into long-term astronaut health. Such advancements in clinical decision making are important next steps in building dynamic individual risk profiles for astronauts, increasing selection of the best treatment choice, and providing tailored countermeasures for individual crewmembers.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220000282,""endDate"":""2022-02-10T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""7139d85893f341cd94ad1f51b569c9ae"",""id"":""65118c06bd7749c795422a31dc0fec47""}],""name"":""2022 Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS 2022)"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""7139d85893f341cd94ad1f51b569c9ae"",""startDate"":""2022-02-07T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""836404.02.04.05""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220000282

Furthermore, recent comparisons of pre- and post-flight brain images have revealed structural changes throughout the brain that implicate involvement of visual, visuomotor, and visuo-cognitive pathways. An understanding of the effects of spaceflight on brain function is needed to assess risk and to support the development and validation of countermeasures. The Comprehensive Oculomotor Behavioral Response Assessment (COBRA), an efficient ocular tracking task and analysis that generates a set of reliable and largely independent metrics related to a range of neural areas and functions, has been shown to provide sensitive measures of mild neural impairment due to brain injury], sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption, and retinal pathology. At previous IWS meetings, we presented normative overall oculometric baselines for future comparisons with at risk populations such as crew, or neurological and ophthalmological patients. Our goal here is develop specific measures of retinal health by isolating performance features limited by retinal processing.

20240008185,PRESENTATION,Biological Research and Space Health Enabled by Machine Learning to Support Deep Space Missions,"[""Ryan T Scott"",""Lauren Sanders"",""Sylvain Costes""]","A key science goal of the NASA “Moon to Mars” campaign is to understand how biology responds to the Lunar, Martian, and deep space environments in order to advance fundamental knowledge, reduce risk, and support safe, productive human space missions. Through the powerful emerging approaches of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), a paradigm shift has begun in biomedical science and engineered astronaut health systems, to enable Earth independence and autonomy of mission operations.

Here we present an overview of AI/ML architecture to support deep space mission goals, developed with leaders in the field. First, we focus on the fundamental biological research that supports our understanding of physiological responses to spaceflight, and we describe current efforts to support AI/ML research including data standardization and data engineering through maximally open and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) databases and the generation of AI-ready datasets for reuse and analysis. We also discuss remote data management frameworks for research data as well as environmental and health data that are generated during deep space missions. We highlight several research projects that leverage data standardization and management for fundamental biological discovery to uncover the complex effects of space travel on living systems.

Next, we provide an overview of cutting-edge AI/ML approaches that can be integrated to support remote monitoring and analysis during deep space missions, including generative models and large language models to learn the underlying biomedical patterns and predict outcomes or answer questions during off world medical scenarios. We also describe current AI/ML methods
to support this research and monitoring through automated cloud-based labs which enable limited human intervention and closed-loop experimentation in remote settings. These labs could support mission autonomy by analyzing environmental data streams, and would be facilitated through in situ analytics capabilities to avoid sending large raw data files through low bandwidth communications.

Finally, in the context of deep space missions with limited communications or access to medical advice from Earth, we describe a solution for integrated, real-time mission biomonitoring across hierarchical levels from continuous environmental monitoring, to wearables and point-of-care devices, to molecular and physiological monitoring. We introduce a precision space health system that will ensure that the future of space health is predictive, preventative, participatory and personalized.

20220014606,PRESENTATION,SPACEFLIGHT ASSOCIATED NEURO-OCULAR SYNDROME (SANS): 2023 CLINICAL UPDATE ,"[""T J Brunstetter"",""S S Mason"",""W F Taiym"",""C R Gibson"",""M Van Baalen"",""W J Tarver""]","INTRODUCTION
Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) is a condition unique to long-duration spaceflight, with an unclear pathogenesis and pathophysiology, and no perfect terrestrial analog. Approximately 66% of long duration spaceflight (LDSF) astronauts present with the earliest indication of SANS, which is defined as development of any
of the following signs in at least one eye during or immediately following spaceflight: 1) optic disc edema (ODE; represented by an increase of ≥ 20 microns in peripapillary total retinal thickness [ΔTRT]); 2) chorioretinal folds; 3) globe flattening; and 4) excessive shift in refractive error (≥ +0.75D). Each of these signs presents potential risk to a
crewmember’s vision and mission effectiveness, with ODE posing the highest risk overall. It is not yet known what severity and/or duration of these signs might lead to acute or permanent impacts to ocular anatomy or visual performance. Brain anatomical changes also occur during long-duration spaceflight and are being monitored in the
astronaut population; however, these changes have not yet been associated with functional decrements or with SANS. An update will be provided on the latest SANS clinical analyses, diagnostics, and program initiatives.
METHODS
Data were obtained from clinical records and SANS subject matter experts (SMEs) to compile a SANS clinical update. Areas of interest include: 1) prevalence of SANS signs, 2) defining clinical thresholds for SANS, and 3) an overview of current and planned SANS clinical efforts.
DISCUSSION
SANS Sign Prevalence: Analysis at the time of this abstract submission indicates that the approximate prevalence of primary SANS findings in USOS LDSF crewmembers is: 64% for ODE (≥ 20-micron ΔTRT), 15% for chorioretinal folds, 26% for globe flattening, and 14% for hyperopic shifts in refractive error (≥ +0.75D).
Clinical Thresholds:
 The Earliest Indication of SANS was presented publicly for the first time at the 2020 NASA Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop. See definition in Introduction section (above).
 Clinically Concerning SANS – Development of any of the following signs during or immediately following spaceflight: 1) ODE (≥ 55-micron ΔTRT* and/or Frisèn grade ≥1*), 2) sharp chorioretinal folds in the vicinity of the macula, or 3) moderate globe flattening.
 Pathological SANS with an Acute Functional Impact – Development of any of the following signs/symptoms during or immediately following spaceflight: 1) visual field loss (e.g., enlarged blindspot), 2) distorted centralvision, or 3) shift in refractive error beyond power of available correction (e.g., “space anticipation glasses”).
 Pathological SANS affecting Long-Term Health – Development of any of the following signs/symptoms during or following spaceflight: 1) permanent visual field loss, 2) reduced retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, 3) permanently distorted central vision, 4) atrophy of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) or photoreceptors, or 5) choroidal neovascularization.
Current & Planned Clinical Efforts (accurate at time of abstract submission): All SANS diagnostic hardware are performing nominally onboard the International Space Station: vision screening, fundoscope, optical coherence tomography (OCT) device, ultrasound, and tonometer. The Goggle-Based Visual Field (GBVF) device is nearing
completion of its clinical validation study at Ohio State University and is planned for parabolic flight testing in fiscal year 2023 (FY23); pending positive results, this sequence may pave the way towards an ISS technology demonstration in FY24.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220014606,""endDate"":""2023-02-09T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""010f04358b3b4e3bb12d8bcb4fd5c2ac"",""id"":""e393773b25174935b73e16334843f7ff""}],""name"":""2023 Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX "",""id"":""010f04358b3b4e3bb12d8bcb4fd5c2ac"",""url"":"""",""startDate"":""2023-02-07T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""609524.07.02.01.01"",""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220014606

Here we present two NASA-selected spaceflight experiments under the TIDES portfolio, iGCE (Integrated Gravity Continuum Experiment) and MitoFlyght (Mitochondrial Investigation of Oxidative Stress in Flies). We hypothesize that exposure to spaceflight conditions induces oxidative stress responses that negatively impact physiology. The iGCE mission employs two well-established spaceflight models, Drosophila melanogaster and C.elegans, using Redwire’s Multi-use Variable-g Platform (MVP) hardware to assess changes in cardiac, muscle, and nervous systems across five different gravities: Hypergravity (2g), Earth (1g), Mars (0.37g), Moon (0.16g), and microgravity (ug). This mission focuses on uncovering alterations in protein homeostasis, autophagy, and mitochondrial function conserved across species. In the MitoFlyght mission to the ISS, Drosophila will be housed in the Vented Fly Box (VFB). This mission evaluates the oxidative stress response and autophagic pathway in muscle, heart, and nervous system. Additionally, we will (a) use the genetic mutant, <i>Tor7/P</i> to test whether increased autophagy is beneficial or a maladaptive response to the spaceflight stressors, and (b) utilize fly lines with tissue-specific expression (neuronal, muscle, and cardiac) of an antioxidant gene, <i>SOD2</i> (superoxide dismutase) as a potential countermeasure. Data from these missions will be compared with previous LEO-based datasets to identify shared signatures. Furthermore, cross-species analysis of the transcriptomic data from other invertebrate and vertebrate spaceflight studies will help determine evolutionarily conserved pathways perturbed by space stressors. Overall, both these missions aim to provide crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying oxidative stress responses, synaptic changes, and heart and muscle deficits, facilitating the identification of diagnostic and therapeutic targets to mitigate the adverse health effects of long-duration space habitation.

Marshall-Bowman""]","Introduction: Current exercise countermeasures on the International Space Station (ISS), including treadmill running, cycle ergometry, and resistive exercise, are used to protect crewmember health and performance during long-duration spaceflight. However, exploration vehicles for Artemis and beyond will have volume and power restrictions, requiring exercise hardware to have a smaller footprint and use fewer resources. Thus, recent efforts have focused on developing exercise devices (such as the European Enhanced Exploration Exercise Device [E4D]) that provide both aerobic and resistive training on one platform without including a treadmill. It is critical to validate the efficacy of exploration-focused exercise modalities to preserve muscle strength, aerobic fitness, bone density, and sensorimotor performance. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the physiological effects of spaceflight that occur with nominal ISS exercise prescriptions compared to exploration-forward exercise modalities to determine if a treadmill is required to maintain current levels of protection during long-duration missions.

Methods: Crewmembers will be assigned to one of three groups: 1) Control Group (n ≥ 40), who will partake in nominal exercise on the ISS, including running on the Treadmill with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization 2 (T2), ergometry on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (CEVIS) device, and strength training on the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED); 2) Active Group 1, who will partake in CEVIS and ARED exercise only (n = 8); and 3) Active Group 2, who will partake in aerobic and resistive exercise on the E4D only (n = 8). For Active Group 1, nominal aerobic exercise on T2 will be replaced with corresponding exercise on CEVIS. For Active Group 2, a dedicated exercise prescription will be designed to maximize the capabilities of the E4D to include resistive exercise, cycle ergometry, rowing, and rope pulling. Crewmembers in both active groups will not be permitted to perform treadmill exercise. Health and performance markers including bone mineral density (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]), body composition (DXA), cardiovascular fitness (cycle VO2peak), muscle strength and endurance (isometric/isokinetic testing, power endurance testing), sensorimotor performance (sit-to-stand, obstacle course), postural control (computerized dynamic posturography), 
Results: Eight subjects (2 Active [CEVIS + ARED], 6 Control) have been recruited for this study. Data collection is currently in progress.

Conclusions: This study will assess the efficacy of exploration exercise modalities, including the effects of removing the treadmill exercise capability or of exclusively using the E4D, compared to nominal ISS exercise across an entire mission on bone, muscle, aerobic, and sensorimotor health and performance. Findings from this study will help provide a recommendation on whether these exploration exercise modalities can sufficiently protect against physiological deconditioning during spaceflight or whether a treadmill may be required to maintain current levels of protection during future exploration class spaceflight missions.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230000790,""endDate"":""2023-02-09T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""04913d0495484f948cff1f858abd1c0b"",""id"":""8f9d41d6aacf40e180dfd67c54dd8501""}],""name"":""2023 Human Research Program (HRP) Investigators’ Workshop (IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""04913d0495484f948cff1f858abd1c0b"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/08d8f955-514e-4e10-b860-bd009811ec13/summary"",""startDate"":""2023-02-07T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.03.01.32.2161""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20230013483,""title"":""Effects of Replacing Treadmill Running with Alternative Exercise Countermeasures During Long-Duration Spaceflight""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230000790

[1] studied the cognitive demands of human sensorimotor performance and dual tasking during long duration missions and concluded that both stress and scarcity of cognitive resources required for sensorimotor adaptation may be responsible for these deficits during spaceflight. Therefore, in consideration of the health and performance of crewmembers in- and post-flight, we are conducting this study to investigate the effects of spaceflight on the extent, longevity and neural bases of sensorimotor, cognitive, and neural changes. The data presented will focus on the behavioral measures that were collected pre-, in- and post-flight including spatial cognition, processing speed, bimanual coordination, functional mobility, computerized dynamic posturography (CDP), and vibrotactile induced vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP). To date, data were collected over the course of two pre-flight sessions and four post-flight sessions on five crewmembers (n=13) using the protocol described in Koppelmans et al. [2]. Balance control was assessed using CDP, with eyes closed and a sway-referenced base of support (Sensory Organization Test 5), with and without head movements in the pitch plane. Spatial working memory was assessed using Thurston's Card Rotation Test and a Mental Rotation Test. The Rod and Frame Test was performed to test visual dependence. The Digit Symbol Substitution Test was performed to evaluate processing speed, and the Purdue Pegboard Task was performed to test bimanual coordination. Vestibular function was assessed by eliciting ocular VEMP via a hand held striker on the side of the head as subjects lay supine on a gurney. Subjects also performed the Functional Mobility Test of walking through an obstacle course to assess rate of early motor learning. Data were also collected on the same crewmembers during three in-flight sessions on the International Space Station (ISS). In-flight, spatial working memory was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test, adaptation to visuo-motor transformation in manual control was assessed using the Sensorimotor Adaptation Test, and multi-tasking ability was assessed using the Dual Task Test. These three tests were performed in a strapped-in configuration mimicking a seated position - waist bungees pulled the crewmember toward the ""floor"" with feet secured in foot loops.

The molecular mechanisms under pinning innate immune defense can be confounded by the complexity of the acquired immune system of humans. Drosophila (fruit fly) innate immunity is simpler, and shares many similarities with human innate immunity at the level of molecular and genetic pathways. The goals of this study were to elucidate fundamental immune processes in Drosophila affected by spaceflight and to measure host-pathogen responses post-flight. Five containers, each containing ten female and five male fruit flies, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours. A new generation of flies was reared in microgravity. In larvae, the immune system was examined by analyzing plasmatocyte number and activity in culture. In adults, the induced immune responses were analyzed by bacterial clearance and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of selected genes following infection with E. coli. The RNA levels of relevant immune pathway genes were determined in both larvae and adults by microarray analysis. The ability of larval plasmatocytes to phagocytose E. coli in culture was attenuated following spaceflight, and in parallel, the expression of genes involved in cell maturation was down regulated. In addition, the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of lysozymes, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity, were also reduced in larvae. In adults, the efficiency of bacterial clearance measured in vivo following a systemic infection with E. coli post-flight, remained robust. We show that spaceflight altered both cellular and humoral immune responses in Drosophila and that the disruption occurs at multiple interacting pathways.","[{""submissionId"":20180007263,""id"":""725bd51ddc824f938812e1b065bd22bc"",""publicationDate"":""2014-02-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180007263,""endDate"":""2014-02-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ed97837929414b3fbd11a407c40f39e3"",""id"":""bac0f34abbe44c85b2a47f20406fba6d""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP 2014)"",""location"":""Glaveston, TX"",""id"":""ed97837929414b3fbd11a407c40f39e3"",""startDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNX10AI34A"",""NAS2-02090""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180007263

Space flight presents additional hazards and associated risks to crew health, performance, and safety. With an extended human presence in space it is expected that illness and injury will occur on orbit, which may present a significant threat to crew health and performance and to mission success. Maintaining crew health, safety and performance and preventing illness and injury are high priorities necessary for mission success and agency goals. Space flight health care should meet the standards of practice of evidence based clinical medicine. The function of Space Medicine is expected to meet the agency goals as stated in the 1998 NASA Strategic Plan and the priorities established by the Critical Path Roadmap Project. The Critical Path Roadmap Project is an integrated NASA cross-disciplinary strategy to assess, understand, mitigate, and manage the risks associated with long-term exposure to the space flight environment. The evidence based approach to space medicine should be standardized, objective process yielding expected results and establishing clinical practice standards while balancing individual risk with mission (programmatic) risk. The ability to methodically apply available knowledge and expertise to individual and mission health issues will ensure appropriate priorities are assigned and resources are allocated. NASA Space Medicine risk management process is a combined clinical and engineering approach. Competition for weight, power, volume, cost, and crew time must be balanced in making decisions about the care of individual crew with competing agency resources.","[{""submissionId"":20010085806,""id"":""f80307121b004a5fb9f6329c6e0d4e66"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings from the 2001 NASA Occupational Health Conference: Risk Assessment and Management in 2001"",""publicationDate"":""2001-05-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20010085800,""title"":""Proceedings from the 2001 NASA Occupational Health Conference: Risk Assessment and Management in 2001""},{""id"":20010085800,""title"":""Proceedings from the 2001 NASA Occupational Health Conference: Risk Assessment and Management in 2001""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20010085806

Faced with the obstacle of access to in-flight medical care, and limitations of vehicle space, time, and communications; it is necessary to prioritize what medical consumables are manifested for the flight, and which medical conditions are addressed. Studies of astronaut health establish the incidence of common and high risk medical conditions that require medical intervention during long-duration exploration missions. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) convened a committee of experts, Committee on Creating a Vision for Space Medicine during Travel beyond Earth Orbit, to examine the issues surrounding astronaut health and safety for long duration space missions. Two themes run throughout the committee's final report: (1) that not enough is known about the risks to human health during long-duration missions beyond Earth's orbit or about what can effectively mitigate those risks to enable humans to travel and work safely in the environment of deep space and (2) that everything reasonable should be done to gain the necessary information before humans are sent on missions of space exploration (IOM, 2001). Although several spaceflight focused pharmaceutical research studies have been conducted, few have provided sufficient data regarding medication usage or potency changes during spaceflight. The Du pharmaceutical stability study assessed medications flown on space shuttles to and from the International Space Station (ISS) from 2006 until 2008; of which some medications were still viable beyond their expiration dates (Du et al, 2011). However, as with many spaceflight studies, the small 'n' associated with this study limits the ability to draw strong conclusions from it. Dr. Wotring and others have recently published articles containing information regarding medication usage, indications, and efficacy gleaned from spaceflight records (Wotring et al, 2015, 2016; Barger et al, 2014; Basner and Dinges, 2014). Although some conclusions can be drawn from these studies, the inability to fully quantify medication usage, indications, side effects, and effectiveness, limits insight as to which medications should be prioritized for further research.","[{""submissionId"":20170001651,""id"":""db51049a2e804fc088cbc4382ecfa5fb"",""publicationDate"":""2016-09-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170001651,""name"":""Pharmaceutical Panel Expert Meeting"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""4cad3e847d91477096ec8e4c0ecf6cf3"",""startDate"":""2017-03-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170001651

INTRODUCTION
Over the past 50 years, microorganisms have displayed unexpected responses relevant to infectious disease when grown in microgravity and microgravity analogue environments, including changes in final cell concentration, biofilm production, stress resistance, antibiotic sensitivity, gene expression, and virulence. In parallel, astronaut studies have characterized a persistent spaceflight-induced dysregulation of the human immune system; consisting of altered leukocyte distribution, reductions in T and NK cell function, altered cytokine profiles, and reactivation of latent herpesviruses. Further, astronauts have some degree of clinical incidence, primarily infectious disease episodes and atopic dermatitis. The impact of the microgravity environment on host-pathogen interactions and potential for clinical disease remains understudied and poorly characterized. 

SPECIFIC AIMS
In the Host-Microorganism, Microbial Response aspect of this study, the following Specific Aims are being investigated, using the microbial pathogens, Salmonella enterica Enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli.

Aim 1: Characterize the effect of spaceflight analogue culture on microbial pathogenesis-related stress responses and in vitro host-pathogen interactions. Analysis will include microbial stress responses as well as colonization and viability following pathogen challenge of three-dimensional (3-D) tissue co-culture models containing immune cells. We specifically selected obligate and opportunistic pathogens that are medically important and have been or are likely to be found aboard spacecraft.

Aim 2: Characterize the effect of spaceflight analogue culture on the virulence potential of pathogenic microorganisms. Changes in virulence will be assessed using a mouse model of infection. 

SIGNIFICANCE
The goal of this study is to use spaceflight analogue conditions to gain insight into the breadth of medically-significant International Space Station microorganisms that have altered virulence and the impact of those changes on the immune response of the host, including astronaut immune cells. This information will provide critical understanding into the impact of microgravity on potential alterations in microbial virulence and associated infectious disease risk to crew health during spaceflight missions.

20240011648,ABSTRACT,Seeing the Future of Spaceflight: Applications of Extended Reality (XR) Technologies,"[""Yevgeniy Zhivotovskiy"",""Michael J Matthews"",""Shean E Phelps"",""Emily R Stratton"",""Josef F Schmid""]","INTRODUCTION
Advances in Earth Independent Medical Operations (EIMO) focused capabilities will be crucial for completing successful beyond low-earth-orbit (LEO) missions, where traditional Earth-based medical support and near real-time communication are limited, intermittent, or absent. In such restricted or limited communication environments, emerging extended reality (ER or XR) technologies may play a vital role in ensuring crew health and safety. Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) are common terms used to describe technologies that ""generate or modify"" while “extended reality” (ER or XR) is often used as an umbrella term for these technologies. This review explores how such cutting-edge “extended reality” information delivery systems are currently applied across various disciplines within NASA. The review focuses on their capabilities, limitations, and prospective future applications as they pertain to Earth-Independent Medical Operations and its components of pre-mission planning, medical decision making, resource management, and task load management. 

METHODS/DESIGN
The review began with a literature search to identify relevant disciplines (e.g., medical education, austere environments) where XR technologies have been studied to highlight areas where evidence is lacking. Previous and current NASA XR projects and applications, as well as commercial partnerships, such as those with Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), were identified. Discussions with technical experts involved in the design, development, and application of these technologies allowed for classification based on their respective spaceflight applications.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
This review highlights current and emerging XR technologies that have been developed, tested, and implemented both terrestrially and in spaceflight by NASA, its international partners, the U.S. Armed Forces, and various relevant commercial entities. While these novel information delivery systems vary in their respective technology readiness levels (TRL), they have the potential to be implemented on Earth, in LEO, and during deep space exploration. These systems have the potential for impacting and optimizing many aspects of EIMO.

It is also hypothesized to be expedited during spaceflight due to elevated oxidative stress. In conjunction with increased pathogenicity of bacteria in microgravity, accelerated thymic involution may present additional health risks to astronauts as NASA pursues human spaceflight outside of Low Earth Orbit (LEO). We analyzed the impacts of spaceflight on gene expression in the mouse thymus using the GeneLab Galaxy platform and transcriptomics data from the GLDS-289 study titled: “Impact of Spaceflight on Gene Expression in the Thymus”. This study investigated thymic atrophy in three groups of mice: spaceflight, artificial gravity during spaceflight, and ground controls. Our analysis of differentially expressed genes and involved pathways, using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and volcano plots, indicated a downregulation of histone genes H2AC11 and H2AC21 as well as cyclin genes CDK1 and CDC25 in the spaceflight group relative to ground controls. We hypothesize that decreased expression of these genes leads to reduced thymic epithelial cell proliferation and decreased T cell maturation. We developed a proposal for a series of experiments to test our hypothesis; RNA sequencing and Western blot analyses will be used to examine the relationship between thymic involution and these four genes as they are silenced in developing mouse thymic organoids. Our proposal thus serves as a first step towards advancing our understanding of the impacts of microgravity on thymic cell proliferation and maturation, and more broadly, adaptive immune system functions in space with the goal to support astronaut and terrestrial health.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220014208,""endDate"":""2022-11-12T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""cb25efa7aea64aedaa4a04a2f9c71d76"",""id"":""e15ca73ffd8e4cacb7dc9c42d9dfcc72""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""cb25efa7aea64aedaa4a04a2f9c71d76"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2022-meeting/"",""startDate"":""2022-11-09T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.07.01.02.02""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220014208

20240014873,ABSTRACT,Standardized Multidisciplinary Research of Crew Health and Performance Generates Robust Evidence for Monitoring and Informed Decision Making,"[""John G Hardy"",""Corey A Theriot""]","Background:  Space medicine professionals face numerous challenges when making critical decisions on how to best manage a crewmember’s health and performance often relying on both subject matter expertise and evidence from biomedical research to inform their decisions. However, biomedical research in the space environment is regularly met with several inherent limitations including small sample sizes, disciplinary siloing, and highly variable crew research compliments. To overcome these barriers and address the need for rigorous research data, many space programs have developed multidisciplinary studies with a wider scope of investigation that is reproducible across missions, NASA’s Human Research Program’s Standard Measures study is an example of such efforts.

Overview: The Spaceflight Standard Measures study is an integrated research compliment that monitors spaceflight adaptions across multiple physiological and psychological domains. The study was developed by the Human Research Program in 2017 to monitor high priority human system risks and provide context for concurrent experiments. Each of the six scientific disciplines comprising the study contain a minimal set of previously validated measures that are repeatedly collected throughout all three mission phases. To date, 35 professional astronauts have completed the study, generating a rich dataset of over 100,000 data points. This dataset is accessible to space medicine and research professional for both scientific and clinical inquiries.
              
Results from a linear mixed effect model provides an example of how a longitudinal dataset can be used by researchers and space medicine professionals to inform their decision making. The data of over 30 astronauts was pooled together and an analysis performed on variables of two scientific disciplines: nutritional biochemistry and cellular profile (immunology and virology). The results of the analysis identified differences in how individuals adapt to spaceflight and how crewmember demographics (i.e. age, sex) and mission design (i.e flight duration) affect these responses.

Discussion: Commentary on the practical application of results from the Spaceflight Standard Measures study for the monitoring of crew health and performance is discussed. Finally, resources on how and where clinicians and research professionals can access standard measures data is provided to further support the space medicine community.

20150003035,ABSTRACT,Human Factors and Habitability Challenges for Mars Missions,"[""Whitmore, Mihriban""]","As NASA is planning to send humans deeper into space than ever before, adequate crew health and performance will be critical for mission success. Within the NASA Human Research Program (HRP), the Space Human Factors and Habitability (SHFH) team is responsible for characterizing the risks associated with human capabilities and limitations with respect to long-duration spaceflight, and for providing mitigations (e.g., guidelines, technologies, and tools) to promote safe, reliable and productive missions. SHFH research includes three domains: Advanced Environmental Health (AEH), Advanced Food Technology (AFT), and Space Human Factors Engineering (SHFE). The AEH portfolio focuses on understanding the risk of microbial contamination of the spacecraft and on the development of standards for exposure to potential toxins such as chemicals, bacteria, fungus, and lunar/Martian dust. The two risks that the environmental health project focuses on are adverse health effects due to changes in host-microbe interactions, and risks associated with exposure to dust in planetary surface habitats. This portfolio also proposes countermeasures to these risks by making recommendations that relate to requirements for environmental quality, foods, and crew health on spacecraft and space missions. The AFT portfolio focuses on reducing the mass, volume, and waste of the entire integrated food system to be used in exploration missions, and investigating processing methods to extend the shelf life of food items up to five years, while assuring that exploration crews will have nutritious and palatable foods. The portfolio also delivers improvements in both the food itself and the technologies for storing and preparing it. SHFE sponsors research to establish human factors and habitability standards and guidelines in five risk areas, and provides improved design concepts for advanced crew interfaces and habitability systems. These risk areas include: Incompatible vehicle/habitat design, inadequate human-computer interaction, inadequate critical task design, inadequate human-automation/robotic interaction, and performance errors due to training deficiencies. To address the identified research gaps within each risk, SHFH's research plan includes studies in the laboratory, in analogs, and on International Space Station (ISS). In addition to establishing and maintaining the risk-based research portfolio, SHFH is also implementing a qualitative approach to determine how we at NASA evaluate human performance. Via interviews with experts, such as trainers, flight controllers, and flight surgeons, we are collecting the metrics by which they assess human performance, evidence of performance issues, and potential or actual consequences. The Human Performance Data Project will determine what human performance data have been collected in the past at NASA, and what data should be collected in the future in order to complete our knowledgebase and reduce risks related to human factors and habitability.","[{""submissionId"":20150003035,""id"":""a0e017aeba4d45ec8e69523c0b5a7efd"",""publicationDate"":""2015-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Czechoslovakia"",""submissionId"":20150003035,""endDate"":""2015-07-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Humans in Space Symposium (HIS)"",""location"":""Prague"",""id"":""9a07ac2f63a545e0be567d4c69b4eab6"",""startDate"":""2015-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150003035
20210012820,PRESENTATION,Human Capabilities Assessments for Autonomous Missions: A Multi-Team Research Effort to Reduce Risk in the Human-System Integration Architecture for Future Deep-Space Missions,"[""Stephen K Robinson"",""Brian F Gore"",""Alexandra M Whitmire""]","In future exploration missions beyond low earth-orbit, crew will have to execute complex operations and respond to off-nominal events, without real-time support from Mission Control. It is anticipated that increased reliance on automated systems, including human-centric vehicle and information architecture, will need to be designed to support the crew; increased risk to performance, health, and safety may occur if these are not implemented appropriately. The Human Factors and Behavioral Performance Element (HFBP) in the NASA Human Research Program supports research to characterize and mitigate such human health and performance risks, including the Risk of Adverse Outcome Due to Inadequate Human Systems Integration Architecture (HSIA). 
The HSIA risk addresses the integration of onboard capability and the crew roles and responsibilities necessary to enable the crew to respond effectively and efficiently in the increasingly autonomous mission operations environment. In 2017, HFBP released the “Human Capabilities Assessments for Autonomous Missions” (HCAAM) research topic to address HSIA related questions. HCAAM is a major NASA research effort that has assembled a multidisciplinary team from seven institutions to work closely with design and engineering efforts on research towards developing and refining human performance standards, guidelines and automation tools. The scientific focus is on quantitative assessment of human capabilities relevant to future deep-space missions during which earth/spacecraft communication is so delayed and intermittent that the crew must be able to function autonomously.

The integrated strategy of the HCAAM project characterizes human capabilities and limitations related to potential performance decrements during long duration exploration mission spaceflight as relevant to both routine and complex task performance; defines system characteristics that reduce the likelihood or impact of potential decrements in human performance capabilities; performs integrated assessment of intelligent system responses within the context of an operational environment with relevant NASA tools, systems, and data structures in order to determine positive or negative interactions and validate recommended approaches; and proposes specific updates to existing standards and guidelines for inclusion in NASA handbooks for the design of future spacecraft intelligent systems that provide crew performance assessment/feedback, and to also serve as decision-support aids for the onboard crew (i.e., NASA-STD-3001, and NASA/SP-Human Integration Design Handbook (HIDH)). 

The scientific research vectors being addressed by the seven HCAAM teams include: 
-	crew task performance (accuracy, efficiency) (crew + automation)
-	crew performance (accuracy, efficiency)
-	crew Situation Awareness
-	procedure design and multi-modal enhancement
-	concurrent tasking (mixed manual + some level of autonomy)
-	task handover
-	crew self-planning and time-lining
-	task design
-	trust in automation, real-time calibration
-	human multi-sensory feedback and guidance
-	human trust in on-board software-based intelligent assistants
-	virtual assistants

20250000644,PRESENTATION,The Future of Integrated Performance Modeling in the Crew Health and Performance – Probabilistic Risk Assessment Project ,"[""Lauren McIntyre"",""Mona Matar"",""Drayton W Munster"",""Jerry G Myers""]","The NASA engineering community utilizes event-driven and fault-tree probabilistic techniques to classify risks in the space environment by taking advantage of the inherent knowledge of complex spaceflight system design and testing to quantify failure risk. In harmonizing the risk of human space flight, answering the question of ‘How do we balance health, performance and resource risks with other engineering risks on long duration space missions?’ remains a deeply challenging and largely qualitative practice. The Human Research Program’s Medical Extensible Dynamic Probabilistic Risk Assessment Tool (MEDPRAT) was a significant step forward in efforts to robustly quantify the risk to crew health for exploration missions. However, there remains a significant gap in the ability to comprehensively assess and characterize risk across the disparate functionalities and capabilities which comprise the Crew Health and Performance (CHP) system.

The Crew Health and Performance – Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CHP-PRA) project seeks to characterize CHP risks by expanding beyond the foundation established by its PRA predecessors like IMM and MEDPRAT, that simulate medical risk metrics like loss of crew life and evacuations. One of the new risk measures in the CHP-PRA system is embodied in our Performance Risk Model (PRisM). PRisM provides a novel way of assessing crew performance on mission tasks, using a generalized framework which relates back to NASA-STD-3001. This approach allows PRisM to capture and integrate data from a variety of different domains into a single, unified, reproducible representation of astronaut performance. 

In this presentation, we discuss the motivation for the CHP-PRA work and give a high level overview of the goals of the project, outline the forward work for PRisM, and discuss collaboration opportunities for the community who might explore if their domain knowledge and data could be represented, integrated, and quantified with these tools, whose outcomes are metrics useful for supporting operational mission planning and decision making.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20250000644,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d40aa208d43649b3bc01d482185543cd"",""id"":""7daee8d5911942c0820ff5538f31754a""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""d40aa208d43649b3bc01d482185543cd"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""305041.01.02.10""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250000644
20250000722,POSTER,"Innovative Drug Selection, Storage, and Shelf-Life Strategies for Exploration Spaceflight","[""Vernie R Daniels"",""Edward S Williams""]","Medications have been a part of space travel dating back to the Apollo missions. A safe and effective medication formulary is essential to maintaining crew health and performance during long-duration spaceflight outside of low Earth orbit (LEO). Distance from Earth creates four key operational changes that increase medical risks, including communication, resupply, crewmember health, and evacuation. The current spaceflight pharmaceutical formulary consists of medications indicated to treat a variety of anticipated medical events and healthcare needs during spaceflight, but depends on a robust consumables resupply chain, which may be strained for a Lunar, and possibly non-existent for a Mars mission. The specific medications selections for the formulary may change to optimally align with the mission, crew compliment, and spacecraft design. Medical support at long-duration exploration missions will differ from LEO missions due to mission duration, lack of consumables resupply, prolonged exposure to space radiation, and the absence of emergency medical return capability. Loss of medication resupply limits or removes the ability to replace medications that have been exhausted or degraded, potentially exacerbating the medical risk posture. To address these anticipated risks, long-duration missions must consider use of novel medical technologies, treatment modalities, and smart medical systems that offer greater crew autonomy, such as physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, drug repurposing, on demand drug synthesis, or wearable drug delivery / monitoring devices. Once an ideal formulary for exploration space is determined, it is essential to establish the chemical and physical stability of each medication compound, as well as its safety by identifying its degradation profiles and products. Although few studies have been conducted to provide evidence on the physicochemical stability of pharmaceuticals during space missions, the data suggests that the spaceflight environment may promote degradation in some pharmaceuticals. Formulary drug purity and efficacy should be verified by pharmaceutical stability assessments, and can be realized non-destructively, and accessed in remote environments. Non-destructive pharmaceutical analysis and statistical modelling techniques could optimize exploration spaceflight medical care by enabling early detection of suboptimal therapeutics. Likewise, novel packaging, storage strategies, and dosage form innovations are promising countermeasures to optimize pharmaceutical shelf life, purity, and quality of exploration spaceflight medications. As we prepare for more distant exploration missions, risk management planning for astronaut healthcare should include the assembly of a medication formulary that is comprehensive enough to prevent or treat anticipated medical events, remains safe and chemically stable, and retains sufficient potency to last for the duration of the mission. Following extensive review of the literature, we will present innovative formulary optimization strategies, pharmaceutical stability assessment techniques, and storage and packaging solutions that could enhance drug safety and efficacy for future exploration spaceflight missions.","[{""submissionId"":20250000722,""publisher"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""id"":""595cc6b9e9c6432b89ecd1729bb9f9df"",""publicationDate"":""2025-01-28T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20250000722,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""19a0b3bd1e65495fb5d79000139f4081"",""id"":""46b3879803f648dcaf10c17c20daaca7""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""19a0b3bd1e65495fb5d79000139f4081"",""url"":""https://www.nasa.gov/hrp/iws-2025/"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250000722

20220000142,PRESENTATION,Effects of Spaceflight Relevant Carbon Dioxide Levels on Pathogenesis Related Microbial Characteristics,"[""A A Medina-Colorado"",""C A Nickerson "",""C M Ott""]","BACKGROUND Multiple stressors in the spaceflight environment have the potential to alter microbial pathogenesis and virulence characteristics, including microgravity, radiation, and hostile/confined conditions. This combination of factors may lead to a stacking of risks, potentially creating unexpected increase in the risk of infectious disease. One understudied variable is the higher CO2 atmospheric concentration. The current Spaceflight Maximum Allowance Concentration (SMAC) for 24-hour average CO2 is 0.4% (3 mm Hg). These elevated ambient CO2 levels aboard the ISS could potentially influence the diversity and phenotypic responses of the resident microbial communities from both the spacecraft environment (air, surface, water) and crewmembers (gut, nasal, skin microbiomes).  

METHODS For these studies, we will evaluate the response of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes, which are opportunistic pathogens that are of medical significance and have been or are likely to be found aboard spacecraft.  These microorganisms will be cultured in both spaceflight analog and control conditions at CO2levels representing terrestrial atmospheric concentration of 0.04% (0.3 mmHg), ISS elevated concentration of 0.4% (3 mm Hg), and an unexpected elevated concentration of 1 % (7.6 mmHg) to represent a worst case scenario. 

DISCUSSION Overwhelming evidence from studies performed in food microbiology, marine biology and terrestrial environmental biology suggest altered gene expression, selective bacterial inhibition, increased growth and diversity, and increased antibiotic resistance of bacterial communities individually and in biofilm formation when exposed to increased levels of CO2. While many of these findings are based on levels of CO2 higher than would be found during spaceflight exploration missions, the potential for subtle changes in CO2 levels to exacerbate infectious disease risks warrants an evaluation of pathogen responses to spaceflight CO2 conditions. Our study will provide answers to spaceflight relevant atmospheric conditions, as described in the Risk of Adverse Health Effects Due to Host-Microorganism Interaction (GapMicro 103).

Currently, assessing the potential crew health risk associated with a microbial contamination event requires return of representative environmental samples that are analyzed in a ground-based laboratory. It is therefore not currently possible to quickly identify microbes during spaceflight. This project addresses the unmet need for spaceflight-compatible microbial identification technology. The electrochemical detection and identification platform is expected to provide a sensitive, specific, and rapid sample-to-answer capability for in-flight microbial monitoring that can distinguish between related microorganisms (pathogens and non-pathogens) as well as chemical contaminants. This will dramatically enhance our ability to monitor the spacecraft environment and the health risk to the crew. Further, the project is expected to eliminate the need for sample return while significantly reducing crew time required for detection of multiple targets. Initial work will focus on the optimization of bacterial detection and identification. The platform is designed to release nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) from microorganisms without the use of harmful chemicals. Bacterial DNA or RNA is captured by bacteria-specific probe molecules that are bound to a microelectrode, and that capture event can generate a small change in the electrical current (Lam, et al. 2012. Anal. Chem. 84(1): 21-5.). This current is measured, and a determination is made whether a given microbe is present in the sample analyzed. Chemical detection can be accomplished by directly applying a sample to the microelectrode and measuring the resulting current change. This rapid microbial and chemical detection device is designed to be a low-cost, low-power platform anticipated to be operated independently of an external power source, characteristics optimal for manned spaceflight and areas where power and computing resources are scarce.","[{""submissionId"":20140007279,""id"":""3bbdf544c9474df3ad549fa6ea00afa0"",""publicationDate"":""2014-04-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140007279

Plants grown in the Veggie and APH units on the ISS currently provide the astronauts with a hefty dose of vitamins and minerals, but some nutrients could be improved. Agronomic Biofortifcation of crops with fertilizers has been tested on Earth, with the successful addition of minerals and vitamin C to crops that have otherwise been deficient. We intend to test if we can replicate this in a controlled environment and expand it to nutrients that are not often present in abundance in plants. This will be done by adding fluid nutrient blends to the water supply of candidate crops for spaceflight applications. We hypothesize that fertilization of plants with nutrients that are of value to human health will have neutral to positive effect on plants, with desired nutrients present in greater abundance in treated plants than untreated plants. We intend to show this through germination percent and pace, yield of edible biomass, the growth rate, and overall development of the crop plant. For this experiment, radish microgreens were grown on mats in a controlled environment chamber in enriched CO2, with LED lighting similar to what is found in the ISS Veggie hardware. Watering was conducted once at planting with a specialized blend of ½ strength Hoagland’s hydroponic solution with additional vitamins.

IMM simulation outcomes describing the impact of medical events on the mission may be used to optimize the allocation of resources in medical kits. Efficient allocation of medical resources, subject to certain mass and volume constraints, is crucial to ensuring the best outcomes of in-flight medical events. We implement a new approach to this medical kit optimization problem. METHODS We frame medical kit optimization as a modified knapsack problem and implement an algorithm utilizing a dynamic programming technique. Using this algorithm, optimized medical kits were generated for 3 different mission scenarios with the goal of minimizing the probability of evacuation and maximizing the Crew Health Index (CHI) for each mission subject to mass and volume constraints. Simulation outcomes using these kits were also compared to outcomes using kits optimized..RESULTS The optimized medical kits generated by the algorithm described here resulted in predicted mission outcomes more closely approached the unlimited-resource scenario for Crew Health Index (CHI) than the implementation in under all optimization priorities. Furthermore, the approach described here improves upon in reducing evacuation when the optimization priority is minimizing the probability of evacuation.

The Gram-negative pathogen Serratia marcescens has been shown to potentially cause significant infections in humans and in insect models on Earth. Our recent findings also showed that S. marcescens shows an increase in virulence after a short period of growth in the spaceflight environment, which raises initiatives to find the correlation between space environment and the increased virulence. Because we know that the health of astronauts is immunocompromised in space, it is possible that the combination of increased bacterial virulence and the weakened immune system will cause astronauts to be more susceptible to chronic diseases in extended spaceflight. With 75% of human disease genes being conserved in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, these insects act as an ideal model organism to study the human immune system. The high accessibility, low cost, high rate of reproductivity, and short lifespans of D. melanogaster facilitate efficient, high-quality research that seeks to understand altered virulence of this opportunistic pathogen. In this ground-based study, we will use a rotating wall vessel apparatus to simulate microgravity and determine how pathogenicity changes by evaluating differences in gene expression for S. marcescens between bacteria grown in simulated microgravity conditions and controls. We will compare the results of our findings to gene expression patterns in actual spaceflight samples of S. marcescens grown on the ISS (International Space Station) during a recent validation mission, to see if there are common mechanisms across our simulated microgravity and actual spaceflight microgravity samples that both show increased virulence in the fruit fly. With extended space travel in the foreseeable future, understanding how human physiology will be affected by these different factors will help mitigate risks and deaths.","[{""submissionId"":20180007523,""id"":""ee8fd195f43847a1bcb27db89f32cc60"",""publicationDate"":""2018-10-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20180007523,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States"",""id"":""7621a2d941f1484c9929ea63ec8357ed""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180007523,""endDate"":""2018-11-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""e494297eccef44748c47ce70a5f610ae"",""id"":""2bffc3531be24b62a7c53088d3db6443""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD"",""id"":""e494297eccef44748c47ce70a5f610ae"",""startDate"":""2018-10-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNH15CO48B"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180007523

The process is mediated by changes in prostaglandin release, secondary to the decrease in tension on the affected muscles. On missions, where there is a high level of physical demands on the astronauts, there tends to be an energy deficit, which adds to the muscle protein loss and depletes the body fat reserves. While the adaptive response is a normal part of homeostasis, the additional protein loss from an energy deficit can, in the long run, have a negative effect on health and capability of humans to live and work in space and afterward return to Earth.","[{""volume"":""7"",""submissionId"":20040141682,""issn"":""1569-2574"",""id"":""ed4e0989af1d4d38934fce813a023ff5"",""publicationName"":""Advances in space biology and medicine"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040141682

Marshall-Goebel""]","Introduction: Current exercise countermeasures on the International Space Station (ISS), including treadmill running, cycle ergometry, and resistive exercise, are used to protect crewmember health and performance during long-duration spaceflight. However, exploration vehicles for Artemis and beyond will have volume and power restrictions, requiring exercise hardware to have a smaller footprint and use fewer resources. Thus, recent efforts have focused on developing exercise devices that provide both aerobic and resistive training on one platform without including a treadmill, such as the European Enhanced Exploration Exercise Device (E4D). It is critical to validate the efficacy of exploration-focused exercise modalities to preserve muscle strength, aerobic fitness, bone density, and sensorimotor performance. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the physiological effects of spaceflight that occur with nominal ISS exercise prescriptions compared to exploration-forward exercise modalities to determine if a treadmill is required to maintain current levels of protection during long-duration missions.

Methods:  Crewmembers will be assigned to one of three groups: 1) Control Group (n ≥ 40) who will partake in nominal exercise on the ISS, including running on the treadmill with vibration isolation system 2 (T2), ergometry on the cycle ergometer with vibration isolation and stabilization device (CEVIS), and strength training on the advanced resistive exercise device (ARED); 2) Active Group 1, who will partake in CEVIS and ARED exercise only (n = 8); and 3) Active Group 2, who will partake in aerobic and resistive exercise on the E4D only (n = 8). For Active Group 1, nominal aerobic exercise on T2 will be replaced with corresponding exercise on CEVIS. For Active Group 2, a dedicated exercise prescription will be designed to maximize the capabilities of the E4D to include resistive exercise, cycle ergometry, rowing, and rope pulling. Crewmembers in both active groups will not be permitted to perform treadmill exercise. Health and performance markers including bone mineral density (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]), body composition (DXA), cardiovascular fitness (cycle VO2peak), muscle strength and endurance (isometric/isokinetic testing, power endurance testing), sensorimotor performance (sit-to-stand, obstacle course), postural control (computerized dynamic posturography), and blood and urine biochemical markers of bone metabolism will be assessed before, during, and following spaceflight.

Results: Data collection for this study is currently in progress.

Conclusions: This study will assess the efficacy of exploration exercise modalities, including the effects of removing the treadmill exercise capability or of exclusively using the E4D, compared to nominal ISS exercise across an entire mission on bone, muscle, aerobic, and sensorimotor health and performance. Findings from this study will help provide a recommendation on whether these exploration exercise modalities can sufficiently protect against physiological deconditioning during spaceflight or whether a treadmill may be required to maintain current levels of protection during future exploration class spaceflight missions.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220014282,""endDate"":""2023-02-09T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""31b7a51d51a142479c668662aba47604"",""id"":""e1ad5e52835b4e1298cf293aa079b388""}],""name"":""2023 Human Research Program (HRP) Investigators’ Workshop (IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""31b7a51d51a142479c668662aba47604"",""url"":""https://www.cvent.com/c/abstracts/6c66b149-d763-4180-aed9-784f2773e5be"",""startDate"":""2023-02-07T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.01.01.08.1539""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220014282

20160014865,ABSTRACT,Next Steps Toward Understanding Human Habitation of Space: Environmental Impacts and Mechanisms,"[""Globus, Ruth""]","Entry into low earth orbit and beyond causes profound shifts in environmental conditions that have the potential to influence human productivity, long term health, and even survival. We now have evidence that microgravity, radiation and/or confinement in space can lead to demonstrably detrimental changes in the cardiovascular (e.g. vessel function, orthostatic intolerance), musculoskeletal (muscle atrophy, bone loss) and nervous (eye, neurovestibular) systems of astronauts. Because of both the limited number of astronauts who have flown (especially females) and the high degree of individual variability in the human population, important unanswered questions about responses to the space environment remain: What are the sex differences with respect to specific physiological systems? Are the responses age-dependent and/or reversible after return to Earth? Do observed detrimental changes that resemble accelerated aging progress continuously over time or plateau? What are the mechanisms of the biological responses? Answering these important questions certainly demands a multi-pronged approach, and the study of multicellular model organisms (such as rodents and flies) already has provided opportunities for exploring those questions in some detail. Recent long duration spaceflight experiments with rodents show that mice in space provide a mammalian model that uniquely combines the influence of reduced gravitational loading with increased physical activity. In addition, multiple investigators have shown that ground-based models that simulate aspects of spaceflight (including rodent hind limb unloading to mimic weightlessness and exposure to ionizing radiation), cause various transient and persistent detrimental consequences in multiple physiological systems. In general, we have found that adverse skeletal effects of simulated weightlessness and space radiation when combined, can be quantitatively, if not qualitatively, different from the influence of each environmental factor alone implying at least some shared underlying mechanisms. Thus, both ground based and spaceflight research utilizing model organisms provide the opportunity to better understand environmental factors and biological mechanisms that contribute to human health and survival in space.","[{""submissionId"":20160014865,""id"":""a77f7a1dae3c40918407902fd02f0302"",""publicationDate"":""2016-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160014865,""endDate"":""2016-10-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""c4c6527aca544cddb22005e8fe34cdde"",""id"":""e20bf972a9294438b1a8cf8c267c3d4a""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH"",""id"":""c4c6527aca544cddb22005e8fe34cdde"",""startDate"":""2016-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""},{""submissionId"":20160014865,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States"",""id"":""229e519e6b594d85aa6afe46ce8363f2""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160014865
20120002675,PRESENTATION,Molecular Mechanisms of Circadian Regulation During Spaceflight,"[""Zanello, S. B."",""Boyle, R.""]","The physiology of both vertebrates and invertebrates follows internal rhythms coordinated in phase with the 24-hour daily light cycle. This circadian clock is governed by a central pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain. However, peripheral circadian clocks or oscillators have been identified in most tissues. How the central and peripheral oscillators are synchronized is still being elucidated. Light is the main environmental cue that entrains the circadian clock. Under the absence of a light stimulus, the clock continues its oscillation in a free-running condition. In general, three functional compartments of the circadian clock are defined. The vertebrate retina contains endogenous clocks that control many aspects of retinal physiology, including retinal sensitivity to light, neurohormone synthesis (melatonin and dopamine), rod disk shedding, signalling pathways and gene expression. Neurons with putative local circadian rhythm generation are found among all the major neuron populations in the mammalian retina. In the mouse, clock genes and function are more localized to the inner retinal and ganglion cell layers. The photoreceptor, however, secrete melatonin which may still serve a an important circadian signal. The reception and transmission of the non-visual photic stimulus resides in a small subpopulation (1-3%) or retinal ganglion cells (RGC) that express the pigment melanopsin (Opn4) and are called intrisically photoreceptive RGC (ipRGC). Melanopsin peak absorption is at 420 nm and all the axons of the ipRGC reach the SCN. A common countermeasure for circadian re-entrainment utilizes blue-green light to entrain the circadian clock and mitigate the risk of fatigue and health and performance decrement due to circadian rhythm disruption. However, an effective countermeasure targeting the photoreceptor system requires that the basic circadian molecular machinery remains intact during spaceflight. We hypothesize that spaceflight may affect ipRGC and melanopsin expression, which may be a contributing cause of circadian disruption during spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":20120002675,""id"":""79821bac440e4e1387e91a7ceb5ed3b0"",""publicationDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20120002675,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""d94708c33e604ca9bddfd276f75f613b""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20120002675,""endDate"":""2012-02-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""2d0904f226fa46368c206ea243563489"",""id"":""9b9f0ef301cc4591b9a8dd77cd8fb342""}],""name"":""2012 NASA Human Research Program (HRP) Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""2d0904f226fa46368c206ea243563489"",""startDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120002675
20205002354,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Preliminary Design of an 'Autonomous Medical Response Agent' Interface Prototype for Long Duration Spaceflight,"[""Melodie Yashar"",""Isabel Christina Torron Valverde"",""Jayant Menon"",""Jessica J Marquez""]","Major challenges for astronauts in future long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs) will be that crewmembers are not expected to be medical professionals, may be under high workload and stress, are facing physiological challenges caused by spaceflight, and will have limited, delayed voice communications with medical support from Earth. An autonomous medical response agent (AMRA) is envisioned to help astronauts address medical complaints, develop a differential diagnosis, and guide self-treatment until a healthy state is restored. AMRA develops a process of personalized diagnosis and treatment through a Bayesian predictive control system that recommends therapeutic control actions including diagnostic tests and treatments to crewmembers (Menon, 2020). The Human Computer Interaction (HCI) lab from NASA Ames Research Center’s Human Systems Integration Division (Code TH) has collaborated with Nahlia Inc in human-centered design augmentation research for AMRA. The project, titled Design of ‘Autonomous Medical Response Agent Interface Prototype for Long Duration Spaceflight, has been funded by the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) and introduces an interactive user-interface prototype that guides astronauts through self-diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation while communicating with remote specialists in ground support (most notably a patient’s flight surgeon). Our project develops the interaction design for the crewmember using AMRA through user research, iterative design, and usability testing to evaluate the user interface and workflow designed.

The interface design deliverable for this project, titled AMRA Aggregate Information Display (AMRA AID) is an integrated information display system for comprehensive autonomous medical guidance, diagnosis, and treatment of in-flight medical conditions experienced by crewmembers. AMRA AID demonstrates how we might ensure crew autonomy, increase the crew’s medical capabilities, and decrease cognitive burden within a front-end user interface. AMRA AID refrains from relying on input from ground or mission control for self-treatment of medical issues—though ground awareness and communication with ground is maintained as a means of ensuring trust between mission control and crew. AMRA AID demonstrates how the crew’s on-board medical system might integrate with information from vehicle monitoring and crew schedule, without assuming causal relationships. AMRA AID’s comprehensive view enables efficient information access for both crew and ground support, reducing cognitive burden in the event of an unplanned or emergency medical incident and enabling informed analytical decisions to be made based on both crew and vehicle health. Human-centered design augmentation advanced within the prototype included: enhanced workflow and treatment guidance for two medical scenarios for a non-specialist user base with various levels of medical training, interaction design which considered speech (conversational user interface) elements and on-screen interactions to be developed in future iterations of the project, communication design and functional requirements relevant to self-care versus caring for another astronaut, as well as user testing of the prototype with an international space medical community. This project arrives at critical findings regarding usability needs, communication requirements, and integrated information requirements for a future technology interface functioning to increase confidence between ground support and LDEM crewmembers.

Deep space travel will include added risk related to stressors from the isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environment that lies outside the boundaries of low-earth orbit.  Currently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered the gold standard treatment for many mental health diagnoses including anxiety and depression; however, SSRIs are also associated with several undesired side effects.  The utility of non-pharmacologic therapies for the management of behavioral health conditions has not yet been fully explored.
Methods:  A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed and relevant articles pertaining to the psychological impacts of ICE environments, use of SSRIs in spaceflight, side effects associated with SSRIs, and non-pharmacologic treatments for anxiety and depression were reviewed.  Over 100 studies were reviewed in total.
Results:  Reduced bone mineral density, impaired hemostatic function, significant individual variability resulting from gene polymorphisms, and drug-drug interactions are well described adverse effects of SSRIs that may complicate their operational use in the deep space environment.  Many non-pharmacologic therapies have been utilized with success for the management of behavioral health conditions in the terrestrial environment that may show promise for long duration missions. 
Discussion:  Although SSRIs have long been considered standard of care treatment for many behavioral health conditions, we cannot trivialize the risk that prolonged pharmacologic therapy may pose.  The need to mitigate these risks by exploring alternative non-pharmacologic therapies has never been more relevant.

The Problem Statement describes why it is important to implement a fully integrated research plan to derive risk estimates for the combined, potentially synergistic, effects of the three major spaceflight hazards (space radiation; isolated, confined, and extreme environments; altered gravity). These risk estimates will help establish acceptable maximum decrement or change in a physiological or behavioral parameter during or after spaceflight, and the acceptable limit of exposure to the combined spaceflight hazards. This Implementation Strategy describes how the research plan will accomplish the CBS Integrated Research Plan goals. The Implementation Strategy includes approaches to evaluate relationships among biological responses underlying three risks that are managed by three of NASA’s Human Research Project (HRP) organizational “elements”. This CBS (Acute effects of radiation on CNS, BMed, Sensorimotor) Integrated Research Plan also identifies strategies to monitor and mitigate decrements to operationally relevant performance. Currently, the strategy that was initiated in 2018, includes an eight-year research plan and a four-year validation plan that extend to the year 2030. Once the monitoring tools and countermeasures are developed, they will be validated and refined during four years of early exploration missions. The planned tasks and their associated research products and deliverables have been mapped to the individual research emphases to clearly demonstrate how each research area helps ensure crew health and safety during exploration missions.","[{""submissionId"":20205003665,""id"":""b29bd9f5060e403790a46c9ad38c73c9"",""publicationName"":"""",""publicationDate"":""2019-08-16T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20205003665,""name"":"""",""location"":"""",""id"":""f71381927fe349d8b10f2807708755ff""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Space Transportation And Safety""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205003665
20240001260,POSTER,Development of Machine Learning-Derived Microbiological and Immune Signatures: Applications in Adaptive Risk Assessment of Infectious Disease During Spaceflight,"[""Kristyn Hoffman"",""C. Mark Ott""]","Infectious diseases represent an urgent risk for spaceflight with consequences ranging from loss in crew performance to crew incapacitation or loss of life should an outbreak occur. The resident environmental microbiome on the International Space Station has been monitored through routine surveillance over almost twenty years, beginning with culture-based microbial detection which has advanced to molecular methods in recent years. This has created a wealth of data that we have begun mining to define the microbial ecology of the ISS. Summarized here is our analysis of data from the historical microbial population defined by culture-based monitoring from the past two decades, organized by their likelihood to cause disease into clinical categories. As expected, many residents of the normal microflora in environments where people work and live were detected. However, some known pathogens were also detected. As the spaceflight environment can predispose humans to infection, crew health records were used to source additional data for the set to uncover clinical relevance. 

Data mining was performed on crew health records to capture adverse health events that may be related to infectious disease. Machine learning, specifically Random Forest analysis, was used to analyze the microbial and crew health datasets. The symptom categories were not explained by the ranked bacteria, due to lack of sufficient data for some categories and due to poor ranking of the pathogens for others. Poor ranking of the bacteria could be due to the clinical symptoms being linked to other disease-causing factors, such as allergy or viral infection. These findings suggest a lack of relationship between bacteria detected on surfaces in the ISS and historical health events experienced by astronauts.

Current exercise countermeasures on the International Space Station (ISS) include treadmill running, cycle ergometry, and resistive exercise, which are used to protect crewmember health and performance during long-duration spaceflight. However, exploration vehicles for Artemis and beyond will have volume and power restrictions, requiring exercise hardware to have a smaller footprint and use fewer resources. Thus, recent efforts have focused on developing exercise devices (such as the European Enhanced Exploration Exercise Device [E4D]) that provide both aerobic and resistive training on one platform without including a treadmill. It is critical to validate the efficacy of exploration-focused exercise modalities to preserve muscle strength, aerobic fitness, bone density, and sensorimotor performance. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the physiological effects of spaceflight that occur with nominal ISS exercise prescriptions compared to exploration-forward exercise modalities to determine if a treadmill is required to maintain current levels of protection during long-duration missions.

METHODS:    
Crewmembers will be assigned to one of three groups: 1) Control Group (n ≥ 40), who will partake in nominal exercise on the ISS, including running on the Treadmill with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization 2 (T2), ergometry on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (CEVIS) device, and strength training on the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED); 2) Active Group 1, who will partake in CEVIS and ARED exercise only (n = 8); and 3) Active Group 2, who will partake in aerobic and resistive exercise on the E4D only (n = 8). For Active Group 1, nominal aerobic exercise on T2 will be replaced with corresponding exercise on CEVIS. For Active Group 2, a dedicated exercise prescription will be designed to maximize the capabilities of the E4D to include resistive exercise, cycle ergometry, rowing, and rope pulling. Crewmembers in both active groups will not be permitted to perform treadmill exercise. Health and performance markers including bone mineral density (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]), body composition (DXA), cardiovascular fitness (cycle VO2peak), muscle strength and endurance (isometric/isokinetic testing, power endurance testing), sensorimotor performance (sit-to-stand, obstacle course), postural control (computerized dynamic posturography), and blood and urine biochemical markers of bone metabolism will be assessed before, during, and following spaceflight.

RESULTS:    
Thirteen subjects (3 Active [CEVIS + ARED], 10 Control) have been recruited for this study. Data collection is currently in progress. 

CONCLUSIONS:    
This study will assess the efficacy of exploration exercise modalities, including the effects of removing the treadmill exercise capability or of exclusively using the E4D, compared to nominal ISS exercise across an entire mission on bone, muscle, aerobic, and sensorimotor health and performance. Findings from this study will help provide a recommendation on whether these exploration exercise modalities can sufficiently protect against physiological deconditioning during spaceflight or whether a treadmill may be required to maintain current levels of protection during future exploration class spaceflight missions.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240000929,""endDate"":""2024-02-16T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""0a16fa5847aa4eeab4e2834afd9f8e3d"",""id"":""5cf78571855c40c790bccfc8eb37a705""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program-Investigators Workshop (HRP-IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""0a16fa5847aa4eeab4e2834afd9f8e3d"",""url"":""https://www.edgereg.net/er/EventHomePage/CustomPage.jsp?ActivityID=42008&ItemID=137127 "",""startDate"":""2024-02-13T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.03.01.32.2161"",""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240000929

20130011053,PRESENTATION,Psychophysiology of Spaceflight and Aviation,"[""Cowings, Patricia"",""Toscano, William""]","In space, the absence of gravity alone causes unique physiological stress. Significant biomedical changes, across multiple organ systems, such as body fluid redistribution, diminished musculoskeletal strength, changes in cardiac function and sensorimotor control have been reported. The time course of development of these disorders and severity of symptoms experienced by individuals varies widely. Space motion sickness (SMS) is an example of maladaptation to microgravity, which occurs early in the mission and can have profound effects on physical health and crew performance. Disturbances in sleep quality, perception, emotional equilibrium and mood have also been reported, with impact to health and performance varying widely across individuals. And lastly, post-flight orthostatic intolerance, low blood pressure experienced after returning to Earth, is also of serious concern. Both the Russian and American space programs have a varied list of human errors and mistakes, which adversely impacted mission goals. Continued probability of human exposure to microgravity for extended time periods provides a rationale for the study of the effects of stress. The primary focus of this research group is directed toward examining individual differences in: (a) prediction of susceptibility to these disorders, (b) assessment of symptom severity, (c) evaluation of the effectiveness of countermeasures, and (d) developing and testing a physiological training method, Autogenic-Feedback Training Exercise (AFTE) as a countermeasure with multiple applications.

The SFHSS is composed of 2 volumes. Volume 1, Crew Health, contains medical levels of care, permissible exposure limits, and fitness for duty criteria, and permissible outcome limits as a means of defining successful operating criteria for the human system. Volume 2, Habitability and Environmental Health, contains environmental, habitability and human factors standards. Development of the Human Integration Design Handbook (HIDH), a companion to the standard, is currently under construction and entails the update and revision of NASA-STD-3000 data. This new handbook will, in the fashion of NASA STD-3000, assist engineers and designers in appropriately applying habitability, environmental and human factors principles to spacecraft design. Organized in a chapter-module-element structure, the HIDH will provide the guidance for the development of requirements, design considerations, lessons learned, example solutions, background research, and assist in the identification of gaps and research needs in the disciplines. Subject matter experts have been and continue to be solicited to participate in the update of the chapters. The purpose is to build the HIDH with the best and latest data, and provide a broad representation from experts in industry, academia, the military and the space program. The handbook and the two standards volumes work together in a unique way to achieve the required level of human-system interface. All new NASA programs will be required to meet Volumes 1 and 2. Volume 2 presents human interface goals in broad, non-verifiable standards. Volume 2 also requires that each new development program prepare a set of program-specific human factors requirements. These program-specific human and environmental factors requirements must be verifiable and tailored to assure the new system meets the Volume 2 standards. Programs will use the HIDH to write their verifiable program-specific requirements.","[{""submissionId"":20070017247,""id"":""e1e16ccac2b94a1dbfec5dde98ca3ec9"",""publicationDate"":""2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20070017247,""endDate"":""2007-05-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Department of Defense Human Factors Engineering meeting"",""location"":""Portsmouth, VA"",""id"":""375aecc656a94700bfc2a12e9bc505ed"",""startDate"":""2007-05-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070017247

While space travellers are very interested in having countermeasures to the deleterious effects of space missions, they have a powerful disincentive to participate in this research if they feel it could in any way negatively affect their flight status. The behavioral issues of isolation and confinement for extended-duration space missions are reviewed. Areas of basic and clinical behavioral research are listed. And the classical clinical model for research is not considered appropriate for the current configuration of the space program. The use of analogue environments and advanced statistical analysis are suggested as ways to address the limited spaceflight research opportunities.

20090037576,ABSTRACT,An Effective Health and Medical Technical Authority,"[""Fogarty, Jennifer A.""]","The NASA Governance model directed the formation of three Technical Authorities, Engineering; Safety and Mission Assurance; and Health and Medical, to ensure that risks are identified and adjudicated efficiently and transparently in concert with the spaceflight programs and projects. The Health and Medical Technical Authority (HMTA) has been implemented at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) and consists of the Chief Medical Office (CMO), the Deputy CMO, and HMTA Delegates. The JSC HMTA achieves the goals of risk identification and adjudication through the discharge of the appropriate technical expertise to human space flight programs and projects and the escalation of issues within program and technical authority boards. The JSC HMTA relies on subject matter experts (SMEs) in the Space Life Sciences Directorate at JSC as well as experts from other Centers to work crew health and performance issues at the technical level, develop requirements, oversee implementation and validation of requirements, and identify risks and non-compliances. Once a risk or potential noncompliance has been identified and reported to the programs or projects, the JSC HMTA begins to track it and closely monitor the program's or project's response. As a risk is developed or a non-compliance negotiated, positions from various levels of decision makers are sought at the program and project control boards. The HMTA may support a program or project position if it is satisfied with the decision making and vetting processes (ex. the subject matter expert voiced his/her concerns and all dissenting opinions were documented) and finds that the position both acknowledges the risk and cost of the mitigation and resolves the issue without changing NASA risk posture. The HMTA may disagree with a program or project position if the NASA risk posture has been elevated or obfuscated. If the HMTA does disagree with the program or project position, it will appeal to successively higher levels of authority so that risk acceptance and risk trades will be acknowledged and sanctioned at the highest appropriate level; this includes Program Managers, Mission Directorate Associate Administrators and the Agency Administrator.","[{""submissionId"":20090037576,""id"":""153fb76ff26542a6aecd7199931f34e9"",""publicationDate"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20090037576,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""6655d311874b46c597743ff141e6026e""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20090037576,""endDate"":""2010-05-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""67ec9cee92474ca08b339474401ce0f5"",""id"":""1863fcc47422459d9c6a1f73db9a73dc""}],""name"":""81st AsMA Annual Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""Phoenix, AZ"",""id"":""67ec9cee92474ca08b339474401ce0f5"",""startDate"":""2010-05-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090037576
20110023077,ABSTRACT,Contribution of Spaceflight Environmental Factors to Vision Risks,"[""Zanello, Susana B.""]","The risk of visual impairment and elevated intracranial pressure as a result of low-earth orbit microgravity exposure has directed our attention and research efforts to the eye. While the alterations observed in astronauts returning from long duration missions include vision and neuroanatomical changes observed by non-invasive methods, other effects and subsequent tissue responses at the molecular and cellular level can only be studied by accessing the tissue itself. As a result of this need, several studies are currently taking place within the Human and Health Countermeasures Element (HHC) that use animal models for eye research. The rodent eye has many similarities to the human eye, and both rats and mice have historically been used as models of human eye disease, aiding in the identification of the disease genes, elucidation of mechanisms of disease, as well as in the assessment of therapeutic treatments. These studies attempt to answer two central questions in the etiology of possible vision alterations in the environment of space exploration missions. The first is: what effects and response mechanisms take place in the different eye structures at the cellular and molecular level? The second question is directed to elucidate the contribution of the various environmental stressors (radiation, nutrition, fluid shift) to these effects. Collaborative approaches with internal and external investigators have allowed performing these studies in a most cost-effective fashion, providing preliminary data and laying the bases for testing further hypotheses in future and specifically designed animal experiments. From a study centered on the radioadaptive response in mice, we have learned that the retina responds to low and high dose gamma radiation by elevating antioxidant-related genes at early time points (4hrs) and that this response returns to control levels after 1 day post-irradiation. We are expanding this research with another collaborative study that investigates the combined effects of radiation exposure and iron overload on sensitivity to radiation injury in rat eyes. All main eye structures will be analyzed in this study: retina, lens and cornea. A study in collaboration with the Space Human Factors and Habitability Element (SHFH) investigates the effects of lunar dust exposure on the rat cornea. It is anticipated that common underlying oxidative stress mechanisms of damage may be observed as a result of these three stressors: radiation, nutritional iron and lunar dust. The contribution of fluid shift is addressed by a study using rats subjected to hindlimb suspension. The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that the mechanical stress imparted by the pressure differential across the optic disc and lamina cribosa will impact oxygenation (therefore causing oxidative stress and hypoxia) and cell survival. This study also includes the assessment of two nutritional antioxidant countermeasures: epigallocatechin gallate (green tea) and resveratrol. Finally, as a result of two successful tissue sharing efforts, we are proceeding with the analysis of eye samples of mice aboard two shuttle missions: STS-133 and STS-135. Results from the STS-133 study are presented in an independent abstract. Briefly, the results show that spaceflight represents a source of environmental stress that directly translates into oxidative and cellular stress in the retina. Similar analysis is also planned for the cornea. These samples add large value to our current vision research as they provide data on the direct effects of low-earth orbit spaceflight on eye structures and physiology.","[{""submissionId"":20110023077,""id"":""07e3982208484c009858fae55d49838c"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20110023077,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""3b0d8bd0cba840c3b1decfaa24936dee""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110023077,""endDate"":""2012-02-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""2312b555e6644f2ea83206dfa4357fc8"",""id"":""9436c7f7aa304d9696f241e8ca58a3d4""}],""name"":""2012 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""2312b555e6644f2ea83206dfa4357fc8"",""startDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110023077
20205009726,PRESENTATION,Neurovascular Outcomes of Ionizing Radiation in Human Blood-Brain Barrier Models,"[""Egle Cekanaviciute""]","One of the main health risks in human deep space exploration is central nervous system (CNS) damage by ionizing radiation due to exposure to galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). In animal models, irradiation with simulated GCRs or their components has been shown to cause neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation associated with cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. The extent of CNS damage is partially mediated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which regulates the interaction between CNS and systemic responses to stressors in the rest of the body. The main cellular regulators of BBB permeability are astrocytes, which also modulate neuronal death, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. However, studies on BBB and astrocyte functions in regulating CNS responses to ionizing radiation have been limited, especially in human tissue/organ analogs. Therefore, we developed a high throughput 3D human neurovascular system model, based on commercially available Mimetas OrganoPlates seeded by primary human cells, to investigate the neurovascular responses to simulated deep space radiation. Using this system, we have demonstrated that 600MeV/n 56Fe irradiation leads to cellular damage and increased blood-brain barrier permeability via dysfunction of brain cells called astrocytes, which appear to be the weakest link and therefore a highly suitable countermeasure target to reduce the impact of space radiation on the blood-brain barrier. We anticipate that our results form merely the first step in ongoing development of organ models, including their adaptation for personalized risk assessment, high throughput approaches to countermeasure screening and validation, and eventual payload adaptation.

20100036735,ABSTRACT,Critical Questions for Space Human Factors,"[""Woolford, Barbara"",""Bagian, Tandi""]","Traditional human factors contributions to NASA's crewed space programs have been rooted in the classic approaches to quantifying human physical and cognitive capabilities and limitations in the environment of interest, and producing recommendations and standards for the selection or design of mission equipment. Crews then evaluate the interfaces, displays, or equipment, and with the assistance of human factors experts, improvements are made as funds, time, control documentation, and weight allow. We have come a long way from the early spaceflight days, where men with the ' right stuff were the solution to operating whatever equipment was given to them. The large and diverse Shuttle astronaut corps has impacted mission designs to accommodate a wide range of human capabilities and preferences. Yet with existing long duration experience, we have seen the need to address a different set of dynamics when designing for optimal crew performance: critical equipment and mission situations degrade, and human function changes with mission environment, situation, and duration. Strategies for quantifying the critical nature of human factors requirements are being worked by NASA. Any exploration-class mission will place new responsibilities on mission designers to provide the crew with the information and resources to accomplish the mission. The current duties of a Mission Control Center to monitor system status, detect degradation or malfunction, and provide a proven solution, will need to be incorporated into on-board systems to allow the crew autonomous decision-making. The current option to resupply and replace mission systems and resources, including both vehicle equipment and human operators, will be removed, so considerations of maintenance, onboard training, and proficiency assessment are critical to providing a self-sufficient crew. As we 'move in' to the International Space Station, there are tremendous opportunities to investigate our ability to design for autonomous crews. Yet prioritizing the research that can and should be done by NASA will be based on the critical nature of the issues, and the impact of the individual research questions on mission design. The risks to crew health and safety associated with answering critical human factors issues must be properly included and communicated in order to support the Agency's decisions regarding future space programs.","[{""submissionId"":20100036735,""id"":""92350c88dc0440838c2fabf731ee0504"",""publicationDate"":""2000-11-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20100036735,""name"":""American Nuclear Society"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""735fcc7091bc4be98f7c39b27f84d34b""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20100036735,""endDate"":""2000-11-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Nuclear Society"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""6cb8069a3f954defaa19123619de3693"",""id"":""1a68af08391d4bb6983e33f5e46ba8aa""}],""name"":""Nuclear Plan Instrumentation Control and Human-Machine"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""6cb8069a3f954defaa19123619de3693"",""startDate"":""2000-11-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100036735
20160013661,ABSTRACT,The Stability of Bioactive Compounds in Spaceflight Foods,"[""Cooper, M. R."",""Douglas, G. L.""]","The status and stability of bioactive compounds in the processed and shelf-stable spaceflight food system have not previously been investigated though the presence of such compounds in aged space foods could have health significance for crews on long duration exploration missions. Over forty foods - either existing International Space Station (ISS) food provisioning items, newly developed foods for spaceflight, or commercially-available ready-to-eat foods - that were predicted to have a relatively high concentrations of one or more bioactive compounds (lycopene, lutein, omega-3 fatty acids, phenolics, sterols, and/or flavonoids) were selected for the study. Food samples were sent overnight to the Food Composition Laboratory of the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University (Corvallis, OR) for bioactive compound analysis. Three packages of each product were blended together for the analysis to reduce package-to-package variability. All ISS food items and commercial foods were analyzed initially and after 12 and 24 months of 21degC storage. Food development occurred in a staggered fashion, so data collection for the newly developed foods continues. Lastly, sensory evaluation and additional temperature storage data (4degC, 35degC) for select foods were collected to establish additional stability parameters. Efficacious concentrations of lycopene, lutein, and omega-3 fatty acids were measured in limited spaceflight foods; two grams of sterols a day may be difficult to achieve with the current space diet. Total polyphenol delivery appears stable and adequate, but individual phenolic compounds vary in stability and were not specifically evaluated in this study. The data suggests that some bioactive compounds, like lycopene and lutein, degrade and then plateau at some equilibrium concentration. The anthocyanin stability appears to be related to storage temperature and food matrix, and lutein stability in leafy vegetables may be impacted by storage temperature. Because of the limited number of foods with high concentrations of the bioactive compounds, additional menu variety, formulation optimization, and reduced temperature storage will be required to ensure delivery of several bioactive compounds in the space food system. Validation of stability to five years will enable provisioning of these functional foods within the space food system for a mission to Mars.","[{""submissionId"":20160013661,""id"":""0e20db81412d4d618722a806cf10745f"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160013661,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ea708ebbe8a84c7fa994ffea194e0b78"",""id"":""8f7aa37b035d4e299679c930b99e62aa""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigator''s Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""ea708ebbe8a84c7fa994ffea194e0b78"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160013661

Recent large animal-model research in space-analogs closely mimicking SPEs has identified coagulopathic events independent of the hematopoietic sequelae of higher radiation doses, similar in manifestation to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Ongoing operations supporting NASA's spaceflight goals benefit from the research portfolios that address risks to mission success. Similarly, these research portfolios are informed by operations to ensure investigations stay relevant given the dynamic environment of spaceflight. There are many success stories that can be presented where initial work begun as a BHP Research project, and funded through the Human Research Program, was fully implemented in operations or addressed an operational need. Examples include improving effectiveness of the debriefings used within Mission Control by the Mission Operations Directorate and countermeasures for fatigue management. There is also ongoing collaboration with research and operations for developing selection methods for future generation astronauts, and to enhance and inform the current family support function. The objective of this panel is to provide examples of recent success stories, describe areas where close collaboration is benefitting ongoing research and operations, and summarize how this will come together as NASA plans for the one year ISS mission - a unique opportunity for both BHP operations and research to learn more about preparing and supporting crewmembers for extended missions in space.

20140013304,ABSTRACT,Identification and Evaluation of Integration and Cross Cutting Issues Across HRP Risks,"[""Steinberg, S. L. "",""Shelhamer, Mark""]","The HRP Integrated Research Plan contains the research plans for the 32 risks requiring research to characterize and mitigate. These risks to human health and performance in spaceflight are identified by evidence and each one focuses on a single aspect of human physiology or performance. They are further categorized by aspects of the spaceflight environment, such as altered gravity or space radiation, that that play a major role in their likelihood and consequence. From its inception the ""integrate"" in the Research Plan has denoted the integrated nature of risks to human health and performance, the connectedness of physiological systems within the human body regardless of the spaceflight environment, and the integrated response of the human body to the spaceflight environment. Common characteristics of the spaceflight environment include altered gravity, atmospheres and light/dark cycles, space radiation, isolation, noise, and periods of high or low workload. Long term exposure to this unique environment produces a suite of physiological effects such as stress; vision, neurocognitive and anthropometric changes; circadian misalignment; fluid shifts, deconditioning; immune dysregulation; and altered nutritional requirements. Matrix diagraming was used to systematically identify, analyze and rate the many-to-many relationships between environmental characteristics and the suite of physiological effects. It was also to identify patterns in the relationships of common physiological effects to each other. Analyses of patterns or relationships in these diagrams help to identify issues that cut across multiple risks. Cross cutting issues benefit from a multidisciplinary approach that synthesizes concepts or data from two or more disciplines to identify and characterize risk factors or develop countermeasures relevant to multiple risks. They also help to illuminate possible problem areas that may arise when a countermeasure impacts risks other than those which it was developed to mitigate, or identify groupings of physiological changes that are likely to occur that may impact the overall risk posture.","[{""submissionId"":20140013304,""id"":""8cd33d50ca8a4c33bd359f49d98fd5f4"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140013304,""endDate"":""2015-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""2015 Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""b03c17019ac84864b8931a41d3ef04fb"",""startDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140013304

20100031889,PREPRINT,Acoustic Issues in Human Spaceflight,"[""Clark, Jonathan B.""]","NASA is concerned about acute effect of sound on crew performance on International Space Station (ISS), and is developing strategies to assess and reduce acute, chronic, and delayed effects of sound. High noise levels can cause headaches, irritation, fatigue, impaired sleep, headache, and tinnitus and have resulted in an inability to hear alarms. Speech intelligibility may be more impaired for crew understanding non-native language in a noisy environment. No hearing loss occurred, but significant effects on crew performance and communication occurred. Permanent Threshold Shifts (PTS) have not been observed in the US shuttle program. Russian specification for noise in spacecraft is 60 dBA (awake) and 50 dBA (asleep) while the U.S. noise specification on ISS is NC 50 (awake) and NC 40 (asleep) with a 85 dBA hazard limit. Background noise levels of ISS modules have measured 56-69 dBA. Treadmill exercise operations measure 77 dBA. Alarms are required to be 20 dBA above ambient. Hearing protection is recommended when noise exceeds 60 dB 24 hour Leq. Countermeasures include hearing protection and design/ engineering controls. Advanced composite materials with excellent low frequency attenuation properties could be applied as a barrier protection around noisy equipment, or used on personal protective equipment worn by the crew. Hearing protection countermeasures include foam ear inserts, passive muff headsets, and active noise reduction headsets. Oto-acoustic emissions (OAE) could be used to monitor effectiveness of hearing protection countermeasures and tailor hearing protection countermeasures to individual crewmembers. Micro-gravity, vibration, toxic fumes, air quality/composition, stress, temperature, physical exertion or some combination of the above factors may have interacted with moderate long-term noise exposure to cause significant hearing loss. Longitudinal studies will need to address what co-morbidity factors, such as radiation, toxicology, microgravity effects (fluid shift), aging, are involved with hearing loss.","[{""submissionId"":20100031889,""id"":""7e759846284c41a28d5c526a88845ed8"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100031889

Head down-tilt bed rest (HDBR) serves as a microgravity analog because it mimics the headward fluid shift and limb unloading of spaceflight. We investigated focal brain white matter (WM) changes and fluid shifts during 70 days of 6 deg HDBR in 16 subjects who were assessed pre (2x), during (3x), and post-HDBR (2x). Changes over time were compared to those in control subjects (n=12) assessed four times over 90 days. Diffusion MRI was used to assess WM microstructure and fluid shifts. Free-Water Imaging, derived from diffusion MRI, was used to quantify the distribution of intracranial extracellular free water (FW). Additionally, we tested whether WM and FW changes correlated with changes in functional mobility and balance measures. HDBR resulted in FW increases in fronto-temporal regions and decreases in posterior-parietal regions that largely recovered by two weeks post-HDBR. WM microstructure was unaffected by HDBR. FW decreased in the post-central gyrus and precuneus. We previously reported that gray matter increases in these regions were associated with less HDBR-induced balance impairment, suggesting adaptive structural neuroplasticity. Future studies are warranted to determine causality and underlying mechanisms.","[{""submissionId"":20170000801,""id"":""b967f1ee9b0b439e928f5555d1b09867"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170000801,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""5e263e09d52345b492a05638c1dcf696"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""4f2d0360c15c4a029c3255ae6fff326d"",""id"":""388caf9ec08e4bafb93ee5b7cbb0ef60""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst.

Predicting and mitigating personalized health risks from space radiation exposure requires understanding the factors underlying individual radiation sensitivity, which currently remain unknown. We started to address this challenge by identifying the genomic and demographic associations with sensitivity to low and high-LET ionizing radiation in the largest human sample cohort to date and by evaluating baseline DNA damage as a potential predictor of radiation responses. We have collected and irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 768 healthy donors of matched ethnicity, 50/50 male/female, 18-70 years old. We have analyzed the responses of 576 donor PBMCs to irradiation with simulated galactic cosmic ray components: 350MeV/n 28Si, 350MeV/n 40Ar and 600MeV/n 56Fe, at 1.1 and 3 particles/100μm2 fluences, as well as 0.1Gy and 1Gy doses of gamma rays, at 4 and 24 hours post irradiation. We quantified post-irradiation DNA repair based on radiation-induced 53BP1+ foci formation, together with oxidative stress and cell death using a flow cytometry-based assay. We also assessed baseline levels of DNA repair in PBMCs at the time of sample collection prior to irradiation experiments. We observed a wide variability of subject- and LET-dependent radiation responses, with radiation-induced DNA repair foci increasing with LET, though oxidative stress being notably reduced by high-LET irradiation, potentially due to a switch between hydrogen peroxide and oxygen radical-based mechanisms. We also identified a relationship between few DNA repair foci at baseline and increased DNA repair after irradiation, accompanied by an alteration in immunoregulatory cytokine secretion, which might be adapted as biomarkers to predict ionizing radiation sensitivity. Among demographic variables, baseline foci levels were positively associated with age and latent cytomegalovirus infection. Finally, we have performed low-throughput whole genome sequencing of all samples and are currently in process of identifying the genes and pathways associated with low and high-LET ionizing radiation sensitivity in humans.

The NASA Human Research Program (HRP) within the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) is managing next generation Advanced Exercise Concepts (AEC) requirements development and candidate technology maturation to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 (ground prototyping and flight demonstration) for all exploration mission profiles from Multi Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Exploration Missions (up to 21 day duration) to Mars Transit (up to 1000 day duration) missions. These validated and optimized exercise countermeasures systems will be provided to the ISS Program and MPCV Program for subsequent flight development and operations. The International Space Station (ISS) currently has three major pieces of operational exercise countermeasures hardware: the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), the second-generation (T2) treadmill, and the cycle ergometer with vibration isolation system (CEVIS). This suite of exercise countermeasures hardware serves as a benchmark and is a vast improvement over previous generations of countermeasures hardware, providing both aerobic and resistive exercise for the crew. However, vehicle and resource constraints for future exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit will require that the exercise countermeasures hardware mass, volume, and power be minimized, while preserving the current ISS capabilities or even enhancing these exercise capabilities directed at mission specific physiological functional performance and medical standards requirements. Further, mission-specific considerations such as preservation of sensorimotor function, autonomous and adaptable operation, integration with medical data systems, rehabilitation, and in-flight monitoring and feedback are being developed for integration with the exercise countermeasures systems. Numerous technologies have been considered and evaluated against HRP-approved functional device requirements for these extreme mission profiles, and include wearable sensors, exoskeletons, flywheel, pneumatic, and closed-loop microprocessor controlled motor driven systems. Each technology has unique advantages and disadvantages. The Advanced Exercise Concepts project oversees development of candidate next generation exercise countermeasures hardware, performs trade studies of current and state of the art exercise technologies, manages and supports candidate systems physiological evaluations with human test subjects on the ground, in flight analogs and flight. The near term goal is evaluation of candidate systems in flight, culminating in an integrated candidate next generation exercise countermeasures suite on the ISS which coalesces research findings from HRP disciplines in the areas of exercise performance for muscle, bone, cardiovascular, sensorimotor, behavioral health, and nutrition for optimal benefit to the crew.","[{""submissionId"":20160012339,""id"":""d7bf44ac2caf471ebe63b1bbbef7ba1e"",""publicationDate"":""2015-02-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160012339,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b35732f6fdf341ea9d90f442294ff699"",""id"":""6fee0121ea5a4cf1956b3c28d06271ce""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""b35732f6fdf341ea9d90f442294ff699"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 516724.01.02.10"",""NNJ11HE31A""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160012339

20205004970,CONTRACTOR_OR_GRANTEE_REPORT,Development and Comparison of an Artificial Gravity Concept for Human Spaceflight,"[""Alice Elberfeld""]","This Internship served as a resource to find specific research about the many facets of artificial gravity. With three main areas to be addressed in detail: the negative health effects of microgravity and how current mitigation methods fall short, the knowns and unknowns of artificial gravity as a countermeasure, and past artificial gravity habitat concepts. This report primarily focuses on the negative health effects of microgravity and how current mitigation methods fall short. Through NASA resources such as the NTRS, and external sources such as the AIAA, research papers were gathered that were pertinent to the topic. Each paper was uploaded to a NASA SharePoint and abstracts were drafted to highlight the important information. The expected results were to build a library of easily accessible information that would allow for Ryan Joyce and Gabe Merrill to easily get up to speed on relevant information. This process should allow for a faster period of understanding with high relevancy material. The ability to quickly reference data will help to build an informed and detailed case for any future proposals on artificial gravity. This also prevents the need to spend many hours searching for relevant documentation, allowing for more time to be dedicated to the creation process. The project has successfully met expectations and is continuing to add pertinent documentation. Current research shows great potential for artificial gravity as a countermeasure on long duration missions. The gravity like forces created in an artificial gravity ship could help to prevent serious problems such as muscle loss, bone fractures, vision loss due to increased intracranial pressure, and would allow for transition to other gravity environments with little to no recovery period. These conditions are highly favorable for long duration missions as current mitigation methods have yet to be proven beyond one year in space and often only slow symptoms instead of preventing them.","[{""submissionId"":20205004970,""id"":""30a785e965fa4a589280be5356c28586"",""publicationDate"":""2020-08-07T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20205004970,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""68603dff261e5d2d9de5a550aa9e6b30"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Langley Research Center"",""location"":""Hampton, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""5c01af80ecd74948b7b7af630e0417e2"",""id"":""54992319ae7e44e88c8cc1982f23b350""}],""name"":""Summer Interns 2020 Exit Deliverable Presentations"",""location"":""Online"",""id"":""5c01af80ecd74948b7b7af630e0417e2"",""startDate"":""2020-07-31T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNX15AI20H""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205004970

20140012041,ABSTRACT,Automated Miniaturized Instrument for Space Biology Applications and the Monitoring of the Astronauts Health Onboard the ISS,"[""Karouia, Fathi"",""Peyvan, Kia"",""Danley, David"",""Ricco, Antonio J."",""Santos, Orlando"",""Pohorille, Andrew""]","Human space travelers experience a unique environment that affects homeostasis and physiologic adaptation. The spacecraft environment subjects the traveler to noise, chemical and microbiological contaminants, increased radiation, and variable gravity forces. As humans prepare for long-duration missions to the International Space Station (ISS) and beyond, effective measures must be developed, verified and implemented to ensure mission success. Limited biomedical quantitative capabilities are currently available onboard the ISS. Therefore, the development of versatile instruments to perform space biological analysis and to monitor astronauts' health is needed. We are developing a fully automated, miniaturized system for measuring gene expression on small spacecraft in order to better understand the influence of the space environment on biological systems. This low-cost, low-power, multi-purpose instrument represents a major scientific and technological advancement by providing data on cellular metabolism and regulation. The current system will support growth of microorganisms, extract and purify the RNA, hybridize it to the array, read the expression levels of a large number of genes by microarray analysis, and transmit the measurements to Earth. The system will help discover how bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics and how pathogenic bacteria sometimes increase their virulence in space, facilitating the development of adequate countermeasures to decrease risks associated with human spaceflight. The current stand-alone technology could be used as an integrated platform onboard the ISS to perform similar genetic analyses on any biological systems from the tree of life. Additionally, with some modification the system could be implemented to perform real-time in-situ microbial monitoring of the ISS environment (air, surface and water samples) and the astronaut's microbiome using 16SrRNA microarray technology. Furthermore, the current system can be enhanced substantially by combining it with other technologies for automated, miniaturized, high-throughput biological measurements, such as fast sequencing, protein identification (proteomics) and metabolite profiling (metabolomics). Thus, the system can be integrated with other biomedical instruments in order to support and enhance telemedicine capability onboard ISS. NASA's mission includes sustained investment in critical research leading to effective countermeasures to minimize the risks associated with human spaceflight, and the use of appropriate technology to sustain space exploration at reasonable cost. Our integrated microarray technology is expected to fulfill these two critical requirements and to enable the scientific community to better understand and monitor the effects of the space environment on microorganisms and on the astronaut, in the process leveraging current capabilities and overcoming present limitations.

E."",""Morrow, R. C."",""Mitchell, C. A."",""Whitmire, A. M."",""Ploutz-Snyder, R. J."",""Douglas, G. L.""]","The capability to grow nutritious, palatable food for crew consumption during spaceflight has the potential to provide health-promoting, bioavailable nutrients, enhance the dietary experience, and reduce launch mass as we move toward longer-duration missions. However, studies of edible produce during spaceflight have been limited, leaving a significant knowledge gap in the methods required to grow safe, acceptable, nutritious crops for consumption in space. Researchers from Kennedy Space Center, Johnson Space Center, Purdue University and ORBITEC have teamed up to explore the potential for plant growth and food production on the International Space Station (ISS) and future exploration missions. KSC, Purdue, and ORBITEC bring a history of plant and plant-microbial interaction research for ISS and for future bioregenerative life support systems. JSC brings expertise in Advanced Food Technology (AFT), Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP), and statistics. The Veggie vegetable-production system on the ISS offers an opportunity to develop a pick-and-eat fresh vegetable component to the ISS food system as a first step to bioregenerative supplemental food production. We propose growing salad plants in the Veggie unit during spaceflight, focusing on the impact of light quality and fertilizer formulation on crop morphology, edible biomass yield, microbial food safety, organoleptic acceptability, nutritional value, and behavioral health benefits of the fresh produce. The first phase of the project will involve flight tests using leafy greens, with a small Chinese cabbage variety, Tokyo bekana, previously down selected through a series of research tests as a suitable candidate. The second phase will focus on dwarf tomato. Down selection of candidate varieties have been performed, and the dwarf cultivar Red Robin has been selected as the test crop. Four light treatments and three fertilizer treatments will be tested for each crop on the ground, to down select to two light treatments and one fertilizer treatment to test on ISS. Our work will help define light colors, levels, and horticultural best practices to achieve high yields of safe, nutritious leafy greens and tomatoes to supplement a space diet of prepackaged food. Our final deliverable will be the development of growth protocols for these crops in a spaceflight vegetable production system. With this work, and potentially with other pending joint projects, we will continue the synergistic research to help close gaps in the human research roadmap, and enable humans to venture to Mars and beyond.

Specific Aims for this project are: (1) Determine dose-response curves for acute ‘Five-Ion GCR Simulation’ exposure for immune, brain and performance responses in crew age-matched adult male and female mice; (2) Determine effects of acute ‘Five-Ion GCR Simulation’ exposure singly and in combination with simulated microgravity and social isolation, on immune, brain and performance responses in crew age-matched male and female mice mimicking deep space missions; and (3) Determine efficacy of the dietary antioxidant, Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN), a key intermediate in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis. The project relies on established and highly translatable ground-based mouse models and assays with IR exposures to be performed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). The experimental approach will provide definitive data on the timing and mechanisms involved in the oxidative stress response, immune and brain changes, and ensuing functional (behavioral/cognitive) impairments expected during human transit to Mars. This project will identify potential biomarkers for, and mechanisms underlying, structural and functional changes in the immune and nervous systems leading to behavioral/cognitive performance deficits, and its potential application to develop effective countermeasures to mitigate negative health effects of long duration space habitation. The project will address NASA’s efforts to rapidly advance the characterization of risks and identify appropriate countermeasures in anticipation of future deep space missions. Ensuring crew health and performance during extended transits necessitates that sensorimotor and cognitive abilities remain strong to avoid potentially catastrophic health and safety outcomes. Further, despite historically low numbers of female astronauts, the two most recent NASA Astronaut Corps class selections, comprised of ~50% women as compared to men, signal the need to understand how sex differences affect physiological adaptation and health in the space environment. Here, we will determine how key features of the deep space environment may interact to increase risk to crewmembers by negatively impacting health and performance, and identify and develop strategies to characterize and mitigate the potential risks via countermeasures.

20170002612,CONFERENCE_PAPER,EcAMSat and BioSentinel: Autonomous Bio Nanosatellites Addressing Strategic Knowledge Gaps for Manned Spaceflight Beyond LEO,"[""Padgen, Michael R.""]","Manned missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) require that several strategic knowledge gaps about the effects of space travel on the human body be addressed. NASA Ames Research Center has been the leader in developing autonomous bio nanosatellites, including past successful missions for GeneSat, PharmaSat, and O/OREOS, that tackled some of these issues. These nanosatellites provide in situ measurements, which deliver insight into the dynamic changes in cell behavior in microgravity. In this talk, two upcoming bio nanosatellites developed at Ames, the E. coli Antimicrobial Satellite (EcAMSat) and BioSentinel, will be discussed. Both satellites contain microfluidic systems that precisely deliver nutrients to the microorganisms stored within wells of fluidic cards. Each well, in turn, has its own 3-color LED and detector system which is used to monitor changes in metabolic activity with alamarBlue, a redox indicator, and the optical density of the cells. EcAMSat investigates the effects of microgravity on bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs, vital knowledge for understanding how to maintain the health of astronauts in long-term and beyond LEO spaceflight. The behavior of wild type and mutant uropathic E. coli will be compared in microgravity and with ground data to help understand the molecular mechanisms behind antibiotic resistance and how these phenotypes might change in space. BioSentinel seeks to directly measure the effects of space radiation on budding yeast S. cerevisiae, particularly double strand breaks (DSB). While hitching a ride on the SLS EM-1 mission (Orion's first unmanned mission to the moon) in 2018, BioSentinel will be kicked off and enter into a heliocentric orbit, becoming the first study of the effects of radiation on living organisms outside LEO since the Apollo program. The yeast are stored in eighteen independent 16-well microfluidic cards, which will be individually activated over the 12 month mission duration. In addition to the wild type and radiation-sensitive mutant strains, a BioSentinel strain of yeast has been developed, which requires a DSB to reactivate growth, thereby allowing for a direct measurement of DSBs caused by radiation. These two missions demonstrate the utility of using autonomous nanosatellites to address strategic knowledge gaps in the push to once again extend manned spaceflight beyond LEO.","[{""submissionId"":20170002612,""id"":""dcc2a1e460664c36bcc334a5415479db"",""publicationDate"":""2017-03-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170002612,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""ca192ab980754ca9bb67b4c0a2836fb0"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""State Univ. of New York"",""location"":""Albany, NY, United States""}},""meetingId"":""dcd302c76cda429c8e40195d9c0db952"",""id"":""543d8ac3de7a4108adce5ddc7ab2d783""}],""name"":""SUNY Polytechnic Inst.

J."",""Stahl, S"",""Switzer, C.""]","Human missions to Mars will fundamentally transform how the planet is explored, enabling new scientific discoveries through more sophisticated sample acquisition and processing than can currently be implemented in robotic exploration. The presence of humans also poses new challenges, including ensuring astronaut safety and health and monitoring contamination. Because the capability to transfer materials to Earth will be extremely limited, there is a strong need for in situ diagnostic capabilities. Nucleotide sequencing is a particularly powerful tool because it can be used to: (1) mitigate microbial risks to crew by allowing identification of microbes in water, in air, and on surfaces; (2) identify optimal treatment strategies for infections that arise in crew members; and (3) track how crew members, microbes, and mission-relevant organisms (e.g., farmed plants) respond to conditions on Mars through transcriptomic and genomic changes. Sequencing would also offer benefits for science investigations occurring on the surface of Mars by permitting identification of Earth-derived contamination in samples. If Mars contains indigenous life, and that life is based on nucleic acids or other closely related molecules, sequencing would serve as a critical tool for the characterization of those molecules. Therefore, spaceflight-compatible nucleic acid sequencing would be an important capability for both crew health and astrobiology exploration. Advances in sequencing technology on Earth have been driven largely by needs for higher throughput and read accuracy. Although some reduction in size has been achieved, nearly all commercially available sequencers are not compatible with spaceflight due to size, power, and operational requirements. Exceptions are nanopore-based sequencers that measure changes in current caused by DNA passing through pores; these devices are inherently much smaller and require significantly less power than sequencers using other detection methods. Consequently, nanopore-based sequencers could be made flight-ready with only minimal modifications.","[{""submissionId"":20160002394,""id"":""35d09cba0437470d910ec927f7810980"",""publicationDate"":""2016-03-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160002394,""endDate"":""2016-03-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""c48d8d5db08e4b80b5f256cdcd1360dd"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Lunar and Planetary Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""0f1e3c69c28145bd92b4f765195dadcd"",""id"":""3e6e32bd32e84e57af4a9e47146e8451""}],""name"":""Lunar and Planetary Science Conference"",""location"":""The Woodlands, TX"",""id"":""0f1e3c69c28145bd92b4f765195dadcd"",""startDate"":""2016-03-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160002394

Such a system will be achieved through the integration of small, easy to use biomedical sensors that will have the ability to measure, store and transmit physiological parameters during operational and ambulatory activity. Since 2012, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has been active in funding the development of wearable biomonitoring sensors. The Astroskin is the first prototype and consists of a shirt-based garment and headband with embedded sensors, and associated software and technology that measure vital signs, sleep quality and activity level of the wearer. NASA and CSA have been collaborating since 2014 to test and validate this system in a lab environment at Ames Research Center and more recently in the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) located at Johnson Spaceflight Center. Specific objectives of the HERA study were: 1) to assess the performance of the Astroskin biosensor system for long-term health monitoring (24-hours) capabilities and during exercise as a measure of crew fitness; 2) to obtain crew feedback on comfort and usability of the Astroskin system; 3) to demonstrate performance of Bluetooth communication during real-time transmission and for verification of data in this environment; and 4) to obtain baseline data for further development of algorithms and tools that facilitate decision support for diagnosing and monitoring of a sick or injured crewmember. HERA Campaign 3 included four missions (each 30-days in duration) with four crewmembers assigned to each mission. A total of 9 men and 7 women participated in the Astroskin evaluation that included continuous physiological monitoring (24-hours) on mission days MD-11, MD1 (high workload), MD15 (low workload), MD19, MD29, and MD+7. Mission days 19 and 29 also included 30 minutes of sub-maximal exercise on a cycle ergometer. Following each 24-hour monitoring session crew physiological data were downloaded to laptops and each crewmember completed a 28 question survey on their experiences with the Astroskin hardware and software. This presentation will focus on lessons learned from the HERA missions. Specifically it will address Astroskin system performance in terms of data loss and data quality (no comparison to lab standard devices), wireless communication with the onboard mobile device, crew usability and comfort, and future development of a next generation biomonitoring system.","[{""submissionId"":20190001996,""id"":""c1b564c2c7f8482a9653013c68e55767"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190001996,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9d5f012c14f24364984321100aba2932"",""id"":""50cb9c851cc84f7c8e95029d3e382a0f""}],""name"":""2017 Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""9d5f012c14f24364984321100aba2932"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C"",""WBS 046193.01.01.17"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190001996
20150021487,ABSTRACT,Capability for Integrated Systems Risk-Reduction Analysis,"[""Mindock, J."",""Lumpkins, S."",""Shelhamer, M.""]","NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) is working to increase the likelihoods of human health and performance success during long-duration missions, and subsequent crew long-term health. To achieve these goals, there is a need to develop an integrated understanding of how the complex human physiological-socio-technical mission system behaves in spaceflight. This understanding will allow HRP to provide cross-disciplinary spaceflight countermeasures while minimizing resources such as mass, power, and volume. This understanding will also allow development of tools to assess the state of and enhance the resilience of individual crewmembers, teams, and the integrated mission system. We will discuss a set of risk-reduction questions that has been identified to guide the systems approach necessary to meet these needs. In addition, a framework of factors influencing human health and performance in space, called the Contributing Factor Map (CFM), is being applied as the backbone for incorporating information addressing these questions from sources throughout HRP. Using the common language of the CFM, information from sources such as the Human System Risk Board summaries, Integrated Research Plan, and HRP-funded publications has been combined and visualized in ways that allow insight into cross-disciplinary interconnections in a systematic, standardized fashion. We will show examples of these visualizations. We will also discuss applications of the resulting analysis capability that can inform science portfolio decisions, such as areas in which cross-disciplinary solicitations or countermeasure development will potentially be fruitful.","[{""submissionId"":20150021487,""id"":""a5147f7ccca74c0db58929396418a02f"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150021487,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""02aad6f892404e8f94e87c5a8c2818b6""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150021487,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""aa0ff3134a6f450dad948eb48b7d2cd8"",""id"":""feb0f9220b7f4f888be0c72e7a37958a""}],""name"":""2016 Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2016)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""aa0ff3134a6f450dad948eb48b7d2cd8"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150021487

The purpose of this study was to assess mutations arising in human lymphoid cells exposed to protons. Mutations were quantitated at the thymidine kinase (TK1) locus in cell lines derived from the same donor: TK6 cells (wt TP53) and WTK1 cells (mutant TP53). WTK1 cells were much more susceptible to mutagenesis following proton exposure than TK6 cells. Intragenic deletions were observed among early-arising TK1 mutants in TK6 cells, but not in WTK1 cells where all of the mutants arose by LOH. Deletion was the predominant mode of LOH in TK6 cells, while allelic recombination was the major mode of LOH in WTK1 cells. Deletions were of variable lengths, from <1 cM to 64 cM, while mutations that arose by allelic recombination often extended to the telomere. In summary, proton exposures elicited many types of mutations at an autosomal locus in human cells. Most involved large scale loss of genetic information, either through deletion or by recombination.","[{""volume"":""17 Suppl 1"",""submissionId"":20040088534,""issn"":""1120-1797"",""id"":""7d810eadb1b54051b7908ca5b03a8390"",""publicationName"":""Physica medica :  PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088534

The Crew Health and Performance Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CHP-PRA) team uses powerful computational methods to predict mission risk in both domains: medical and performance. Here, we show how CHP-PRA uses the Performance Risk Model (PRisM) to quantify the performance risk and show an application of the model on operationally relevant tasks.

There are various metrics adopted across performance researchers that PRisM can accommodate. For data analysis, interpretation, and integration, we use a method of unifying data from multiple sources by converting each to a single metric. We consult subject matter experts prior to integrating the converted data into PRisM. The method we use is inspired by the Cooper-Harper rating scale [1]. Using this unified metric, we can easily combine data from various tests and lab groups. We explain our conversion method in detail and show how it pertains to the process of testing and validation of PRisM on operational tasks. 

We conducted an initial validation in collaboration with the Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) lab. We test PRisM using data on their operationally relevant task ROBoT-r, a track-and-capture task for grappling incoming resupply vehicles [2]. Several other labs at NASA Johnson Space Center worked together to design 7 Functional Task Tests (FTTs) in pursuit of simulating the tasks required after landing on a planetary surface and after return to Earth [3].

20240001240,PRESENTATION,Human Systems Risk Network - A Ranking Analysis of Risks,"[""Hunter Rehm"",""Caroline Austin"",""Mona Matar"",""Jerry Myers""]","INTRODUCTION
The Human Systems Risk Board (HSRB) is responsible for understanding, managing, and mitigating the risks associated with spaceflight. For a particular mission, the HSRB assigns each human system risk a rating on a 5x5 grid assessing its likelihood and consequence, which is ultimately used to compare and rank the risks. The HSRB approaches risk management by primarily establishing the context of each human system risk individually with the understanding that mitigating one risk might affect the likelihood, consequence, and mitigation approaches of another.  To support this effort the HSRB, subject matter experts, and risk custodian teams created directed acyclic graphs (DAG), often called a causal graph, for the twenty-nine risks. In this presentation, we propose a new ranking algorithm for the risks which includes the downstream influence of each risk according to the information in the DAGs and provide an application of graph theoretic tools. 
 
METHODS
In 2014, Mindock and Klaus proposed a taxonomy for human system risk influences which we have adopted to categorize the nodes in each DAG. Analyzing the nodes that correspond to the risks in this taxonomy allows us to analyze and understand how each risk influences the others. We construct an auxiliary network, which we call the Primary Risk Network (PRN), where the nodes are the twenty-nine space flight risks and, a directed edge connects Risk A to Risk B if Risk A has some influence on the likelihood or consequence of Risk B as described in the DAGS. We perform a variety of graph theoretic ranking methods on the nodes (or risks) in the PRN, including Katz centrality. 

RESULTS
We rank the nodes in the PRN using the Katz centrality score.  The ten risks with the highest score are pictured in Figure 1, colored (light to dark) according to their score. We analyze other centrality measures like betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and the Estrada index, and provide the meaning of the corresponding rankings in terms of the risks. Future work includes analyzing the other categories in the taxonomy defined by Mindock and Klaus [1]. For example, we are interested in analyzing the nodes that are labeled as countermeasures or capabilities and perform similar analysis to measure their effect on certain medical conditions.

20090010097,ABSTRACT,"Humans on the International Space Station-How Research, Operations, and International Collaboration are Leading to New Understanding of Human Physiology and Performance in Microgravity","[""Ronbinson, Julie A."",""Harm, Deborah L.""]","As the International Space Station (ISS) nears completion, and full international utilization is achieved, we are at a scientific crossroads. ISS is the premier location for research aimed at understanding the effects of microgravity on the human body. For applications to future human exploration, it is key for validation, quantification, and mitigation of a wide variety of spaceflight risks to health and human performance. Understanding and mitigating these risks is the focus of NASA s Human Research Program. However, NASA s approach to defining human research objectives is only one of many approaches within the ISS international partnership (including Roscosmos, the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency). Each of these agencies selects and implements their own ISS research, with independent but related objectives for human and life sciences research. Because the science itself is also international and collaborative, investigations that are led by one ISS partner also often include cooperative scientists from around the world. The operation of the ISS generates significant additional data that is not directly linked to specific investigations.

RNA-seq of mice aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days revealed extraordinary hypermutation in tissue-specific genes, with guanine base conversion predominating, potentially contributing to spaceflight-associated health risks. Our results suggest that the genome-wide accelerated mutation that we measured, seemingly independent of radiation dose, was induced by oxidative damage from higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the ISS. This accelerated mutation, faster via RNA transcription than replication and more numerous than by radiation alone, unveils novel hotspots in the mammalian proteome. Notably, these hotspots correlate with commonly mutated genes across various human cancers, highlighting the ISS as a crucial platform for studying accelerated mutation, genome instability, and the induction of disease-causing mutations in model organisms. Our results suggest that metabolic processes can contribute to somatic mutation, and thus may play a role in the development of cancer. A metabolic link to genetic instability potentially has far-reaching implications for various diseases, with implications for human health on Earth and in space.","[{""volume"":""78"",""submissionId"":20240015074,""issue"":""103398"",""publisher"":""Elsevier Science"",""eissn"":""2213-2317"",""id"":""69851df47f2c4427a0a42e6936a7c8b5"",""publicationName"":""Redox Biology"",""publicationDate"":""2024-10-16T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""issuePublicationDate"":""2024-12-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""url"":"""",""doi"":""10.1016/j.redox.2024.103398""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""271118.01.01.10""]",undefined,"[""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240015074

As mission lengths continue to increase, nutrient imbalances due to alterations in intake, dietary requirements, bioavailability, or excretion, may become more important. Factors adversely affecting intake include those as straightforward as stress and as complex as space-adaptation syndrome. Metabolic alterations induced by shifts in fluid and electrolyte balance, neuroendocrine function, and changes in hepatic protein synthesis and skeletal muscle type that result in nutrient partitioning to different biochemical pathways may also affect dietary requirements. Food processing effects on nutrient stability and digestibility, which apply to limited quantities of our usual diet on Earth, may become more important for diets that contain little fresh food during extended-length missions. Whereas nutrient and water recycling through ecosystems is taken for granted on Earth, specific effects of trace contaminant accumulation will require greater attention for prolonged space flights.

20240012762,ABSTRACT,NASA Human Research Program’s Use of AI Technology to Mitigate Exploration Medical Risk,"[""Truong Le"",""Jordan P Blackwelder"",""Kurt L Berens"",""Carlos De Los Santos"",""Jay Lemery""]","<b>INTRODUCTION:</b> NASA’s Human Research Program (HRP) has employed a rigorous approach to understanding and mitigating risk through countermeasure development to optimize crew health and performance. The scope of available artificial intelligence (AI) tools continues to expand at a remarkable pace and the use AI technologies to facilitate human system risk management has presented key opportunities including application in clinical decision support systems (CDSS). 

<b>TOPIC:</b> The Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element of HRP is leading the effort to capitalize on the strengths of AI tools through several current projects (e.g., development of space medicine-literate large language models and updating a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) tool evidence library) are that leverage AI-tools in collaboration with data scientists from Google and Microsoft to improve autonomous CDSS capability. Projects currently in the planning stages seek to foster collaboration across numerous and diverse working groups by removing barriers between organizations and our commercial partners to support the overall Agency AI goals and the vision promulgated by the Agency AI Working Group. Utilizing AI-tools to analyze directed acyclic graphs will help the Human System Risk Board track risks as they evolve from spaceflight hazards to mission-level outcomes. Development of synthetic data sets will allow multi-disciplinary Teams to conduct modeling of astronaut health and performance without the impediments related to data privacy and security. Additional efforts with data systems platforms and improvements to the AI data pipeline are envisioned using the Insight Data platform (a data pipeline “development initiative and process” based on Microsoft best practices). Future endeavors to support CDS involve utilization of commercially available tools and databases using an integrated data systems platform through a Federated, multi-modal AI system. Deployment of such Agentic-AI platforms will considerably benefit the effort to mitigate and ultimately eliminate medical risks while simultaneously reducing crew medical officer cognitive load.

<b>APPLICATION:</b> Implementation of the ExMC AI strategy has enabled creation of AI prototyping in Agile environments to rapidly assess viability of AI tools to reduce development cycle times and accelerate the path toward infusion for operationally relevant solutions for HRP and its stakeholders.","[{""submissionId"":20240012762,""publisher"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""id"":""52a8d34cf84b4243b356b1263121dd27"",""publicationDate"":""2025-06-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240012762,""endDate"":""2025-06-06T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""d0b811ba64ca502c8ec8636b127d210e"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, United States""}},""meetingId"":""177996bf0f764340b9b19b405f95b96a"",""id"":""9abdd40ba69f41a1a38f43ac93394523""}],""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA) 95th Annual Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""Atlanta, GA"",""id"":""177996bf0f764340b9b19b405f95b96a"",""startDate"":""2025-06-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Cybernetics, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics""]","[{""id"":20250004111,""title"":""NASA Human Research Program’s Use of AI Technology to Mitigate Exploration Medical Risk""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240012762
20140013486,ABSTRACT,Assessing the Effect of Spaceflight on the Propensity for Astronauts to Develop Disk Herniation,"[""Feiveson, A. H."",""Mendez, C. M."",""Somers, J. T.""]","BACKGROUND: A previous study [1] reported that the instantaneous risk of developing a Herniated Nucleus Pulposus (HNP) was higher in astronauts who had flown at least one mission, as compared with those in the corps who had not yet flown. However, the study only analyzed time to HNP after the first mission (if any) and did not account for the possible effects of multiple missions. While many HNP's occurred well into astronauts' careers or in some cases years after retirement, the higher incidence of HNPs relatively soon after completion of space missions appears to indicate that spaceflight may lead to an increased risk of HNP. The purpose of this study was to support the Human System Risk Board assessment of back pain, evaluate the risk of injury due to dynamic loads, and update the previous dataset which contained events up to December 31, 2006. METHODS: Data was queried from the electronic medical record and provided by the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health. The data included all 330 United States astronauts from 1959 through February 2014. Cases were confirmed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Computerized Tomography, Myelography, operative findings, or through clinical confirmation with a neurologist or neurosurgeon. In this analysis, astronauts who had an HNP at selection into the corps or had an HNP diagnosis prior to their first flight were excluded. The statistical challenges in using the available data to separate effects of spaceflight from those associated with general astronaut training and lifestyle on propensity to develop HNPs are many. The primary outcome is reported date of first HNP (if any), which at best is only an approximation to the actual time of occurrence. To properly analyze this data with a survival analysis model, one must also know the ""exposure"" time - i.e. how long each astronaut has been at risk for developing an HNP. If an HNP is reported soon after a mission, is it mission caused or general? If the former, exposure time should be counted from the time of landing (assuming the risk of HNP occurring during a mission is zero). If the latter, exposure time should be counted from the time of selection; however we can't directly know which one to use. In our analysis we take both of these possibilities into account with a competing risks model, wherein two distinct stochastic processes are going on: TG = time to HNP (general) and TS = time to HNP (spaceflight). Under this type of model, whichever of these occurs first is what we observe; in other words we don't observe TG or TS, only min(TG, TS). Here, we parameterized the model in terms of separate Weibull hazard functions for each process and estimated all parameters using maximum likelihood. In addition, we allowed for a ""cured fraction"" - i.e. the possibility that some astronauts may never develop an HNP. RESULTS: Results will include a depiction of the competing hazard functions as well as a probability curve for the relative likelihood that an HNP reported at a given time after a mission is actually mission caused. Other factors, such as dwell time in microgravity and vehicle landing environment will be explored. An overall assessment as to whether spaceflight truly exacerbates HNP risk will be made.

Over the past decade, DAP developed models to provide insights into space flight related changes to the central nervous system, cardiovascular system and the musculoskeletal system. Examples of the models and their applications include biomechanical models applied to advanced exercise device development, bone fracture risk quantification for mission planning, accident investigation, bone health standards development, and occupant protection. The International Space Station (ISS), in its role as a testing ground for long duration spaceflight, has been an important platform for obtaining human spaceflight data. DAP has used preflight, in-flight and post-flight data from short and long duration astronauts for computational model development and validation. Examples include preflight and post-flight bone mineral density data, muscle cross-sectional area, and muscle strength measurements. Results from computational modeling supplement space physiology research by informing experimental design. Using these computational models, DAP personnel can easily identify both important factors associated with a phenomenon and areas where data are lacking. This presentation will provide examples of DAP computational models, the data used in model development and validation, and applications of the model.","[{""submissionId"":20170007202,""id"":""61e199a08fc64a9e886ae191358cf4da"",""publicationDate"":""2016-07-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20170007202,""name"":""American Astronautical Society"",""location"":""New York, NY, United States"",""id"":""1219d86b6abc435ea4819464c47e24ad""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170007202,""endDate"":""2016-07-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Astronautical Society"",""location"":""New York, NY, United States""}},""meetingId"":""fb418035120b4c1a908affafbf9f522c"",""id"":""86bf1ed2ee3241b4a56bb748cfded008""}],""name"":""ISS R&D Conference 2016"",""location"":""San Diego, CA"",""id"":""fb418035120b4c1a908affafbf9f522c"",""startDate"":""2016-07-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 516724.01.02.10""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170007202

For example, vehicle or environmental information can be delivered to astronauts through on-body devices and in return wearables provide data to the spacecraft regarding crew health, location, etc. The Wearable Electronics and Applications Research (WEAR) Lab at the NASA Johnson Space Center utilizes a collaborative approach between engineering and human factors to investigate the use of wearables for spaceflight. Zero and partial gravity environments present unique challenges to wearables that require collaborative, user-centered, and iterative approaches to the problems. Examples of the WEAR Lab's recent wearable projects for spaceflight will be discussed.","[{""submissionId"":20170002914,""id"":""3c55f0e718e147cfada6c0d926049a45"",""publicationDate"":""2017-10-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20170002914,""name"":""Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"",""location"":""Santa Monica, CA, United States"",""id"":""221cfb02274a4ee29406f1a41622a155""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170002914,""endDate"":""2017-10-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"",""location"":""Santa Monica, CA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""88e1a1751a5a43ffb9d8e841c8421acf"",""id"":""6e0fc338ec8649f28b870c97b72dd17e""}],""name"":""International Annual Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES) Meeting 2017"",""location"":""Austin, TX"",""id"":""88e1a1751a5a43ffb9d8e841c8421acf"",""startDate"":""2017-10-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support"",""Space Communications, Spacecraft Communications, Command And Tracking""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170002914
20090019087,PRESENTATION,Renal Stone Risk during Spaceflight: Assessment and Countermeasure Validation,"[""Whitson, Peggy A."",""Pietrzyk, Robert A."",""Jones, Jeffery A."",""Sams, Clarence F."",""Hudson, Ed K."",""Nelman-Gonzalez, Mayra""]","NASA's Vision for Space Exploration centers on exploration class missions including the goals of returning to the moon and landing on Mars. One of NASA's objectives is to focus research on astronaut health and the development of countermeasures that will protect crewmembers during long duration voyages. Exposure to microgravity affects human physiology and results in changes in the urinary chemical composition favoring urinary supersaturation and an increased risk of stone formation. Nephrolithiasis is a multifactorial disease and development of a renal stone is significantly influenced by both dietary and environmental factors. Previous results from long duration Mir and short duration Shuttle missions have shown decreased urine volume, pH, and citrate levels and increased calcium. Citrate, an important inhibitor of calcium-containing stones, binds with urinary calcium reducing the amount of calcium available to form stones. Citrate inhibits renal stone recurrence by preventing crystal growth, aggregation, and nucleation and is one of the most common therapeutic agents used to prevent stone formation. Methods: Thirty long duration crewmembers (29 male, 1 female) participated in this study. 24-hour urines were collected and dietary monitoring was performed pre-, in-, and postflight. Crewmembers in the treatment group received two potassium citrate (KCIT) pills, 10 mEq/pill, ingested daily beginning 3 days before launch, all in-flight days and through 14 days postflight. Urinary biochemical and dietary analyses were completed. Results: KCIT treated subjects exhibited decreased urinary calcium excretion and maintained the levels of calcium oxalate supersaturation risk at their preflight levels. The increased urinary pH levels in these subjects reduced the risk of uric acid stones. Discussion: The current study investigated the use of potassium citrate as a countermeasure to minimize the risk of stone formation during ISS missions. Results suggest that supplementation with potassium citrate decreases the risk of stone formation during and immediately after spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":20090019087,""id"":""43fbfc79dd7742e1abb135f300c1a6be"",""publicationDate"":""2009-05-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20090019087,""endDate"":""2009-05-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association Meeting"",""location"":""Los Angeles, CA"",""id"":""ff176dc2a5fa4fa1b537cad361328480"",""startDate"":""2009-05-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090019087
20150003001,ABSTRACT,The Effects of Long Duration Bed Rest as a Spaceflight Analogue on Resting State Sensorimotor Network Functional Connectivity and Neurocognitive Performance,"[""Cassady, K."",""Koppelmans, V."",""Yuan, P."",""Cooke, K."",""De Dios, Y."",""Stepanyan, V."",""Szecsy, D."",""Gadd, N."",""Wood, S."",""Reuter-Lorenz, P."",""Castenada, R. Riascos"",""Kofman, I."",""Bloomberg, J."",""Mulavara, A."",""Seidler, R.""]","Long duration spaceflight has been associated with detrimental alterations in human sensorimotor systems and neurocognitive performance. Prolonged exposure to a head-down tilt position during long duration bed rest can resemble several effects of the microgravity environment such as reduced sensory inputs, body unloading and increased cephalic fluid distribution. The question of whether microgravity affects other central nervous system functions such as brain functional connectivity and its relationship with neurocognitive performance is largely unknown, but of potential importance to the health and performance of astronauts both during and post-flight. The aims of the present study are 1) to identify changes in sensorimotor resting state functional connectivity that occur with extended bed rest exposure, and to characterize their recovery time course; 2) to evaluate how these neural changes correlate with neurocognitive performance. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data were collected from 17 male participants. The data were acquired through the NASA bed rest facility, located at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX). Participants remained in bed with their heads tilted down six degrees below their feet for 70 consecutive days. RsfMRI data were obtained at seven time points: 7 and 12 days before bed rest; 7, 50, and 65 days during bed rest; and 7 and 12 days after bed rest. Functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) analysis was performed to measure the connectivity of sensorimotor networks in the brain before, during, and post-bed rest. We found a decrease in left putamen connectivity with the pre- and post-central gyri from pre bed rest to the last day in bed rest. In addition, vestibular cortex connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex decreased from pre to post bed rest. Furthermore, connectivity between cerebellar right superior posterior fissure and other cerebellar regions decreased from pre bed rest to the last day in bed rest. In contrast, connectivity within the default mode network remained stable over the course of bed rest. We also utilized a battery of behavioral measures including spatial working memory tasks and measures of functional mobility and balance. These behavioral measurements were collected before, during, and after bed rest. We will report the preliminary findings of correlations observed between brain functional connectivity and behavioral performance changes. Our results suggest that sensorimotor brain networks exhibit decoupling with extended periods of reduced usage. The findings from this study could aid in the understanding and future design of targeted countermeasures to alleviate the detrimental health and neurocognitive effects of long-duration spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":20150003001,""id"":""516ec2fa25ca487fa488d2d7cf3c958d"",""publicationDate"":""2015-04-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150003001,""endDate"":""2015-04-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0a7910919c984fd4bd8f8e1378216707"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Society for the Neural Control of Movement"",""location"":""Worldwide""}},""meetingId"":""46ef3001954e4900ba19ebe8374f7b44"",""id"":""57a29d8f7fcc4c4fbe24fade87d69b9d""}],""name"":""Annual Neural Control of Movement Conference 2015"",""location"":""Charleston, SC"",""id"":""46ef3001954e4900ba19ebe8374f7b44"",""startDate"":""2015-04-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""1UL1RR029876-01"",""NCC9-58"",""NNX11AR02G""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150003001

Ten astronauts (9 men, 1 woman) from two space shuttle missions (9- and 10-day duration) participated in the study. Blood samples were collected 10 days before launch, within 3 h after landing, and 3 days after landing. All peripheral blood mononuclear cell preparations were cryopreserved and analyzed simultaneously in a 4-h cytotoxicity (51)Cr release assay using K562 target cells. NMHC killer cell lytic activity was normalized per 1,000 CD56+ cells. When all 10 subjects were considered as one study group, NMHC killer cell numbers did not change significantly during the three sampling periods, but at landing lytic activity had decreased by approximately 40% (P < 0.05) from preflight values. Nine of ten astronauts had decreased lytic activity immediately after flight. NMHC killer cell cytotoxicity of only three astronauts returned toward preflight values by 3 days after landing. Consistent with decreased NMHC killer cell cytotoxicity, urinary cortisol significantly increased after landing compared with preflight levels. Plasma cortisol and ACTH levels at landing were not significantly different from preflight values. No correlation of changes in NMHC killer cell function or hormone levels with factors such as age, gender, mission, or spaceflight experience was found. After landing, expression of the major lymphocyte surface markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD16, CD56), as determined by flow cytometric analysis, did not show any consistent changes from measurements made before flight.","[{""volume"":""91"",""submissionId"":20040088755,""issue"":""4"",""issn"":""8750-7587"",""id"":""f2cc32f8c231415aac966770fec15a79"",""publicationName"":""Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. :  1985)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088755

A.""]","Biospecimen Sharing Programs (BSPs) have been organized by NASA Ames Research Center since the 1960s with the goal of maximizing utilization and scientific return from rare, complex and costly spaceflight experiments. BSPs involve acquiring otherwise unused biological specimens from primary space research experiments for distribution to secondary experiments. Here we describe a collaboration leveraging Ames expertise in biospecimen sharing to magnify the scientific impact of research informing astronaut health funded by the NASA Human Research Program (HRP) Human Health Countermeasures (HHC) Element. The concept expands biospecimen sharing to one-off ground-based studies utilizing analogue space platforms (e.g., Hind limb Unloading (HLU), Artificial Gravity) for rodent experiments, thereby significantly broadening the range of research opportunities with translational relevance for protecting human health in space and on Earth. In this presentation, we will report on biospecimens currently being acquired from HHC Award Head-Down Tilt as a Model for Intracranial and Intraocular Pressures, and Retinal Changes during Spaceflight, and their availability. The BSP add-on to the project described herein has already yielded for HHC-funded investigators more than 4,700 additional tissues that would otherwise have been discarded as waste, with additional tissues available for analysis. Young (3-mo old) male and female rats and Older (9-mo old) male rats are being exposed to HLU for either 7, 14, 28, or 90 days. Additional groups are exposed to 90 days of unloading followed by either 7, 14, 28 days or 90 days of recovery (normal loading). Comparisons are made with non-suspended controls. Unused tissues are: Skin, Lungs, Thymus, Adrenals, Kidneys, Spleen, Hindlimb Muscles (Soleus, Extensor Digitorum Longus, Tibialis Anterior, Plantaris Gastrocnemius), Fat Pads, Reproductive Organs, and Intestines. Tissues are harvested, weighed, preserved then archived (with metadata) using a sample tracking system (CryoTrack). Preservation techniques include snap-freezing and RNALatersnap-freezing. Specimens were weighed at the time of dissection, and organ mass: body mass ratios analyzed to determine unloading effects across conditions and durations. The results corroborate previously reported effects of short-term exposure to microgravity or unloading exposure on various organs, and provide new insights into adaptation to long-duration unloading relevant to sustained spaceflight exposures on ISS.

The Human System Risk Board (HSRB), a Health and Medical Technical Authority (HMTA) Board at NASA Johnson Space Center, is the entity responsible for identifying, assessing, analyzing, and monitoring the official understanding of the risk or risk posture for each of the Human System Risks and determining – based on evaluation of the available evidence – when that risk posture changes. The ultimate purpose of tracking and researching these risks is to find ways to reduce the risk that astronaut crews face during spaceflight. Historically, research, development and operations relevant to one risk have been conducted in isolation from other risks; these individual risk ‘silos’ enabled initial characterization of each specific risk. In spaceflight however, the impact of exposure to risk for astronaut crews is cumulative, and not independent of exposures or other risks, as all the adverse effects of the spaceflight environment begin at launch, continue throughout the duration of the mission and in some cases across the lifetime of the crews. In January of 2020, the HSRB at NASA embarked on a pilot project designed to assess the potential value of causal diagramming as a tool to facilitate understanding these cumulative and interdependent effects as applied within Human System Risk management. This process uses directed acyclic graphs as a means of formalizing a shared mental model of the causal flow of risk among Risk Board stakeholders. Initially this model was to improve communication among those stakeholders, but the potential value exceeds communication alone. Formalization of the process for creating these causal diagrams will enable the creation of a composite risk network that is vetted by members of the NASA community and configuration managed. The causal diagrams are formulated as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to function as a type of knowledge graph for reference for the board and its stakeholders. This document outlines the pilot process, the standardized approaches, and guidance for risk custodian teams when creating and updating DAGs as a part of the NASA Human System Risk Management process.

20150008177,OTHER,Risk of Crew Adverse Health Event Due to Altered Immune Response,"[""Crucian, Brian"",""Kunz, Hawley"",""Sams, Clarence F.""]","Determining the effect of space travel on the human immune system has proven to be extremely challenging. Limited opportunities for in-flight studies, varying mission durations, technical and logistical obstacles, small subject numbers, and a broad range of potential assays have contributed to this problem. Additionally, the inherent complexity of the immune system, with its vast array of cell populations, sub-populations, diverse regulatory molecules, and broad interactions with other physiological systems, makes determining precise variables to measure very difficult. There is also the challenge of determining the clinical significance of any observed immune alterations. Will such a change lead to disease, or is it a transient subclinical observation related to short-term stress? The effect of this problem may be observed by scanning publications associated with immunity and spaceflight, which began to appear during the 1970s. Although individually they are each valid studies, the comprehensive literature to date suffers from widely varying sampling methods and assay techniques, low subject counts, and sometimes a disparate focus on narrow aspects of immunity. The most clinically relevant data are derived from in-flight human studies, which have demonstrated altered cell-mediated immunity and reactivation of latent herpes viruses. Much more data are available from post-flight testing of humans, with clear evidence of altered cytokine production patterns, altered leukocyte distribution, continued latent viral reactivation, and evidence of dramatically altered virus-specific immunity. It is unknown if post-flight assessments relate to the in-flight condition or are a response to landing stress and readaptation. In-flight culture of cells has clearly demonstrated that immune cells are gravity-sensitive and display altered functional characteristics. It is unknown if these data are related to in vivo immune cell function or are an artifact of microgravity culture. Ground analog testing of humans and animals, as well as microgravity-analog cell culture, has demonstrated utility. However, in all cases, it is not known with certainty if these data would reflect similar testing during space travel. Given their ready availability, ground analogs may be extremely useful for assay development and the evaluation of potential countermeasures. In general, the evidence base suffers from widely disparate studies on small numbers of subjects that do not directly correlate well with each other or spaceflight itself. Also lacking are investigations of the effect of gender on adaption to spaceflight. This results in significant knowledge 'gaps' that must be filled by future studies to completely determine any clinical risk related to immunity for human exploration-class space missions. These gaps include a significant lack of in-flight data, particularly during long-duration space missions. The International Space Station represents an excellent science platform with which to address this knowledge gap. Other knowledge gaps include lack of a single validated ground analog for the phenomenon and a lack of flight-compatible laboratory equipment capable of monitoring astronauts (for either clinical or research purposes). However, enough significant data exist, as described in this manuscript, to warrant addressing this phenomenon during the utilization phase of the ISS. A recent Space Shuttle investigation has confirmed the 31 in-flight nature of immune dysregulation, demonstrating that it is not merely a post-flight phenomenon. Several current studies are ongoing onboard the ISS that should thoroughly characterize the phenomenon. NASA recognizes that if spaceflight-associated immune dysregulation persists during exploration flights in conjunction with other dangers, such as high-energy radiation, the result may be a significant clinical risk. This emphasizes the need for a continued integrated comprehensive approach to determining the effect of prolonged spaceflight, separated from transient launch and landing stresses, on human immunity.

20250004499,PREPRINT,Revision of Spacecraft Allowable Maximum Concentrations for Acetaldehyde,"[""Edward Spencer Williams"",""Cynthia M Tapia"",""Valerie E Ryder""]","Introduction

Spaceflight maximum allowable concentrations (SMACs) were previously developed for acetaldehyde in 1994. Acetaldehyde is commonly detected at low levels on the International Space Station, and at higher concentrations it might be expected to cause respiratory and eye irritation. Since 1994, numerous exposure studies in human volunteers and laboratory animals have deepened our understanding of potential effects associated with exposure to acetaldehyde vapor.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using principles of systematic review to identify toxicological data on acetaldehyde published since 1994. This search was supplemented by the use of summary sources for setting of other safety values (i.e., EPA AEGLs, IRIS values, occupational limits, etc.).

Results and Discussion

The thirteen primary toxicology studies identified in this exercise prompted a re-evaluation of SMACs for all durations. The proposed values will appropriately protect astronaut health and performance and provide critical information for design of life support systems for low Earth orbit and beyond.","[{""submissionId"":20250004499,""issn"":""2375-6314"",""publisher"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""eissn"":""2375-6322"",""id"":""f598053b6dbf4025b068f20e5b4a0d7d"",""publicationName"":""Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance"",""publicationDate"":""2025-06-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250004499

HFBP-EM were collected during Human Exploration Research Analogs (HERA) campaigns 4 (C4) and 5 (C5), and during SIRIUS 17 and 19 missions in the Russian Ground Based Experiment Complex, NEK, to document the feasibility, flexibility, and acceptability of these measures in analogsof the spaceflight environment. A subset of the HFBP-EM suite was collected during spaceflight as part HRP’s Standard Measures in Spaceflight Project. Whenever possible, the HFBP-EM protocol and measures are kept the same across studies, however, differences across research settings (e.g., experimental manipulations, mission scenarios, mission length) and implementation of the measures require the data are harmonized to ensure comparable views across missions. The purpose of our project is to develop a harmonized database of HFBP-EM data from different settings, and to summarize the trajectory of behavioral health and performance within and between research settings. In this presentation, we will summarize the harmonized dataset and the trajectory of measures related to the Team Risk, including team performance, team cohesion, team processes, and psychological safety, over time and between and within settings.METHODSWe followed best practices for data harmonization. Characteristics of each research setting were assessed for harmonization potential, and we deemed NEK-SIRIUS 17 as inappropriate due to study aims, length, and data quality. Common variables of interest were identified. Study characteristics and key variables with which datafiles could be merged were defined as “meta-data.” HFBP-EM data from all settings were processed under a common format. We then created a harmonized team-level database designed to facilitate analyses that address HRP research gaps related to HRP’s Team risk. In this database, team cohesion, processes, performance, psychological safety, and group living were operationalized as the team mean of the crew responses for each data collection (e.g., on mission day 7). Data collected on the International Space Station (ISS) included a subset of scale items administered to participants. Data collected from ISS team members within +/- 7 days of the first data collection and every following 30 +/-4 days were aggregated to the team level. We generated figures that display the mean and variability of team constructs across research settings. We also generated plots of changes in team constructs with mission day and with percentage of the mission completed. Where possible, we compared data from spaceflight analogs with data from astronauts aboard the ISS.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe team-level harmonized database was structured such that each row represents data for a team on a specific mission day. Team constructs (e.g., team cohesion) were included as columns (i.e., wide format) with repeated measures across mission days given in rows (i.e., long format). The database included data from 18 crews: five, 4-person American crews in HERA C4, four 4-person American crews in HERA C5, one 6-person multinational crew in NEK-SIRIUS 19, and eight, 2–11-person multinational crews aboard the ISS. Results provide insights into mission and campaign differences in team functioning and performance. For example, between campaign differences were observed for team processes—the interdependent team actions that orchestrate taskwork in pursuit of the team’s goals [1]. Greater between-team variability on team processes was detected during HERA C4 than during C5, and a downward trend was observed over the duration of C4, but not C5 or SIRIUS 19. This may be due to the campaign-level differences such as the sleep deprivation implemented during C4. Responses on the subset of team process items administered on the ISS indicate between-crew variability more like those observed in C4 than C5 and NEK, with some, but not all ISS crews demonstrating a downward trend over time. Additional findings will be presented. REFERENCESMarks, M. A., et al (2001) Academy of Management Review, 26(3), 356-376.

In addition, there are limited clinical and research data to inform development and implementation of therapeutics for these unique health risks. In this light, NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) is leveraging biomedical computational models and simulations (M&S) to help inform, predict, assess and mitigate spaceflight health and performance risks, and enhance countermeasure development. To ensure that these M&S can be applied with confidence to the space environment, it is imperative to incorporate a rigorous verification, validation and credibility assessment (VV&C) processes to ensure that the computational tools are sufficiently reliable to answer questions within their intended use domain. In this presentation, we will discuss how NASA's Integrated Medical Model (IMM) and Digital Astronaut Project (DAP) have successfully adapted NASA's Standard for Models and Simulations, NASA-STD-7009 (7009) to achieve this goal. These VV&C methods are also being leveraged by organization such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institute of Health (NIH) and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) to establish new M&S VV&C standards and guidelines for healthcare applications. Similarly, we hope to provide some insight to the greater aerospace medicine community on how to develop and implement M&S with sufficient confidence to augment medical research and operations.","[{""submissionId"":20140017016,""id"":""aa007faa5e39411a9dcf8acfe8ddf2a0"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140017016,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States"",""id"":""b56241feb80f4df69db4367d62745781""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140017016,""endDate"":""2015-05-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""8398b20434f64633a8f97e439dd6c988"",""id"":""8e09280f32674f01b5ded53773cec78a""}],""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA) Annual Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""Lake Buena Vista, FL"",""id"":""8398b20434f64633a8f97e439dd6c988"",""startDate"":""2015-05-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Computer Programming And Software""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140017016

20200002128,OTHER,"Integrated Research Plan to Assess the Combined Effects of Space Radiation, Altered Gravity, and Isolation and Confinement on Crew Health and Performance: Problem Statement","[""Steinberg, Susan L.""]","Future crewed exploration missions to Mars could last up to three years and will expose astronauts to unprecedented environmental challenges. Challenges to the nervous system during these missions will include factors of: space radiation that can damage sensitive neurons in the central nervous system (CNS); isolation and confinement can affect cognition and behavior; and altered gravity that will change the astronauts’ perception of their environment and their spatial orientation, and will affect their coordination, balance, and locomotion. In the past, effects of spaceflight stressors have been characterized individually. However, long-term, simultaneous exposure to multiple stressors will produce a range of interrelated behavioral and biological effects that have the potential to adversely affect operationally relevant crew performance. These complex environmental challenges might interact synergistically and increase the overall risk to the health and performance of the astronaut. Therefore, NASA’s Human Research Program (HRP) has directed an integrated approach to characterize and mitigate the risk to the CNS from simultaneous exposure to these multiple spaceflight factors. The proposed research strategy focuses on systematically evaluating the relationships among three existing research risks associated with spaceflight: Risk of Acute (In-flight) and Late Central Nervous System Effects from Radiation (CNS), Risk of Adverse Cognitive or Behavioral Conditions and Psychiatric Disorders (BMed), and Risk of Impaired Control of Spacecraft/Associated Systems and Decreased Mobility Due to Vestibular/Sensorimotor Alterations Associated with Spaceflight (SM). NASA’s HRP approach is intended to identify the magnitude and types of interactions as they affect behavior, especially as it relates to operationally relevant performance (e.g., performance that depends on reaction time, procedural memory, etc.). In order to appropriately characterize this risk of multiple spaceflight environmental stressors, there is a recognition of the need to leverage research approaches using appropriate animal models and behavioral constructs. Very little has been documented on the combined effects of altered gravity, space radiation, and other psychological and cognitive stressors on the CNS. Preliminary evidence from rodents suggest that a combination of a minimum of exposures to even two of three stressors of: simulated space radiation, simulated microgravity, and simulated isolation and confinement, have produced different and more pronounced biological and performance effects than exposure to these same stressors individually. Structural and functional changes to the CNS of rodents exposed to transdisciplinary combined stressors indicate that important processes related to information processing are likely altered including impairment of exploratory and risk taking behaviors, as well as executive function including learning, memory, and cognitive flexibility — all of which may be linked to changes in related operational relevant performance. The fully integrated research plan outlines approaches to evaluate how combined, potentially synergistic, impacts of simultaneous exposures to spaceflight hazards will affect an astronaut’s CNS and their operationally relevant performance during future exploration missions, including missions to the Moon and Mars. The ultimate goals are to derive risk estimates for the combined, potentially synergistic, effects of the three major spaceflight hazards that will establish acceptable maximum decrement or change in a physiological or behavioral parameters during or after spaceflight, the acceptable limit of exposure to a spaceflight factor, and to evaluate strategies to mitigate any associated decrements in operationally relevant performance.

This study explores the potential to grow crops for consumption on the International Space Station (ISS) using the Veggie vegetable-production system.  VEG-04A and B were two flight tests conducted in 2019 with the leafy green crop Mizuna mustard.  Mizuna was grown in two Veggie chambers simultaneously, with the chambers set to different red-to-blue light formulations; one Veggie was programmed as “red-rich” and the second as “blue-rich.”  Light quality is known to impact plant growth, nutrition, microbiology, and organoleptic characteristics on Earth, and the Veggie flight tests examined how these impacts might differ in microgravity.  VEG-04A was a 35-day growth test with a single harvest.  VEG-04B, a 58-day test with harvests at four, six, and eight weeks from the same plants, assessed sustained productivity.  Challenges with the watering program occurred early during VEG-04A, and several plants failed to survive in both the flight and ground control operations.  Thus, prior to VEG-04B, an extra test was conducted to tailor water timing and volumes.  This test allowed a fine tuning of methods for VEG-04B, and generally plant survival was better in that experiment.

Retinal vessels in astronauts and BR subjects are monitored by Heidelberg Spectralis infrared (IR) imaging, in which retinal image quality is limited by insufficient resolution of small vessels. Yet small vessels respond and remodel most actively to physiological stress.For our NASA study of BR subjects, we identify retinal image quality as thecapability to capture vascular detail to acceptable resolution of small vessels. We therefore are analyzing Spectralis images acquired with fluorescein angiography(FA), where increased contrast significantly improves image resolution.

Surveys captured the amount of time spent on different plant-related operations, enjoyment of the different activities, engagement with Veggie, experience interacting with Veggie, and sensory stimulation associated with growing plants in Veggie.

Within each study, plant growth did not differ across light treatment or location (flight versus ground).  In general, more biomass was produced in most treatments during the longer study, but growth of this crop declined over time with the repeated harvests.  On average, bacterial and fungal counts were significantly lower on ground control samples than flight samples, and microbial counts increased with repeated harvests.  Light treatment did not influence any elements in tissues tested; however, the growth duration did impact levels of several elements.  Organoleptic scores were generally higher in flight, and ground tasters considered samples more bitter.  Amount of interaction and responses to Veggie varied widely by individual.  Enjoyable tasks had higher impact than non-enjoyable tasks and interacting with Veggie was generally viewed as positive.  These tests on ISS are helping to mitigate the risk of an inadequate food supply for long-duration missions by adding fresh vegetables and key nutrients to the crew diet, and indicating which plant care activities are providing behavioral health benefits for the crew. This research was co-funded by the Human Research Program and Space Biology (MTL#1075) in the ILSRA 2015 NRA call.

Three indices of instability were used: intraclonal karyotypic heterogeneity, mutation rate analysis at the thymidine kinase (TK1) locus, and re-cloning efficiency. Fifteen of sixty clones demonstrated karyotypic heterogeneity. Five clones had multiple indicators of karyotypic change. One clone was markedly hypomutable and polyploid. Six clones were hypomutable, while 21 clones were mutators. Of these, seven were karyotypically unstable. Six clones had low re-cloning efficiencies, one of which was a mutator.

In summary, many clones that survived exposure to a low fluence of Fe ions manifested one or more forms of genomic instability that may hasten the development of neoplasia through deletion or by recombination.","[{""volume"":""17 Suppl 1"",""submissionId"":20040088533,""issn"":""1120-1797"",""id"":""0f99df69179c43f6ba47068c839fe623"",""publicationName"":""Physica medica :  PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""CA 73966""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088533
20240012033,ABSTRACT,"Habitability and Human Factors Assessment (iSHORT, SHAQ, and SHU)","[""J C W Miller"",""M FarrHenderson"",""I W T Robertson"",""S T Bell"",""L B Landon""]","<b>BACKGROUND</b>
As long-duration off-planet habitats become a reality, a consideration of habitability and human factors (HF) is crucial. The habitat is more than just a place to live and work. It is also the crew’s perception of the space, and the psychological impacts of size, layout, and usage over time; all of which can support or strain behavioral health and performance (BHP). 

A previous International Space Station (ISS) habitability study used the iSHORT (Space Habitability Observation Reporting Tool) to collect detailed data about habitability and human factors and inform NASA Standards. Of the previous iSHORT study, only one of the six ISS subjects had a duration of one year; all other ISS and ground analog subjects had shorter mission durations from one week to six months. It is necessary to collect new data with a focus on long-duration exploration missions of > 6 months and on planetary surface habitat design. New data is also needed to compare the iSHORT to other habitability measures. One measure, the SHAQ (Subjective Habitability and Acceptability Questionnaire), assesses the intersection of psychology and habitability. Another complementary measure, the Scale for Habitat Usability (SHU), is a brief subjective scale that captures how habitat design impacts perceived usability of the built environment in relation to task performance. 

<b>OBJECTIVE</b>
Our study aims to (1) understand how individual well-being and team dynamics may relate to HF concerns over time, (2) capture how habitability and HF change over time, (3) compare the three habitability measures (iSHORT, SHAQ, SHU), (4) assess habitats to capture HF design concerns and related BHP impacts of a planetary habitat, and (5) inform future standards for HF design. 

<b>METHOD</b>
Data are being collected on crews living and working in long-duration spaceflight analogs. Individual-level data collections are repeated at regular intervals throughout the missions on several habitat areas, activities, and key equipment (i.e., points of interest). These points of interest (POIs) include the kitchen/galley, crew quarters, and other work and living areas. Assessments include evaluations of privacy, comfort, convenience, control, efficiency, and social density through the lens of subsequent outcomes like sleep, individual performance, group activities performance, stress, mood, and social interactions. Pre- and post-mission evaluations will also allow comparison with homes, pre- and post-mission hotels, and a retrospective reflection of living and working in a long-duration analog.

<b>INITIAL DATA COLLECTIONS</b>
In this poster, we will describe the measures and data yield. Since the research protocol was designed, the study team has collected iSHORT Standalone four times, nine collections of SHAQ, and three collections of iSHORT with SHAQ. Data collection is ongoing.

<b>SUMMARY</b>
A novel assessment suite has been developed to further aid the comparison and complementary understanding of the habitability and human factors measures, which will allow for efficient deployment of these measures in analogs and/or spaceflight in near-term research as well as support well-being and performance through design.","[{""submissionId"":20240012033,""id"":""cdf440b9f24648309374b01c3be859a8"",""publicationDate"":""2025-01-28T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240012033,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""bb40d336e33948dbb3659f5827d0f089"",""id"":""75b3d5579f5240bb977cbf078c9bc05a""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""bb40d336e33948dbb3659f5827d0f089"",""url"":""https://www.nasa.gov/hrp-iws-2025/"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B"",""10449.2.03.08.33.1737""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240012033
20160001747,ABSTRACT,Development and Provision of Functional Foods to Promote Health on Long-Duration Space Missions,"[""Bermudez-Aguirre, D. "",""Cooper, M. R. "",""Douglas, G. "",""Smith, S. ""]","During long-duration NASA space missions, such as proposed missions to Mars, astronauts may experience negative physiological effects such as bone loss. Functional foods such as high-lycopene, high-flavonoids and high-omega-3 products and fruits and vegetables may mitigate the negative effects of spaceflight on physiological factors including the bone health of crewmembers. Previous studies showed that current ISS provisions provide high-lycopene and high-omega-3 food items but the variety is limited, which could promote menu fatigue. Bioactive compounds can degrade like other chemical compounds and lose functionality. The native concentrations and stability of bioactive compounds have never been determined in spaceflight foods, and adequate information is not available for commercial products for the storage durations required for space exploration (5 years). The purpose of this task is to develop new spaceflight foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids, lycopene, or flavonoids, identify commercial products with these bioactive compounds that meet spaceflight requirements, and define the stability of these nutrients in storage to enable purposeful functional food incorporation into the space food system. The impact of storage temperature on the stability of lutein, lycopene, beta-carotene, omega-3 fatty acids, phenolics, anthocyanins and sterols is being studied in 12 ISS menu items stored at three different temperatures (4, 21, 35 degree C) over 2 years. Additionally, nutrient and quality stability are being assessed on a larger food set stored at 21 degree C over 2 years that contains twelve newly developed foods, 10 commercial products repackaged to spaceflight requirements, and another 5 current ISS menu items expected to be good sources of omega-3 fatty acids, lycopene, or flavonoids. All items were shipped overnight to the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University (Corvalis, OR) after processing and 1-year of storage and analyzed for bioactive compound concentrations. Sensory evaluation was conducted on the newly developed functional foods and commercial products with untrained panelists (n is greater than or equal to 25) using a 9-point Hedonic scale to test sensory attributes and overall acceptability after processing and 1-year of storage (21 degree C). Repeat nutritional and sensory analyses will be conducted in the same foods after the 2-year storage period is completed. The stability of bioactive compounds in the selected foods was dependent on storage temperature and food matrix. Omega-3 showed excellent stability in the analyzed products after 1-year of storage, regardless of the storage temperature; phenolic compounds also showed good stability. Lycopene was more stable in oil-based products rather than water-based products because of the protection that lipids offer to lycopene molecules. Also, lycopene was more stable in freeze-dried products than in high moisture foods. The 12 newly developed functional foods showed good overall acceptability in sensory attributes after processing (average score 7.2 out of 9.0) and maintained sensory quality through 1-year (21 degree C); the overall acceptability was on average 7.1 after storage. Similar behavior was observed for the 10 commercial products after 1 year. The developed products are good sources of omega-3 (both plant and marine), vegetables (7 vegetable-based products), and good sources of carotenoids, such as the Curry Pumpkin Soup and the Sweet and Savory Kale. Nine of the new products, such as Mango Salad, Pickled Beets, and Braised Red Cabbage, are rich in phenolic compounds. Stability of most of the studied nutrients seems to be adequate after 1-year of storage in most of the tested foods. However, storage temperature of the food must be considered during long-duration space missions to achieve stability of all nutrients. Likewise, more information is needed regarding nutrient retention after 2-years of storage to identify nutritional gaps that may be expected over the 5-year shelf life required for a Mars mission. New developed products will be filling a gap in the current space food system to minimize menu fatigue, provide specific nutrients to reduce the negative effects of long-duration space missions and maintain crew members' health. Information about bioactive compounds in developed products after 1-year and 2-year of storage will provide the knowledge base for further product development.","[{""submissionId"":20160001747,""id"":""0148e604c4f4431e96ba89548dacf64d"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160001747,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b1989267ed754dfab0ecffda3f338882"",""id"":""00e3dd3a95634d6fa26cd6613c861180""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""b1989267ed754dfab0ecffda3f338882"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160001747
20140013481,ABSTRACT,"Probiotics in the Space Food System: Delivery, Microgravity Effects, and the Potential Benefit to Crew Health","[""Castro, S. L."",""Ott, C. M."",""Douglas, G. L.""]","As mission distance and duration increase, the need grows for non‐invasive disease prevention and immunomodulation, especially given the limited medical response capability expected for these missions and the immune dysregulation documented in crew. Additionally, changes in diet, lifestyle, antibiotic usage, and the environmental stresses during spaceflight may alter crewmembers' intestinal microbiome. The addition of probiotic bacteria to the space food system is expected to confer immunostimulatory benefits on crewmembers, with the potential to counteract the immune dysregulation that has been documented in spaceflight. Based on previous studies that demonstrated unique microbiological responses to the low shear environment of spaceflight, probiotic organisms hold the potential to induce enhanced beneficial responses through mechanisms, such as beneficial interactions with human immune cells and repression of colonization of pathogens on the mucosa. The work presented here will begin to address two research gaps related to providing probiotics in spaceflight: 1) delivery, and 2) the effect of the low shear microgravity environment on probiotic attributes. The probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus was selected for investigation due to its wide commercial use and documented benefits that include inhibition of virulence related gene expression in pathogens and mucosal stimulation of immune cells. The delivery system for probiotics has not been determined for spaceflight, where the food system is shelf stable and the lack of refrigeration prevents the use of traditional dairy delivery methods. In order to demonstrate the potential of the space food system to deliver viable probiotic bacteria to crewmembers, the probiotic L. acidophilus was packaged in high barrier flight packaging in nonfat dry milk (NFDM) or retained in commercial capsule form. Viable cells were enumerated over 8 months of storage at 22, 4, and ‐80ºC. The survival of L. acidophilus rehydrated in NFDM, in a PBS control, and directly from the capsule was also evaluated following stress challenge with simulated gastric and intestinal juices to determine the method that would deliver the most viable cells to the intestine, where they would be expected to confer beneficial effects. L. acidophilus was found to be stable to gastric and intestinal juice challenge when delivered in rehydrated NFDM, even after two hours of exposure. In comparison, L. acidophilus was reduced by 1‐5 logs when exposed to gastric and intestinal juice directly and when rehydrated in a PBS control. Shelf life data indicated that L. acidophilus would require refrigerated or frozen storage to remain viable at adequate levels over the multi‐year storage periods required for spaceflight. This study suggests that the protective effect provided by the dairy matrix, and not merely rehydration prior to consumption, extends probiotic viability and stress tolerance during storage in spaceflight and in simulated digestion conditions more adequately than a capsule. In addition to effective delivery, it is essential to understand the microgravity effects on the stress tolerances and genetic expression of probiotic bacteria to enable optimization of growth, survival, strain selection, and conferred benefits in spaceflight. In our current study, ground‐based characterization of the growth, stress response, and transcriptomic response of L. acidophilus will be accomplished using the low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) culture environment in the rotating wall vessel (RWV). We hypothesize that L. acidophilus will maintain or improve its growth and stress response following culture in the LSMMG environment, and that transcriptomic analysis will define the associated molecular mechanism(s), resulting in the ability to optimize strain selection.","[{""submissionId"":20140013481,""id"":""15a0535be00548e898a9e6b7d8ab0cc6"",""publicationDate"":""2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140013481,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""6c34f0966fea42a39ce6a9efb550a8ee""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140013481,""endDate"":""2015-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""c899ecde6c284da2ac7dca0eecf01cc8"",""id"":""ca6ab5ce753d4c69ac6c37de11f80b50""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""c899ecde6c284da2ac7dca0eecf01cc8"",""id"":""3f90b558f8e042c4b9351f63757eab2e""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""c899ecde6c284da2ac7dca0eecf01cc8"",""startDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140013481

Carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by astronauts inside space suits can accumulate to levels that may affect health and performance. The human health and performance risks associated with different levels of CO2 exposure in the flight environment remain an area of debate.  The purpose of this study is to characterize the limit of acceptable performance (cognitive and physical) decrements and symptom severity for mission operations when subjected to elevated inspired CO2 levels in simulated contingency lunar extravehicular activity (EVA) scenarios.

METHODS:
This study will create a simulation of a 1-hour, ~2km contingency EVA walk back to a habitat, incorporating a passive treadmill and a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) simulation of a lunar EVA environment.  Subjects will be asked to walk on a treadmill while breathing partial pressures of CO2 of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30mmHg for 1 hour at a time. Cognitive performance will be quantified using validated cognitive tests and measures of functional task performance embedded within the VR environment.  Test subject symptoms and self-assessment of performance will be evaluated via survey.

The Agency is shifting from an exploration-based program with human activities in low Earth orbit (LEO) and targeted robotic missions in deep space to a more sustainable and integrated pioneering approach. However, pioneering space involves daunting technical challenges of transportation, maintaining health, and enabling crew productivity for long durations in remote, hostile, and alien environments. Subject matter experts from NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) are currently studying a human exploration campaign that involves deployment of assets for planetary exploration. This study, called the Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC) study, explores options with solar electric propulsion as a central component of the transportation architecture. This particular in-space transportation option often results in long duration transit to destinations. The EMC study is also investigating deployed human rated systems like landers, habitats, rovers, power systems and ISRU system to the surface of Mars, which also will involve long dormant periods when these systems are staged on the surface. In order to enable the EMC architecture, campaign and element design leads along with system and capability development experts from HEOMD's System Maturation Team (SMT) have identified additional capabilities, systems and operation modes that will sustain these systems especially during these dormant phases of the mission. Dormancy is defined by the absence of crew and relative inactivity of the systems. For EMC missions, dormant periods could range from several months to several years. Two aspects of uncrewed dormant operations are considered herein: (1) the vehicle systems that are placed in a dormant state and (2) the autonomous vehicle systems and robotic capabilities that monitor, maintain, and repair the vehicle and systems. This paper describes the mission stages of dormancy operations, phases of dormant operations, and critical system capabilities that are needed for dormant operations. This paper will compare dormancy operations of past robotic missions to identify lessons that can be applied to planned human exploration missions. Finally, this paper will also identify future work and analysis planned to assess system performance metrics and integrated system operations.","[{""submissionId"":20160012027,""id"":""27979f9f9470424bae83dd1a626dea64"",""publicationDate"":""2016-09-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160012027,""name"":""International Astronautical Federation"",""location"":""Paris, France"",""id"":""4f3e705f36304384b4704f9a4da11d1d""},{""country"":""Mexico"",""submissionId"":20160012027,""endDate"":""2016-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Astronautical Federation"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""ae53888bbe414bd0a47a91c1d62b7fab"",""id"":""27d59881f63540e0a28f6c311c09703d""}],""name"":""International Astronautical Congress"",""location"":""Guadalajara"",""id"":""ae53888bbe414bd0a47a91c1d62b7fab"",""startDate"":""2016-09-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 892235.01.01.04""]",undefined,"[""Systems Analysis And Operations Research""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160012027

20040089010,REPRINT,Insight into mechanisms of reduced orthostatic performance after exposure to microgravity: comparison of ground-based and space flight data,"[""Convertino, V. A.""]","Since the beginning of human spaceflight, the value of understanding mechanisms of physiological adaptation to microgravity became apparent to life scientists who were interested in maintining crew health and developing countermeasures agains adverse effects of the mission. However, several characteristics associated the the logistics of spaceflight presented significant limitations to the scientific study of human adaptation to microgravity. Because space missions are so infrequent and involve minimal numbers of crewmembers, meaninful statistical analysis of data are limited. Reproducibility of results from spaceflight experiments is difficult to assess since there are few repeated space missions involving the same crewmembers. Since the emphasis of space missions is placed on operations, experiments are compromised without adequate control over various factors (e.g., time, diet, physical activities, etc.) that can impact measured responses. With the mimimal opportunity to collect spaceflight data, there is a high risk of experiments that simultaneously interfere with other experiments by the increasing demand on the crewmembers to participate in mumerous experiments proposed by multiple investigators. The technology and ability to measure physiological functions necessary to test specific hypotheses can be severely limited by physical space and power constraints of the space enviroment. Finally, technical and logistical aspects of space missions such as launch delays, extended missions, and inflight operational emergencies can significantly compromise the timing and control of experiments. These limitations have stimulated scientists to develop ground-based analogs of microgravity in an effort to investigate the effects of spaceflight on physiological function in a controlled experimental setting. The purpose of this paper is to provide a selected comparison of data collected from ground-based experiments with those obtained from spaceflight in an effort to assess the adequacy of ground analogs of actual flight for the study of human physiological adaptation to microgravity. Specifically, results from ground and spaceflight will be used to provide insight into mechanisms underlying adaptations of blood pressure regulation and reduced orthostatic performance to the microgravity environment.","[{""volume"":""5"",""submissionId"":20040089010,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""1077-9248"",""id"":""6e20be56ff844ea3a56cca0bc9698d64"",""publicationName"":""Journal of gravitational physiology :  a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1998-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089010
20210022482,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Spaceflight Medical Evacuation Risk Assessment Principles - A Qualitative Investigation,"[""A T Almand"",""A L Anderson"",""Ryan Keller"",""Jonathan Laws"",""K R Lehnhardt"",""B D Easter""]","BACKGROUND
Future human space exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) will require innovative solutions in many areas, primarily those that provide direct medical support to crew on long-duration missions and optimize their health and performance. The associated challenges therein will be numerous, including but not necessarily limited to extended one-way or ""asynchronous"" communication delays, minimal to non-existent resupply, and a prolonged transit time to ""definitive care"" ranging from 3-days to 9-months. At the same time, long-duration exploration spacecraft and crew will face restrictions on mass, power, volume, and data far more significant than that seen in current LEO settings. Given these limitations, medical risk assessment is of primary importance, especially evaluating the implications of a medical evacuation of an ill or injured crewmember. Such evacuations are complicated, potentially dangerous, and well may be impossible in certain phases of the mission. Regardless, such issues must be weighed against the risks of the injured crew remaining aboard a spacecraft with limited medical resources. 
OBJECTIVE
This qualitative study drew from the experiences of subject matter experts (SMEs) in spaceflight and appropriate analog environments (i.e., military, disaster, and extreme environment fields) to identify unique principles common amongst medical evacuation considerations helpful in informing future risk assessment tools. Appropriate analog environments included austere operational settings where multiple factors (weather, logistics/limited resupply, denied/extreme environments, and patient condition) resulted in a limited ability to provide definitive local medical care. The fundamental principles in question revolved around scenarios where evacuation became a complicating yet necessary consideration and where life-threatening medical concerns had to be weighed against critical mission objective(s). 
The primary authors collected semi-structured data gathered through in-depth interviews with 16 subject matter experts (SMEs). Interview questions investigated how these SMEs consider and weigh the attendant risks present in medical evacuation scenarios. Among the critical questions posed were those that sought to understand how the SME balanced the challenges and requirements of medical evacuation (or keeping an injured patient ""on-site"" aka: ""prolonged field care"") against the evacuation operation's risks on impacting overarching mission success. 
The team analyzed interview transcripts for common themes and principles using the qualitative methods of thematic analysis based on consensus, co-occurrence, and comparison. As a result, nine primary risk consideration themes and nine contributing factor themes emerged, all of which will ideally inform future medical evacuation decision-making tools and operational decision-making for exploration class missions. 
Specific aims for this study included:
1. 	Identification of common principles used to assess risks and benefits of medical evacuations in extreme environments
2. 	Identification of common points of friction or complication and challenges in extreme environment evacuations

20070009988,EXTENDED_ABSTRACT,Bisphosphonate Treatment: Risk Management in Long Duration Spaceflight,"[""Fogarty, Jennifer A."",""Aunon, Serena M.""]","Bisphosphonates are a class of pharmaceuticals used to treat diverse bone disorders such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and multiple myeloma. They constitute a class of drugs which adhere to bony surfaces and interfere with the resorptive activity of osteoclasts. They also represent a potential countermeasure towards the loss of bone mass experienced by astronauts during spaceflight. Recently, the medical literature has revealed cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw in individuals receiving intravenous bisphosphonate therapy with a smaller number of cases occurring in individuals receiving the oral form of the medication. Risk management for long duration missions requires consideration of mission success and lifetime health care of astronauts. We performed MEDLINE and PubMed searches (1966 December 2006) using the following keywords: osteonecrosis, jaw, bisphosphonates. Additional references were obtained from the citations of the retrieved articles. Injectable bisphosphonates such as pamidronate and zoledronic acid have been highlighted recently in the literature due to a possible link with osteonecrosis of the jaw. The mechanism of action remains unclear but may be linked to physiologic microdamage in the jawbones resulting from suppression of bone metabolism. The most predisposing factors appear to be the type and dose of bisphosphonate used, a history of dental surgery, trauma, and/or dental infection. In addition, patients diagnosed with a malignancy such as breast cancer or multiple myeloma, who have been on intravenous bisphosphonate therapy for several months seem to be at increased risk. The use of oral bisphosphonates appears to place patients more at risk from acute events such as gastrointestinal tract injury or perforation. Although some studies report little to no increase in GI events compared to placebo, we must remember that in microgravity, astronauts may be unable to comply with medication instructions. They may have difficulty remaining upright for the required 30-45 minutes post-ingestion. We are currently unaware if this inability to comply with instructions on the package insert may lead to an increased risk for GI events. There is a potential long-term complication that resides with both forms of bisphosphonate therapy. In order to repair normally occurring physiologic microdamage to bone, both osteoclastic resorption and osteoblastic bone deposition must be functional. Controversy exists in the literature regarding whether prolonged use of bisphosphonates may lead to the suppression of bone turnover and accumulation of microdamage. Bisphosphonates are a powerful class of drugs that suppress bone turnover, but may cause serious adverse clinical events such as gastrointestinal tract injury or osteonecrosis of the jaw. Unfortunately, little to no data exists currently which may help us provide answers regarding the risks of their use in a healthy astronaut cohort. While controversy exists in the literature regarding their mechanism and long-term consequences, the potential mission impact or lifetime health care impact of an adverse clinical event resulting from bisphosphonate therapy must be considered.","[{""submissionId"":20070009988,""id"":""b1b7d72631784c1dbe0687171d72ec9f"",""publicationDate"":""2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""China"",""submissionId"":20070009988,""endDate"":""2007-05-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics: Human in Space Symposium"",""location"":""Beijing"",""id"":""20ec4882e8704fc0a0de992cba5af4f3"",""startDate"":""2007-05-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070009988
20140005768,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Expanding the Description of Spaceflight Effects beyond Bone Mineral Density [BMD]: Trabecular Bone Score [TBS] in ISS Astronauts,"[""Sibonga, J. D."",""Spector, E. R."",""King, L. J."",""Evans, H. J."",""Smith, S. A.""]","Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA] is the widely-applied bone densitometry method used to diagnose osteoporosis in a terrestrial population known to be at risk for age-related bone loss. This medical test, which measures areal bone mineral density [aBMD] of clinically-relevant skeletal sites (e.g., hip and spine), helps the clinician to identify which persons, among postmenopausal women and men older than 50 years, are at high risk for low trauma or fragility fractures and might require an intervention. The most recognized osteoporotic fragility fracture is the vertebral compression fracture which can lead to kyphosis or hunched backs typically seen in the elderly. DXA measurement of BMD however is recognized to be insufficient as a sole index for assessing fracture risk. DXA's limitation may be related to its inability to monitor changes in structural parameters, such as trabecular vs. cortical bone volumes, bone geometry or trabecular microarchitecture. Hence, in order to understand risks to human health and performance due to space exposure, NASA needs to expand its measurements of bone to include other contributors to skeletal integrity. To this aim, the Bone and Mineral Lab conducted a pilot study for a novel measurement of bone microarchitecture that can be obtained by retrospective analysis of DXA scans. Trabecular Bone Score (TBS) assesses changes to trabecular microarchitecture by measuring the grey color ""texture"" information extracted from DXA images of the lumbar spine. An analysis of TBS in 51 ISS astronauts was conducted to assess if TBS could detect 1) an effect of spaceflight and 2) a response to countermeasures independent of DXA BMD. In addition, changes in trunk body lean tissue mass and in trunk body fat tissue mass were also evaluated to explore an association between body composition, as impacted by ARED exercise, and bone microarchitecture. The pilot analysis of 51 astronaut scans of the lumbar spine suggests that, following an ISS mission, DXA BMD and TBS are detecting different effects of ARED exercise and of ARED + Bisphosphonate on the lumbar spine of astronauts. There is emerging evidence associating reduced TBS with terrestrial metabolic bone disorders where a TBS <1.200 is associated with ""degraded"" while > 1.350 is associated with ""normal."" However, it is not possible to conclude how the spaceflight-induced changes in TBS increase risk for vertebral fractures in the astronaut or if changes in body composition of the trunk region could be an indirect method of assessing exercise effect on bone microarchitecture. More importantly, this pilot analysis demonstrates a new, minimal risk approach for monitoring changes to vertebral bone microarchitecture. This method could help assess the combined skeletal effects of spaceflight with the effects of aging in the astronaut after return to Earth.","[{""submissionId"":20140005768,""id"":""bcf0d9758f9e496899b33fb9e05a7ac0"",""publicationDate"":""2014-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140005768,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""baab22ba601944f59290604671fd1d75""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140005768,""endDate"":""2014-02-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""e0ba972dfcc44c92b51e5a9ce5ea8fa8"",""id"":""baf888d312244d859157e636b6e3c5d8""},{""organizationId"":""8ccaff322ecb48d2811364bf91d9f59d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""e0ba972dfcc44c92b51e5a9ce5ea8fa8"",""id"":""4d0b8206c054460c9c4fdda515c08723""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""e0ba972dfcc44c92b51e5a9ce5ea8fa8"",""id"":""0a790d1abbf2484ebd9cd111fd94c84f""}],""name"":""2014 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP 2014)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""e0ba972dfcc44c92b51e5a9ce5ea8fa8"",""startDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140005768
20205010685,PRESENTATION,Neuroimmune Responses to Space Radiation ,"[""Egle Cekanaviciute""]","One of the main health risks in human deep space exploration is central nervous system (CNS) damage by ionizing radiation due to exposure to galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). In animal models, irradiation with simulated GCRs or their components has been shown to cause neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation associated with cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. The extent of CNS damage is partially mediated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which regulates the interaction between CNS and systemic responses to stressors in the rest of the body. The main cellular regulators of BBB permeability are astrocytes, which also modulate neuronal death, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. However, studies on BBB and astrocyte functions in regulating CNS responses to ionizing radiation have been limited, especially in human tissue/organ analogs. Therefore, we developed a high-throughput 3D organ-on-a-chip system to study human CNS and BBB impairments caused by deep space radiation. We investigated both immediate and delayed CNS responses to major GCR components: 600MeV/n 56Fe ions. We observed ionizing radiation-mediated dose-dependent increases in BBB permeability that was exacerbated by astrocyte presence and accompanied by altered cytokine expression including interleukin-1 receptor alpha downregulation, and increased oxidative stress. In particular, 600MeV/n 56Fe particle irradiation selectively  increased damage and blood-brain barrier permeability only in models that contained astrocytes in addition to endothelial cells, indicating astrocytes as a particularly radiosensitive component of the CNS that could therefore be a suitable a target for neuroprotection. Future studies will compare human and mouse CNS model responses to simulated GCRs and evaluate the induction of an anti-inflammatory phenotype in astrocytes as a potential countermeasure. Furthermore, in our lab we have been exploring the individual variability, genomic associations and secreted biomarkers of responses to space radiation, which could eventually be combined to address personalized CNS health risk and develop individual countermeasures. Ultimately, we aim to expand upon these results to uncover novel cellular and mechanistic targets for countermeasure development to mitigate human CNS damage in deep space exploration.

20140013495,ABSTRACT,HRP's Healthcare Spin-Offs Through Computational Modeling and Simulation Practice Methodologies,"[""Mulugeta, Lealem"",""Walton, Marlei"",""Nelson, Emily"",""Peng, Grace"",""Morrison, Tina"",""Erdemir, Ahmet"",""Myers, Jerry""]","Spaceflight missions expose astronauts to novel operational and environmental conditions that pose health risks that are currently not well understood, and perhaps unanticipated. Furthermore, given the limited number of humans that have flown in long duration missions and beyond low Earth-orbit, the amount of research and clinical data necessary to predict and mitigate these health and performance risks are limited. Consequently, NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) conducts research and develops advanced methods and tools to predict, assess, and mitigate potential hazards to the health of astronauts. In this light, NASA has explored the possibility of leveraging computational modeling since the 1970s as a means to elucidate the physiologic risks of spaceflight and develop countermeasures. Since that time, substantial progress has been realized in this arena through a number of HRP funded activates such as the Digital Astronaut Project (DAP) and the Integrated Medical Model (IMM). Much of this success can be attributed to HRP's endeavor to establish rigorous verification, validation, and credibility (VV&C) processes that ensure computational models and simulations (M&S) are sufficiently credible to address issues within their intended scope. This presentation summarizes HRP's activities in credibility of modeling and simulation, in particular through its outreach to the community of modeling and simulation practitioners. METHODS: The HRP requires all M&S that can have moderate to high impact on crew health or mission success must be vetted in accordance to NASA Standard for Models and Simulations, NASA-STD-7009 (7009) [5]. As this standard mostly focuses on engineering systems, the IMM and DAP have invested substantial efforts to adapt the processes established in this standard for their application to biological M&S, which is more prevalent in human health and performance (HHP) and space biomedical research and operations [6,7]. These methods have also generated substantial interest by the broader medical community though institutions like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to develop similar standards and guidelines applicable to the larger medical operations and research community. DISCUSSION: Similar to NASA, many leading government agencies, health institutions and medical product developers around the world are recognizing the potential of computational M&S to support clinical research and decision making. In this light, substantial investments are being made in computational medicine and notable discoveries are being realized [8]. However, there is a lack of broadly applicable practice guidance for the development and implementation of M&S in clinical care and research in a manner that instills confidence among medical practitioners and biological researchers [9,10]. In this presentation, we will give an overview on how HRP is working with the NIH's Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group (IMAG), the FDA and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) to leverage NASA's biomedical VV&C processes to establish a new regulatory standard for Verification and Validation in Computational Modeling of Medical Devices, and Guidelines for Credible Practice of Computational Modeling and Simulation in Healthcare.","[{""submissionId"":20140013495,""id"":""630c4600933b42fdaeadefdcf3d3b51d"",""publicationDate"":""2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140013495,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""9e74c744f0c7401a961ea2ec3aac7aed""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140013495,""endDate"":""2015-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6b1f38b923384755af58a925fc15df1e"",""id"":""c443eb4df00e49cc9a2519eb2b19e532""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6b1f38b923384755af58a925fc15df1e"",""id"":""61cadb7189a04da6961f62b9009c22c6""}],""name"":""NASA''s Human Research Program Investgator''s Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""6b1f38b923384755af58a925fc15df1e"",""startDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140013495

Advances in biotechnology capabilities offer considerable potential to provide novel insight into those responses as well as innovative diagnostic, treatment, and countermeasure solutions for astronauts as NASA begins to travel beyond low Earth orbit. Omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.) is one example that can provide NASA with critical knowledge of how a crewmember’s genetics, environment, and lifestyle can be used to develop individualized approaches for disease prevention, advance diagnostics, and improve treatment strategies.

NASA ventured into the field of omics on human subjects with the successful completion of the NASA Twins Study which was the first step in mapping the multi-omic profile of astronauts to understand and mitigate the health consequences of spaceflight. The Human Research Program aims to build upon the success of the Twins Study with the NASA Omics Archive flight study, establishing a longitudinal biospecimen archive and efficiently generating a comprehensive high-quality multi-omic dataset from astronauts for the purpose of studying molecular, metabolic, and microbial changes associated with longduration spaceflight missions. The goal is to facilitate scientific and medical research community efforts to characterize and mitigate spaceflight health and performance risks.

In this presentation, we will review details regarding the biospecimen and data archive to be generated by the NASA Omics Archive flight study. Data generated as part of this project will be archived in the NASA Life Sciences Portal (NLSP) and be made available for future hypothesis-driven research efforts or occupational surveillance through Institutional Review Board-approved data sharing and retrospective data requests submitted to the Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA) team. We will also present results of a ground study performed to evaluate in-house procedures, new sample collection hardware, and vendor capabilities.

The data repository generated and the samples to be archived by this study will enable future research efforts to assess an astronauts’ unique molecular and genetic profile with respect to individual spaceflight responses. Results of which will be instrumental in enabling precision health capabilities to better assess and mitigate spaceflight risks, detect disease states earlier, and actively monitor countermeasure treatments, ultimately improving clinical outcomes during future exploration class missions.

These cells are contributing to normal tissue regenerative health and defence against disease. In Human space exploration context, it is extremely important to determine spaceflight provoked changes in tissue's regenerational capabilities. Microgravity experienced during spaceflight causes unloading and mechanical disuse on all orthostatic support tissues, therefore impacting stem cell fate and lineage commitment decisions. Investigating how ESCs respond to mechanical stimulation is a platform for fundamental developmental and regeneration research applicable for spaceflight. However, the gene expression programs associatiated with early committment stem cell pathways in response to physical stimulation are not readily known. Single-cell RNA-seq technologies have recently revolutionized the world of molecular biology by providing the capability to assess gene expression pattern within a single cell. Our method isolates and separately barcodes mRNAs from thousands of single cells and sequences their expressomes.

20240002259,PRESENTATION,NASA HRP Food and Nutrition Risk Strategy,"[""Rebecca L Brocato"",""Michael Brian Stenger"",""Stuart Lee"",""Grace L Douglas""]","The Human Health Countermeasures (HHC) Element of NASA’s Human Research Program (HRP), along with other organizations within NASA, conduct research and capability developments to buy down the risk of performance decrement and crew illness due to inadequate food and nutrition. Food and nutrition are critical for health and performance both in low Earth orbit and on exploration missions. On the International Space Station (ISS), crewmembers share a defined set of pantry foods, and have limited preference and shelf-life foods (e.g. fruits and vegetables) from resupply missions. Exploration design reference missions (DRMs) will likely be more constrained than missions to ISS, where those crewmembers would be subject to a more restricted food system due to resource limitations. HRP food and nutrition research consists of studies to close the following research gaps: determination of the nutritional requirements to maintain health and performance for the defined DRMs, determining the nutrient content, safety, and acceptability of the spaceflight food system specific to DRM and vehicle constraints, development of countermeasures either within or in addition to the food system to mitigate decrements to health and performance by DRM, and the validation and integration of food system countermeasures in analogs and in flight. The current spaceflight food system is shelf-stable, consisting of freeze-dried foods, thermostabilized foods, natural form foods, and powdered beverages. Crops represent a food system countermeasure that has the potential to supplement the pre-packaged food system. As an applied research program, HRP goals for crop research are centered around three main themes: nutrition, safety, and acceptability. As crops advance through Crop Readiness Level evaluations, HHC partners with the sponsoring organization to ensure that HRP goals are met for crops to be consumed in spaceflight.

20150011647,PRESENTATION,Modeling the Effects of Spaceflight on the Posterior Eye in VIIP,"[""Ethier, C. R."",""Feola, A. J."",""Raykin, J."",""Mulugeta, L."",""Gleason, R."",""Myers, J. G."",""Nelson, E. S."",""Samuels, B.""]","Purpose: Visual Impairment and Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome is a new and significant health concern for long-duration space missions. Its etiology is unknown, but is thought to involve elevated intracranial pressure (ICP)that induces connective tissue changes and remodeling in the posterior eye (Alexander et al. 2012). Here we study the acute biomechanical response of the lamina cribrosa (LC) and optic nerve to elevations in ICP utilizing finite element (FE) modeling. Methods: Using the geometry of the posterior eye from previous axisymmetric FE models (Sigal et al. 2004), we added an elongated optic nerve and optic nerve sheath, including the pia and dura. Tissues were modeled as linear elastic solids. Intraocular pressure and central retinal vessel pressures were set at 15 mmHg and 55 mmHg, respectively. ICP varied from 0 mmHg (suitable for standing on earth) to 30 mmHg (representing severe intracranial hypertension, thought to occur in space flight). We focused on strains and deformations in the LC and optic nerve (within 1 mm of the LC) since we hypothesize that they may contribute to vision loss in VIIP. Results: Elevating ICP from 0 to 30 mmHg significantly altered the strain distributions in both the LC and optic nerve (Figure), notably leading to more extreme strain values in both tension and compression. Specifically, the extreme (95th percentile) tensile strains in the LC and optic nerve increased by 2.7- and 3.8-fold, respectively. Similarly, elevation of ICP led to a 2.5- and 3.3-fold increase in extreme (5th percentile) compressive strains in the LC and optic nerve, respectively. Conclusions: The elevated ICP thought to occur during spaceflight leads to large acute changes in the biomechanical environment of the LC and optic nerve, and we hypothesize that such changes can activate mechanosensitive cells and invoke tissue remodeling. These simulations provide a foundation for more comprehensive studies of microgravity effects on human vision, e.g. to guide biological studies in which cells and tissues are mechanically loaded in a ranger elevant for microgravity conditions.","[{""submissionId"":20150011647,""id"":""68dd56aa627142a6babeac82ab47fa96"",""publicationDate"":""2015-05-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150011647,""name"":""Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology"",""location"":""Rockville, MD, United States"",""id"":""cdc78785a207473bb650edf5b5e8cc20""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150011647,""endDate"":""2015-05-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology"",""location"":""Rockville, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f4cea95732204d2ba5fea6aef01b454a"",""id"":""a661cd50a3c44ca2bbc9b8e564a99857""}],""name"":""The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2015 Annual Meeting"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""f4cea95732204d2ba5fea6aef01b454a"",""startDate"":""2015-05-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 516724.01.02.10"",""NNJ11HE31A"",""NNX13AP91G""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150011647

K."",""Choi, S."",""Gong, C."",""Leveson-Gower, D."",""Ronca, A."",""Taylor, E."",""Beegle, J.""]","Rodent research is a valuable essential tool for advancing biomedical discoveries in life sciences on Earth and in space. The National Research Counsel's Decadal survey (1) emphasized the importance of expanding NASAs life sciences research to perform long duration, rodent experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). To accomplish this objective, new flight hardware, operations, and science capabilities were developed at NASA ARC to support commercial and government-sponsored research. The flight phases of two separate spaceflight missions (Rodent Research-1 and Rodent Research-2) have been completed and new capabilities are in development. The first flight experiments carrying 20 mice were launched on Sept 21, 2014 in an unmanned Dragon Capsule, SpaceX4; Rodent Research-1 was dedicated to achieving both NASA validation and CASIS science objectives, while Rodent Reesearch-2 extended the period on orbit to 60 days. Groundbased control groups (housed in flight hardware or standard cages) were maintained in environmental chambers at Kennedy Space Center. Crewmembers previously trained in animal handling transferred mice from the Transporter into Habitats under simultaneous veterinary supervision by video streaming and were deemed healthy. Health and behavior of all mice on the ISS was monitored by video feed on a daily basis, and post-flight quantitative analyses of behavior were performed. The 10 mice from RR-1 Validation (16wk old, female C57Bl6/J) ambulated freely and actively throughout the Habitat, relying heavily on their forelimbs for locomotion. The first on-orbit dissections of mice were performed successfully, and high quality RNA (RIN values>9) and liver enzyme activities were obtained, validating the quality of sample recovery. Post-flight sample analysis revealed that body weights of FLT animals did not differ from ground controls (GC) housed in the same hardware, or vivarium controls (VIV) housed in standard cages. Organ weights analyzed post-flight showed that there were no differences between FLT and GC groups in adrenal gland and spleen weights, whereas FLT thymus and liver weights exceeded those of GC. Minimal differences between the control groups (GC and VIV) were observed. In addition, Over 3,000 aliquots collected post-flight from the four groups of mice were deposited into the Ames Life Science Data Archives for the Biospecimen Sharing Program and Genelab project. New capabilities recently developed include DEXA scanning, grip strength tests and male mice. In conclusion, new capability for long duration rodent habitation of group-housed rodents was developed and includes in-flight sample collection, thus avoiding the complication of reentry. Results obtained to date reveal the possibility of striking differences between the effects of short duration vs. long duration spaceflight. This Rodent Research system enables achievement of both basic science and translational research objectives to advance human exploration of space.","[{""submissionId"":20160001705,""id"":""8e4694e2e8704f65bcc20579b436323e"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160001705,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""390bcee22d054e6592e2f4b9c8da0c83""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160001705,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""c4e684b1b61e4cf782860d0834624ee4"",""id"":""e0c6a835347d4f6bba84b6e59509d1b4""}],""name"":""2016 Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2016)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""c4e684b1b61e4cf782860d0834624ee4"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Space Sciences (General)"",""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160001705

The professional astronaut population has, by selection, better than average health and physical capacity. The essentials of life on earth are adequately met by the spacecraft. However, as the human body adapts to weightlessness, it is compromised for the usual life on earth, but readaptation is rapid. Long term flight without countermeasures will produce major changes in the cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal and neuromuscular systems. There is strong theoretical and experimental evidence from 1-g studies and limited in-flight evidence to believe that exercise is a key counter-measure to many of these adaptations.","[{""submissionId"":19910001265,""id"":""47162e573d5a4ee59751bfd0b4a44936"",""publicationName"":""Workshop on Exercise Prescription for Long-Duration Space Flight"",""publicationDate"":""1989-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":19910001261,""title"":""Workshop on Exercise Prescription for Long-Duration Space Flight""},{""id"":19910001261,""title"":""Workshop on Exercise Prescription for Long-Duration Space Flight""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19910001265

Globus"",""Candice GT Tahimic""]","Space flight presents unique risks to human health. Microgravity and social isolation are important space flight stressors which have vast impact on multiple systems such as the musculoskeletal, immune and central nervous system (CNS). To explore candidate countermeasures against tissue decrements caused by spaceflight, we performed a pilot study with PLacental-eXpanded stromal (PLX) cells. PLX cells secrete factors that modulate the immune system, but do not trigger host immune responses, enabling treatment in subjects that have intact immune systems. These cells had previous success in treating critical limb ischemia and acute radiation syndrome in murine models. In this study, 4-month-old female mice underwent 30 days of hindlimb unloading (HU) in single housing conditions to simulate long-term weightlessness and isolation. HU and normally ambulating controls were administered with PLX cells or sham-injected with Plasmalyte. We hypothesized that administration of PLX cells will mitigate some of the effects caused by prolonged HU. We found that treatment with PLX cells was well tolerated as indicated by body weights, circulating corticosterone levels and immune organ response to injection of the cells. HU led to the expected decreases in soleus muscle weights and bone loss. We did not observe any protective properties of the PLX cells in the musculoskeletal system but found that the cell treatment partially protected from a subset of HU-induced immune and CNS changes. In the hippocampus, protein levels of 9 of 44 cytokines were downregulated by HU. PLX administration mitigated changes in expression of 8 of these cytokines, including IL-2, IL-6 and MCP-1. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the protective effects of PLX-PAD against HU-induced changes in the cytokine milieu of the CNS. Our findings warrant further studies, which includes testing in actual spaceflight.

In 2018, the International Space Station (ISS) [Figure 1] partnership completed a revision for the third edition of the International Space Station Benefits for Humanity, a compilation of case studies of benefits being realized from ISS activities in the areas of human health, Earth observations and disaster response, innovative technology, global education, and economic development of space. The revision included new assessments of economic value and scientific value with more detail than the second edition. The third edition contains updated statistics on the impacts of the benefits as well as new benefits that have developed since the previous publication. This presentation will summarize the updates on behalf of the ISS Program Science Forum, which consists of senior science representatives across the ISS international partnership. An independent consultant determined the economic valuation (EV) of ISS research benefits case studies and the third edition contains the results. The process involved a preliminary assessment of economic, social, and innovation factors. A more detailed assessment followed, which included factors such as addressable market, market penetration, revenue generation, ability to leverage across other applications or customer groups, quality of life improvements, health benefits, environmental benefits, cultural and community cohesion, inspiration, new knowledge, novel approaches, creation of a unique market niche, and research leadership. Because of the unique microgravity environment of the ISS laboratory, the multidisciplinary and international nature of the research, and the significance of the investment in its development, analyzing ISS scientific impacts is an exceptional challenge. As a result, the ISS partnership determined the scientific valuation (SV) of ISS research using a combination of citation analyses, bibliometrics, and narratives of important ISS utilization results. Approximately 2,100 ISS results publications comprised of scientific journal articles, conference proceedings, and gray literature, representing over 5,000 authors and co-authors on Earth were used in this evaluation to enable the communication of impacts of ISS research on various science and technology fields across many countries. The publication also updates and expands the previously described benefits of research results in the areas of space commerce, technology development, human health, environmental change and disaster response, and education activities. Distinct benefits return to Earth from the only orbiting multidisciplinary laboratory of its kind. The ISS is a stepping-stone for future space exploration while also providing findings that develop low Earth orbit as a place for sustained human activity and improve life on our planet.","[{""submissionId"":20190001397,""id"":""4201c486c3644fda98f424ed92d830a1"",""publicationDate"":""2018-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190001397,""name"":""International Astronautical Federation"",""location"":""Paris, France"",""id"":""9caf99df52da469584cb3dd08b4c74f5""},{""country"":""Germany"",""submissionId"":20190001397,""endDate"":""2018-10-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Astronautical Federation"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""af8788db82ea486192dd05b7189a6401"",""id"":""726755eb38dd45c9b862376fb8418bf8""}],""name"":""International Astronautical Congress (IAC)"",""location"":""Bremen"",""id"":""af8788db82ea486192dd05b7189a6401"",""startDate"":""2018-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190001397

K."",""Baldini, F."",""Huff, D.""]","Future spaceflight will require travelers to spend ever-increasing periods of time in microgravity. Optimal functioning of the immune system is of paramount importance for the health and performance of these travelers. A meta-analysis statistical procedure was used to analyze immune system data from crew members in United States and Soviet space missions from 8.5 to 140 days duration between 1968 and 1985. Ten immunological parameters (immunoglobulins A, G, M, D, white blood cell (WBC) count, number of lymphocytes, percent total lymphocytes, percent B lymphocytes, percent T lymphocytes, and lymphocyte reactivity to mitogen) were investigated using multifactorial, repeated measure analysis of variance. With the preflight level set at 100, WBC count increased to 154 +/- 14% (mean +/- SE; p less than or equal to 0.05) immediately after flight; there was a decrease in lymphocyte count (83 +/- 4%; p less than or equal to 0.05) and percent of total lymphocytes (69 +/- 1%; p less than or equal to 0.05) immediately after flight, with reduction in RNA synthesis to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) to 51 +/- 21% (p less than or equal to 0.05) and DNA synthesis to PHA to 61 +/- 8% (p less than or equal to 0.05) at the first postflight measurement. Thus, some cellular immunological functions are decreased significantly following spaceflight. More data are needed on astronauts' age, aerobic power output, and parameters of their exercise training program to determine if these immune system responses are due solely to microgravity exposure or perhaps to some other aspect of spaceflight.","[{""volume"":""5"",""submissionId"":19970016033,""publisher"":""Harwood Academic Publishers G.m.b.H."",""id"":""2e8df26ef8ce4874b054033d518cdffc"",""publicationName"":""Sports Medicine, Training, and Rehabilitation"",""publicationDate"":""1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""RTOP 199-18-12-07""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19970016033

With the current Soyuz training flow, physician support is required for nominal training evolutions involving pressure changes or other potential physical risks detailed in this presentation. In addition, full-time physician presence in Star City helps to address the disparity in access to health care in these relatively remote practice areas, while also developing and maintaining relationships with host nation resources. A unique part of standard training in Russia also involves survival training in both winter and water environments; logistic details and medical impacts of each of these training scenarios will be discussed. Following support of a successful training flow, UTMB/KBRwyle's Star City Medical Support Group (SCMSG) is also responsible for configuring medical packs in support of Soyuz launches and landings; we will present the rationale for current pack contents within the context of specific operational needs. With respect to contingency events, the group will describe their preparedness to respond appropriately by activating both local and global resources as necessary, detailing a specialized subset of the group who continually work and update these assets, given changes in international infrastructure and other impacts.","[{""submissionId"":20160012740,""id"":""dc8546db24104cbebeaaf6515c662b61"",""publicationDate"":""2017-04-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160012740,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States"",""id"":""13db4da0a0704a278ee560cdfe02b146""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160012740,""endDate"":""2017-05-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b69d4cc1d65b4305b04ea06c7104bd66"",""id"":""782412f55a2448c38737d76284f6f967""}],""name"":""AsMA Annual Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""Denvor, CO"",""id"":""b69d4cc1d65b4305b04ea06c7104bd66"",""startDate"":""2017-04-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160012740
20080046171,ABSTRACT,Use of Potassium Citrate to Reduce the Risk of Renal Stone Formation During Spaceflight,"[""Whitson, P. A."",""Pietrzyk, R. A."",""Sams, C. F."",""Jones, J. A."",""Nelman-Gonzalez, M."",""Hudson, E. K.""]","Introduction: NASA s Vision for Space Exploration centers on exploration class missions including the goals of returning to the moon and landing on Mars. One of NASA s objectives is to focus research on astronaut health and the development of countermeasures that will protect crewmembers during long duration voyages. Exposure to microgravity affects human physiology and results in changes in the urinary chemical composition favoring urinary supersaturation and an increased risk of stone formation. Nephrolithiasis is a multifactorial disease and development of a renal stone is significantly influenced by both dietary and environmental factors. Previous results from long duration Mir and short duration Shuttle missions have shown decreased urine volume, pH, and citrate levels and increased calcium. Citrate, an important inhibitor of calcium-containing stones, binds with urinary calcium reducing the amount of calcium available to form stones. Citrate inhibits renal stone recurrence by preventing crystal growth, aggregation, and nucleation and is one of the most common therapeutic agents used to prevent stone formation. Methods: Thirty long duration crewmembers (29 male, 1 female) participated in this study. 24-hour urines were collected and dietary monitoring was performed pre, in, and postflight. Crewmembers in the treatment group received two potassium citrate (KCIT) pills, 10 mEq/pill, ingested daily beginning 3 days before launch, all inflight days and through 14 days postflight. Urinary biochemical and dietary analyses were completed. Results: KCIT treated subjects exhibited decreased urinary calcium excretion and maintained the levels of calcium oxalate supersaturation risk at their preflight levels. The increased urinary pH levels in these subjects reduced the risk of uric acid stones. Discussion: The current study investigated the use of potassium citrate as a countermeasure to minimize the risk of stone formation during ISS missions. Results suggest that supplementation with potassium citrate decreases the risk of stone formation during and immediately after spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":20080046171,""id"":""7d42d78226d84a44a2841c8884ddaa77"",""publicationDate"":""2008-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20080046171,""endDate"":""2009-05-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""80th Annual Meeting of the Aerospace Medical Medical Association"",""location"":""Los Angeles, CA"",""id"":""de1b8cc862544455866da1bd9fa37fcb"",""startDate"":""2009-05-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080046171

The human health and performance risks associated with different levels of CO2 exposure in the flight environment remain an area of debate.  The purpose of this study is to characterize the limit of acceptable performance (cognitive and physical) decrements and symptom severity for mission operations when subjected to elevated inspired CO2 levels in the spacesuit during contingency EVA scenarios.

Methods: This study will create a simulation of a 1-hour contingency EVA walk back to the habitat, incorporating a passive treadmill and a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) simulation of a lunar EVA.  Subjects will be asked to walk on a treadmill while breathing partial pressures of CO2 of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30mmHg for 1 hour at a time. Cognitive performance will be quantified using validated cognitive tests and measures of functional task performance embedded within the VR environment.  Test subject symptoms and self-assessment of performance will be evaluated via survey. 

Results: This study currently has approval from NASA’s Institutional Review Board and has completed the Test Readiness Review process.  Next steps for this research study include test subject recruitment, data collection, and analysis.  Data collection is planned for calendar year 2022 and 2023.

Discussion: This study will provide valuable information regarding how various partial pressures of CO2 exposure impact acute health, as well as cognitive and physical performance during simulated lunar EVA.  This information will be vital in the assessment of overall risk associated with current hardware (vehicle and suit) design for upcoming exploration missions.  It will also be invaluable for informing future standards and requirements.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220015630,""endDate"":""2023-02-09T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""750afa28f5d449e882be87fc981f4974"",""id"":""9f3ea16231f94e24b63c66de2941596b""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS 2023)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""750afa28f5d449e882be87fc981f4974"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/08d8f955-514e-4e10-b860-bd009811ec13/summary"",""startDate"":""2023-02-07T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.03.07.A2.1807""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220015630

A.""]","Biospecimen Sharing Programs (BSPs) have been organized by NASA Ames Research Center since the 1960s with the goal of maximizing utilization and scientific return from rare, complex and costly spaceflight experiments. BSPs involve acquiring otherwise unused biological specimens from primary space research experiments for distribution to secondary experiments. Here we describe a collaboration leveraging Ames expertise in biospecimen sharing to magnify the scientific impact of research informing astronaut health funded by the NASA Human Research Program (HRP) Human Health Countermeasures (HHC) Element. The concept expands biospecimen sharing to one-off ground-based studies utilizing analogue space platforms (e.g., Hindlimb Unloading (HLU), Artificial Gravity) for rodent experiments, thereby significantly broadening the range of research opportunities with translational relevance for protecting human health in space and on Earth. In this presentation, we will report on biospecimens currently being acquired from HHC Award Head-Down Tilt as a Model for Intracranial and Intraocular Pressures, and Retinal Changes during Spaceflight, and their availability. The BSP add-on to the project described herein has already yielded for HHC-funded investigators more than 4,700 additional tissues that would otherwise have been discarded as waste, with additional tissues available for analysis. Young (3-mo old) male and female rats and Older (9-mo old) male rats are being exposed to HLU for either 7, 14, 28, or 90 days. Additional groups are exposed to 90 days of unloading followed by either 7, 14, 28 days or 90 days of recovery (normal loading). Comparisons are made with non-suspended controls. Unused tissues are: Skin, Lungs, Thymus, Adrenals, Kidneys, Spleen, Hindlimb Muscles (Soleus, Extensor Digitorum Longus, Tibialis Anterior, Plantaris Gastrocnemius), Fat Pads, Reproductive Organs, and Intestines. Tissues are harvested, weighed, preserved then archived (with metadata) using a sample tracking system (CryoTrack). Preservation techniques include snap-freezing and RNALatersnap-freezing. Specimens were weighed at the time of dissection, and organ mass:body mass ratios analyzed to determine unloading effects across conditions and durations. The results corroborate previously reported effects of short-term exposure to microgravity or unloading exposure on various organs, and provide new insights into adaptation to long-duration unloading relevant to sustained spaceflight exposures on ISS.","[{""submissionId"":20180008607,""id"":""ddb386b0b89c482093a4c0301e2544d1"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20180008607,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""b1714d6098ae4ca58e3ceccfa09c4ed1""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180008607,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""e783903998aa4ed7bb129a218522edea"",""id"":""f70e7b8cf18f4259ba32e8e9409613b8""}],""name"":""2017 Human Research Program Investigatorsý Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""e783903998aa4ed7bb129a218522edea"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C"",""NNX13AD94G"",""NNX15AG98A""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180008607
20220017869,OTHER,Exploration Medical Capability Clinical Decision Support System Architecture Recommendation,"[""David L Pletcher"",""Michael Kelsey Krihak""]","A new era in space exploration has arrived with the goal of establishing a long-term presence on the Moon and using those learning to take the next giant leap: sending the first astronauts to Mars. These ambitious goals will require significant changes in in-flight medical care due to constraints on mass, volume, power, crew time, and medical evacuation capabilities. Furthermore, while crews currently rely on real-time communications with ground-based medical providers, as distance from Earth increases, so do communication delays and disruptions. The crew will need to autonomously detect, diagnose, treat, and prevent medical events. These constraints require development of transformative solutions and new technologies. 

Through participation in the Human Research Program’s (HRP) Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) research, NASA has developed and demonstrated a Medical Data Architecture (MDA), a platform upon which a robust capability of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) can be built. As a result, NASA is now positioned to build an advanced autonomous CDS System (CDSS) which will aid in crew health decision-making. 

The CDSS combines data management aspects of a system that would lead to the autonomy required by NASA-STD-3001, Section 3, Health and Medical Care Standards. The project addresses the ExMC gap Medical-701: We need to increase inflight medical capabilities and identify new capabilities that (a) maximize benefit and/or (b) reduce “costs” on human system/mission/vehicle resources. This architecture recommendation document introduces an integrated data architecture that provides self-sufficient medical care for crews on long-duration spaceflight missions.","[{""submissionId"":20220017869,""id"":""f3792895bd1d47ee9e672909fdbdb50c"",""publicationDate"":""2023-01-17T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""305041.01.01.10"",""10448.AC.ID006EMC.01.02V""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220017869
20100036603,PREPRINT,Microbial Contamination in the Spacecraft,"[""Pierson, Duane L.""]","Spacecraft and space habitats supporting human exploration contain a diverse population of microorganisms. Microorganisms may threaten human habitation in many ways that directly or indirectly impact the health, safety, or performance of astronauts. The ability to produce and maintain spacecraft and space stations with environments suitable for human habitation has been established over 40 years of human spaceflight. An extensive database of environmental microbiological parameters has been provided for short-term (< 20 days) spaceflight by more than 100 missions aboard the Space Shuttle. The NASA Mir Program provided similar data for long-duration missions. Interestingly, the major bacterial and fungal species found in the Space Shuttle are similar to those encountered in the nearly 15-year-old Mir. Lessons learned from both the US and Russian space programs have been incorporated into the habitability plan for the International Space Station. The focus is on preventive measures developed for spacecraft, cargo, and crews. On-orbit regular housekeeping practices complete with visual inspections are essential, along with microbiological monitoring. Risks associated with extended stays on the Moon or a Mars exploration mission will be much greater than previous experiences because of additional unknown variables. The current knowledge base is insufficient for exploration missions, and research is essential to understand the effects of spaceflight on biological functions and population dynamics of microorganisms in spacecraft.","[{""submissionId"":20100036603,""id"":""7e9adb0f0c30426ba15ad534141de35c"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100036603
20150021215,ABSTRACT,Bluetooth Heart Rate Monitors For Spaceflight,"[""Buxton, R. E."",""West, M. R."",""Kalogera, K. L."",""Hanson, A. M.""]","Heart rate monitoring is required for crewmembers during exercise aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and will be for future exploration missions. The cardiovascular system must be sufficiently stressed throughout a mission to maintain the ability to perform nominal and contingency/emergency tasks. High quality heart rate data are required to accurately determine the intensity of exercise performed by the crewmembers and show maintenance of VO2max. The quality of the data collected on ISS is subject to multiple limitations and is insufficient to meet current requirements. PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of commercially available Bluetooth heart rate monitors (BT_HRM) and their ability to provide high quality heart rate data to monitor crew health aboard the ISS and during future exploration missions. METHODS: Nineteen subjects completed 30 data collection sessions of various intensities on the treadmill and/or cycle. Subjects wore several BT_HRM technologies for each testing session. One electrode-based chest strap (CS) was worn, while one or more optical sensors (OS) were worn. Subjects were instrumented with a 12-lead ECG to compare the heart rate data from the Bluetooth sensors. Each BT_HRM data set was time matched to the ECG data and a +/-5bpm threshold was applied to the difference between the 2 data sets. Percent error was calculated based on the number of data points outside the threshold and the total number of data points. RESULTS: The electrode-based chest straps performed better than the optical sensors. The best performing CS was CS1 (1.6% error), followed by CS4 (3.3% error), CS3 (6.4% error), and CS2 (9.2% error). The OS resulted in 10.4% error for OS1 and 14.9% error for OS2. CONCLUSIONS: The highest quality data came from CS1, but unfortunately it has been discontinued by the manufacturer. The optical sensors have not been ruled out for use, but more investigation is needed to determine how to obtain the best quality data. CS2 will be used in an ISS Bluetooth validation study, because it simultaneously transmits magnetic pulse that is integrated with existing exercise hardware on ISS. The simultaneous data streams allow for beat-to-beat comparison between the current ISS standard and CS2. Upon Bluetooth validation aboard ISS, the research team will down select a new BT_HRM for operational use.","[{""submissionId"":20150021215,""id"":""e7ed2d97a5e94e42a6385bcb256ad902"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150021215,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""1bec7411e47c4271802ad221ed84f348"",""id"":""c671b48ba32d4342a5f81280324eb5fd""}],""name"":""2016 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2016)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""1bec7411e47c4271802ad221ed84f348"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150021215
20150008151,OTHER,2014 SRP Integration Transcript,"[""Steinberg, Susan""]","HRP's mission is to reduce the risks to human health and performance during long-duration spaceflight. The HRP Integrated Research Plan (IRP) contains the research plans for the 32 risks that require research to characterize and mitigate. From its inception the ""integrate"" aspect of the IRP has denoted the integrated nature of risks to human health and performance. Even though each risk in the IRP has its own research plan and is tracked separately, the interrelated nature of health and performance requires that they be addressed in an integrative or holistic fashion so that the connectedness of physiological systems within the human body and the integrated response to spaceflight can be addressed. Common characteristics of the spaceflight environment include altered gravity, atmospheres, and light/dark cycles; space radiation; isolation; noise; and periods of high or low workload. Long-term exposure to this unique environment produces a suite of physiological effects such as stress; vision, neurocognitive, and anthropometric changes; circadian misalignment; fluid shifts; cardiovascular deconditioning; immune dysregulation; and altered nutritional requirements. Expanding cross-disciplinary integrative approaches that synthesize concepts or data from two or more disciplines would improve the identification and characterization risk factors, and enable the development of countermeasures relevant to multiple risks. Cross-disciplinary approaches might also help to illuminate problem areas that may arise when a countermeasure adversely impacts risks other than those which it was developed to mitigate, or to identify groupings of physiological changes that are likely to occur that may impact the overall risk posture. In 2014 HRP embarked on a pilot study that combined four SRPs (and 12 HRP risks) - Behavioral Health, Sensorimotor, Cardiovascular, and Bone/Muscle - specifically to discuss cross-disciplinary integration. The points outlined below were suggested to seed the discussion, within the bounding constraint that research plans must be feasible and relevant to the HRP mission. While these were suggested starting points, the overall guiding principle was to allow free discussion from panel members on any aspect of integrated research that they felt was important, Existing cross-disciplinary integration as documented in the IRP (HRR), Existing or needed integration already identified by HRP, but not yet well defined within the IRP, Areas of integration that are missing.

The SRP reviewed the new Evidence Report for the Risk of Impaired Control of Spacecraft/Associated Systems and Decreased Mobility Due to Vestibular/Sensorimotor Alterations Associated with Spaceflight (from here on referred to as the 2015 Sensorimotor Evidence Report), and also received a status review of the Risk. The opening section of the 2015 Sensorimotor Evidence Report provides written descriptions of various incidents that have occurred during space missions. In most of these incidents, the main underlying contributing factors are not easy to identify unambiguously. For example, in section 1.9, a number of falls occurred while astronauts were walking on the moon. It is not clear to the SRP, however, why they fell. It is only possible to extrapolate from likely specific psychophysical or physiological abnormalities, but how these abnormalities were determined, and how they were directly responsible for the falls is unclear to the SRP. Section 2.1.2 on proprioception is very interesting, but the functional significance of the abnormalities detected is not clear. The SRP sees this as a problem throughout the report: a mapping between the component abnormalities identified and the holistic behaviors that are most relevant, for example, controlling the vehicle, and locomotion during egress, is generally lacking. The SRP thinks the cognitive section is too strongly focused on vestibular functioning. The SRP questions the notion that the main cognitive effects are mainly attributable to reversible vestibular changes induced by spaceflight. The SRP thinks that there can also be independent cognitive effects. The Functional Task Test (FTT) protocols and the Field Test are particularly valuable. The conclusion is that the unloading of major postural muscles experienced during spaceflight plays a central role in the alteration of functional task performance and balance control. This conclusion stands in contrast with the statements in other parts of the document that emphasize the role of vestibular changes on these functions. It would help to more fully integrate these two views on the predominant effects of spaceflight. Although the SRP thinks the countermeasures section is interesting, the proposed countermeasures are not well integrated with the abnormalities described in previous sections. The SRP thinks it would help enormously to have explicit links among each abnormality, its 2015 Sensorimotor Risk SRP Evidence Review Final Report 2 overall importance/impact on function, and the appropriate countermeasure that can be implemented to maintain adequate functioning.","[{""submissionId"":20160004943,""id"":""f03973d42c684511b01b6140346269e9"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Behavioral Sciences"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160004943
20210022990,CONFERENCE_PAPER,"Bone Health: An Integrated Approach to Monitoring the Dynamic Net Bone Mineral Balance During 2-, 6- and 12-Month Missions Aboard the ISS","[""G W Gordon"","" S J Romaniello"",""S M Smith"",""S R Zwart"","" A J Letcher"",""A D Anbar""]","Spaceflight-induced  bone loss is   a significant health concern for astronauts which is only  partially mitigated by  established countermeasures such as resistive exercise, vitamin D supplementation, and nutritional support.  These countermeasures have proven adequate for nominal 6-month  missions  aboard the ISS, but individual crewmembers may experience a degree of net bone  loss which  varies significantly.  Estimates of whole-body  bone  mineral  content (BMC) made using  DXA show the mean change in BMC averages only -1 %    during a nominal  6-month  ISS mission. However, the observed range of  interpersonal variation extends from + 1 % to -5 % per mission for  crewmembers using ARED as a primary bone  loss countermeasure [1].  This highlights two  significant outstanding issues: (1) we currently cannot predict which  crewmembers will  experience  greater or lesser extents of net bone loss during space flight; and (2) because of limited information  regarding  the dynamics of net bone  loss during space flight, we cannot currently extrapolate the net  bone  loss rates observed during  6-month  ISS missions to even longer duration missions envisioned  for  the Moon and Mars. The overall goal of the Bone Health project is to improve  our understanding of how  net bone  mineral balance dynamically evolves during 2-12 months of  spaceflight using integrated biochemical and calcium isotopic measurements. This will provide a foundation  for estimating the possible  range of changes in BMC that might be  expected during even longer duration missions. As part of the Integrated 1-Year Mission Project, we aim to  address these issues by (1) determining the time course of net whole-body bone  mineral balance during 2-month, 6-month, and 12-month missions aboard the ISS, (2) examining the interpersonal variation  in net bone  loss/gain to  determine whether  this distribution is skewed with rare individuals  experiencing  above  average rates of net  bone  loss, and (3) exploring possible predictors for individuals  who  will experience above or below average rates of net bone  loss.

William""]","Spaceflight causes adaptive changes in cardiovascular function that may deleteriously affect crew health and safety. Over the last three decades, symptoms of cardiovascular changes have ranged from postflight orthostatic tachycardia and decreased exercise capacity to serious cardiac rhythm disturbances during extravehicular activities (EVA). The most documented symptom of cardiovascular dysfunction, postflight orthostatic intolerance, has affected a significant percentage of U.S. Space Shuttle astronauts. Problems of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with spaceflight are a concern to NASA. This has been particularly true during Shuttle flights where the primary concern is the crew's physical health, including the pilot's ability to land the Orbiter, and the crew's ability to quickly egress and move to safety should a dangerous condition arise. The study of astronauts during Shuttle activities is inherently more difficult than most human research. Consequently, sample sizes have been small and results have lacked consistency. Before the Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project (EDOMP), there was a lack of normative data on changes in cardiovascular parameters during and after spaceflight. The EDOMP for the first time allowed studies on a large enough number of subjects to overcome some of these problems. There were three primary goals of the Cardiovascular EDOMP studies. The first was to establish, through descriptive studies, a normative data base of cardiovascular changes attributable to spaceflight. The second goal was to determine mechanisms of cardiovascular changes resulting from spaceflight (particularly orthostatic hypotension and cardiac rhythm disturbances). The third was to evaluate possible countermeasures. The Cardiovascular EDOMP studies involved parallel descriptive, mechanistic, and countermeasure evaluations.","[{""submissionId"":20040201532,""id"":""b09f294fa23d47feb92396a1e2a88309"",""publicationName"":""Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20040201524,""title"":""Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project""},{""id"":20040201524,""title"":""Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040201532
20120016340,ABSTRACT,Shocking Results on the Adverse Effects of CO2 Exposures,"[""James, John T.""]","Carbon dioxide (CO2) is released in large quantities from humans while they live and work in spacecraft or work outside the spacecraft during extravehicular activity (EVA). Removal of this anthropogenic pollutant requires major resources, and these resources increase dramatically as the levels of CO2 set to protect human health and performance are reduced. The current Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentration of CO2 aboard the ISS is 0.7% or 5.3 mmHg; however, according to Chits (mission action requests), NASA and its international partners have agreed to control CO2 levels to less than 4 mmHg. In the meantime, retrospective investigations attempting to associate crew symptoms with elevated CO2 levels over the life if the International Space Station (ISS) are underway to determine if this level is sufficient to protect against health and performance decrements. Anecdotal reports suggest that crewmembers are not able to perform complex tasks as readily in spaceflight as they were able during ground-based training. While physiological effects of CO2 have been studied for many decades, it is only recently that the effects of CO2 on higher reasoning capabilities have been studied. The initial results are shocking. For example, one study published in the respected journal Environmental Health Perspectives showed obvious adverse effects of CO2 exposures on higher reasoning at 1.9 mmHg. The implications and limitations of this study are paramount in determining future CO2 SMACs for human spaceflight, both aboard the ISS and in exploration-class missions.

Rydzak"",""Christian L. Castro"",""Hang N. Nguyen"",""Audry C. Almengor"",""Sarah Stahl-Rommel "",""Satish Mehta"",""Douglas M. Diak"",""Miten Jain "",""Brain E. Crucian "",""Sarah L. Castro-Wallace""]","Reactivation of latent herpesviruses in crews onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is a well-established spaceflight-associated phenomenon and has been linked to overall immune stress. Beyond an indicator of an altered immune state, this stress-induced reactivation of viruses such as herpesvirus simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) may cause clinical symptoms in crew. There is currently no established protocol for in-flight monitoring, and samples are analyzed post-flight using ground-based assays. A real-time, in-flight method for herpesvirus detection followed by stress-mitigation strategies would be a significant advance. 

In this study, we developed a real-time assay for the multiplex detection of HSV-1, EBV, and VZV from saliva that could be implemented for in-situ monitoring of ISS crew. This method builds on previously validated spaceflight-compatible portable molecular protocols and platforms, such as the miniPCR thermal cycler and the MinION sequencer. Since a metagenomic approach is not currently permitted for crew samples (NASA policy), we employed multiplexing-ready primers directed toward targeted regions within the HSV-1, EBV, and VZV genomes. We also used primers for the human gene, Statherin (STATH), as an internal control. These primers were validated using spiked-in, positive control HSV-1, EBV, and VZV from virus-negative saliva extracted using the Zymo-Research Quick-DNA/RNA Viral MagBead Kit. The PCR Barcoding Kit was used to prepare DNA libraries that were then sequenced on the MK1C and analyzed against known reference genomes using minimap2. Following validation of this method with spiked saliva samples, suspected herpesvirus-positive clinical saliva samples were successfully tested. 

Prior to use onboard the ISS, this method will be deployed to an analog environment during overwintering at Palmer Station, Antarctica in 2023. This work represents the successful application of molecular technologies currently onboard the ISS for the real-time monitoring of latent herpesvirus reactivation from saliva samples. This assay, in combination with stress-reduction strategies, holds the potential to manage herpesvirus reactivation in ISS crew, thereby improving health outcomes and overall immunity.

19970005474,CONTRACTOR_REPORT,Spaceflight and Development of Immune Responses,"[""Sonnenfeld, Gerald""]","Evidence from both human and rodent studies has indicated that alterations in immunological parameters occur after space flight. The number of flight experiments has been small, and the full breadth of immunological alterations occurring after space flight remains to be established. Among the major effects on immune responses after space flight that have been reported are: alterations in lymphocyte blastogenesis and natural killer cell activity, alterations in production of cytokines, changes in leukocyte sub-population distribution, and decreases in the ability of bone marrow cells to respond to colony stimulating factors. Changes have been reported in immunological parameters of both humans and rodents. The significance of these alterations in relation to resistance to infection remains to be established. The objective of the studies contained in this project was to determine the effects of space flight on immune responses of pregnant rats and their offspring. The hypothesis was that space flight and the attendant period of microgravity will result in alteration of immunological parameters of both the pregnant rats as well as their offspring carried in utero during the flight. The parameters tested included: production of cytokines, composition of leukocyte sub- populations, response of bone marrow/liver cells to granulocyte/monocyte colony stimulating factor, and leukocyte blastogenesis. Changes in immune responses that could yield alterations in resistance to infection were determined. This yielded useful information for planning studies that could contribute to crew health. Additional information that could eventually prove useful to determine the potential for establishment of a permanent colony in space was obtained.","[{""submissionId"":19970005474,""id"":""e733d28898b048508a110c4acdaa2cc4"",""publicationDate"":""1996-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NCC2-859""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19970005474

The Agency is shifting from an exploration-based program with human activities in low Earth orbit (LEO) and targeted robotic missions in deep space to a more sustainable and integrated pioneering approach. Through pioneering, NASA seeks to address national goals to develop the capacity for people to work, learn, operate, live, and thrive safely beyond Earth for extended periods of time. However, pioneering space involves daunting technical challenges of transportation, maintaining health, and enabling crew productivity for long durations in remote, hostile, and alien environments. Prudent investments in capability and technology developments, based on mission need, are critical for enabling a campaign of human exploration missions. There are a wide variety of capabilities and technologies that could enable these missions, so it is a major challenge for NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) to make knowledgeable portfolio decisions. It is critical for this pioneering initiative that these investment decisions are informed with a prioritization process that is robust and defensible. It is NASA's role to invest in targeted technologies and capabilities that would enable exploration missions even though specific requirements have not been identified. To inform these investments decisions, NASA's HEOMD has supported a variety of analysis activities that prioritize capabilities and technologies. These activities are often based on input from subject matter experts within the NASA community who understand the technical challenges of enabling human exploration missions. This paper will review a variety of processes and methods that NASA has used to prioritize and rank capabilities and technologies applicable to human space exploration. The paper will show the similarities in the various processes and showcase instances were customer specified priorities force modifications to the process. Specifically, this paper will describe the processes that the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) Technology Assessment and Integration Team (TAIT) has used for several years and how those processes have been customized to meet customer needs while staying robust and defensible. This paper will show how HEOMD uses these analyses results to assist with making informed portfolio investment decisions. The paper will also highlight which human exploration capabilities and technologies typically rank high regardless of the specific design reference mission. The paper will conclude by describing future capability and technology ranking activities that will continue o leverage subject matter experts (SME) input while also incorporating more model-based analysis.","[{""submissionId"":20160012013,""id"":""3e5215d918a1492b9c12ae0b60675f60"",""publicationDate"":""2016-09-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160012013,""name"":""International Astronautical Federation"",""location"":""Paris, France"",""id"":""524075014a6a4d84b5830be6ead02071""},{""country"":""Mexico"",""submissionId"":20160012013,""endDate"":""2016-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Astronautical Federation"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""9e0449a756c84d8891f7b7c9c002c5a4"",""id"":""2a59f09abeec40dc8ef4253de79dec29""}],""name"":""International Astronautical Congress"",""location"":""Guadalajara"",""id"":""9e0449a756c84d8891f7b7c9c002c5a4"",""startDate"":""2016-09-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 892235.01.01.04""]",undefined,"[""Systems Analysis And Operations Research""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160012013

The revision included new assessments of economic value and scientific value with more detail than the second edition. The third edition contains updated statistics on the impacts of the benefits as well as new benefits that have developed since the previous publication. This presentation will summarize the updates on behalf of the ISS Program Science Forum, which consists of senior science representatives across the ISS international partnership. An independent consultant determined the economic valuation (EV) of ISS research benefits case studies and the third edition contains the results. The process involved a preliminary assessment of economic, social, and innovation factors. A more detailed assessment followed, which included factors such as addressable market, market penetration, revenue generation, ability to leverage across other applications or customer groups, quality of life improvements, health benefits, environmental benefits, cultural and community cohesion, inspiration, new knowledge, novel approaches, creation of a unique market niche, and research leadership. Because of the unique microgravity environment of the ISS laboratory, the multidisciplinary and international nature of the research, and the significance of the investment in its development, analyzing ISS scientific impacts is an exceptional challenge. As a result, the ISS partnership determined the scientific valuation (SV) of ISS research using a combination of citation analyses, bibliometrics, and narratives of important ISS utilization results. Approximately 2,100 ISS results publications comprised of scientific journal articles, conference proceedings, and gray literature, representing over 5,000 authors and co-authors on Earth were used in this evaluation to enable the communication of impacts of ISS research on various science and technology fields across many countries. The publication also updates and expands the previously described benefits of research results in the areas of space commerce, technology development, human health, environmental change and disaster response, and education activities. Distinct benefits return to Earth from the only orbiting multidisciplinary laboratory of its kind.

20160014528,ABSTRACT,Translational Cellular Research on the International Space Station,"[""Love, John"",""Cooley, Vic""]","The emerging field of Translational Research aims to coalesce interdisciplinary findings from basic science for biomedical applications. To complement spaceflight research using human subjects, translational studies can be designed to address aspects of space-related human health risks and help develop countermeasures to prevent or mitigate them, with therapeutical benefits for analogous conditions experienced on Earth. Translational research with cells and model organisms is being conducted onboard the International Space Station (ISS) in connection with various human systems impacted by spaceflight, such as the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and immune systems. Examples of recent cell-based translational investigations on the ISS include the following. The JAXA investigation Cell Mechanosensing seeks to identify gravity sensors in skeletal muscle cells to develop muscle atrophy countermeasures by analyzing tension fluctuations in the plasma membrane, which changes the expression of key proteins and genes. Earth applications of this study include therapeutic approaches for some forms of muscular dystrophy, which appear to parallel aspects of muscle wasting in space. Spheroids is an ESA investigation examining the system of endothelial cells lining the inner surface of all blood vessels in terms of vessel formation, cellular proliferation, and programmed cell death, because injury to the endothelium has been implicated as underpinning various cardiovascular and musculoskeletal problems arising during spaceflight. Since endothelial cells are involved in the functional integrity of the vascular wall, this research has applications to Earth diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and hypertension. The goal of the T-Cell Activation in Aging NASA investigation is to understand human immune system depression in microgravity by identifying gene expression patterns of candidate molecular regulators, which will provide further insight into factors that may play a critical role in immune function loss during aging. In addition, Omics investigations with cells have synergistic applications ranging from the evaluation of pharmacological countermeasures to drug discovery. Thus, cell-based translational research onboard the ISS is bidirectionally bridging cutting-edge cellular and molecular approaches with space bioastronautics and human health methodologies on Earth.","[{""submissionId"":20160014528,""id"":""f505bdf9439b4e7888626d6fc3a4b66a"",""publicationDate"":""2016-12-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Russia"",""submissionId"":20160014528,""endDate"":""2016-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""3fb4413e9fb94183b854aa10d06439f4"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Institute of Biomedical Problems"",""location"":""Moscow, Russian Federation""}},""meetingId"":""d59b3e2026a54c4ebf3808b2f8482885"",""id"":""ab000840e429421aa147ff99189d4376""}],""name"":""Conference on Space Biology and Medicine"",""location"":""Moscow"",""id"":""d59b3e2026a54c4ebf3808b2f8482885"",""startDate"":""2016-12-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160014528
20170000377,ABSTRACT,Understanding the International Space Station Crew Perspective following Long-Duration Missions through Data Analytics & Visualization of Crew Feedback,"[""Bryant, Cody"",""Meza, David"",""Schoenstein, Nicole"",""Schuh, Susan""]","The International Space Station (ISS) first became a home and research laboratory for NASA and International Partner crewmembers over 16 years ago. Each ISS mission lasts approximately 6 months and consists of three to six crewmembers. After returning to Earth, most crewmembers participate in an extensive series of 30+ debriefs intended to further understand life onboard ISS and allow crews to reflect on their experiences. Examples of debrief data collected include ISS crew feedback about sleep, dining, payload science, scheduling and time planning, health & safety, and maintenance. The Flight Crew Integration (FCI) Operational Habitability (OpsHab) team, based at Johnson Space Center (JSC), is a small group of Human Factors engineers and one stenographer that has worked collaboratively with the NASA Astronaut office and ISS Program to collect, maintain, disseminate and analyze this data. The database provides an exceptional and unique resource for understanding the ""crew perspective"" on long duration space missions. Data is formatted and categorized to allow for ease of search, reporting, and ultimately trending, in order to understand lessons learned, recurring issues and efficiencies gained over time. Recently, the FCI OpsHab team began collaborating with the NASA JSC Knowledge Management team to provide analytical analysis and visualization of these over 75,000 crew comments in order to better ascertain the crew's perspective on long duration spaceflight and gain insight on changes over time. In this initial phase of study, a text mining framework was used to cluster similar comments and develop measures of similarity useful for identifying relevant topics affecting crew health or performance, locating similar comments when a particular issue or item of operational interest is identified, and providing search capabilities to identify information pertinent to future spaceflight systems and processes for things like procedure development and training. In addition, the comments were scored for sentiment using a polarity scoring algorithm to identify both positive and negative comments for particular groups and clusters, allowing the team to make analytically informed decisions regarding future hardware and operating procedures. The use of polarity scoring with time series analysis was used to provide insight into how crew health and habitability is changing throughout various spaceflight increments or the station lifecycle as a whole. Finally, a visualization framework was developed to address the needs of the end users to search for and analyze comments by user, category or mission. This paper will discuss how the use of an analytical framework in conjunction with the current human interface, improved the understanding of crew perspective and shortened the time for analysis allowing for more informed decisions and rapid development of improvements.

20080026194,ABSTRACT,Incorporating Research Findings into Standards and Requirements for Space Medicine,"[""Duncan, J. Michael""]","The Vision for Exploration has been the catalyst for NASA to refocus its life sciences research. In the future, life sciences research funded by NASA will be focused on answering questions that directly impact setting physiological standards and developing effective countermeasures to the undesirable physiological and psychological effects of spaceflight for maintaining the health of the human system. This, in turn, will contribute to the success of exploration class missions. We will show how research will impact setting physiologic standards, such as exposure limits, outcome limits, and accepted performance ranges. We will give examples of how a physiologic standard can eventually be translated into an operational requirement, then a functional requirement, and eventually spaceflight hardware or procedures. This knowledge will be important to the space medicine community as well as to vehicle contractors who, for the first time, must now consider the human system in developing and constructing a vehicle that can achieve the goal of success.","[{""submissionId"":20080026194,""id"":""b9a0e79b68734545aafeb97571656a6c"",""publicationDate"":""2006-05-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20080026194,""endDate"":""2006-05-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association Conference"",""location"":""Orlando, FL"",""id"":""9bd07eb094ee41608046c4cf024e2bd2"",""startDate"":""2006-05-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080026194
20220002632,PRESENTATION,NASA’s Strategic Analysis Cycle 2021 (SAC21) Human Mars Architecture,"[""Michelle Rucker"",""Douglas A Craig"",""Laura M Burke"",""Patrick R Chai"",""Michael B Chappell"",""Bret G Drake"",""Stephen J Edwards"",""Stephen Hoffman"",""Andrew C McCrea"",""Douglas J Trent"",""Patrick A Troutman""]","[Note: this is the presentation for a companion paper with the following abstract]
 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Mars Architecture Team (MAT) was challenged to develop a mission architecture capable of transporting humans to the surface of Mars and back as fast—and as soon—as practical.  This challenge represented a significant departure from previous approaches that minimized Earth-launched mass and maximized in-space transportation efficiency, often resulting in roundtrip missions of three years or more in duration. In the interest of crew health, MAT’s cross-Agency team of subject matter experts was challenged to develop an architecture capable of shortening crew time away from Earth to about two years. MAT was given specific mission constraints, such as number of crew, as well as mandates to minimize surface infrastructure as much as possible and to incorporate nuclear transportation options. The resulting MAT-developed concept, referred to here as the Strategic Analysis Cycle 2021 (SAC21) architecture, leverages Artemis elements and emerging commercial capabilities for cargo and logistics launches, and features a hybrid Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP)/Chemical transportation system able to complete the 1.8 billion kilometer round-trip journey to Mars and back in 760 to 850 days transit time for the 2039 Earth departure opportunity. Three Mars Descent Systems (MDS), each capable of landing about 25 metric tons of useful cargo on the surface of Mars, would be pre-deployed in advance of crew departure from Earth; two of these MDS’s would deliver a partially fueled Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), a fission power system, surface mobility, and additional MAV propellant. To minimize surface infrastructure, only two of the four Mars crew would descend and live in an MDS-landed pressurized rover, exploring the martian surface for 30 martian days, or sols, before returning to Mars orbit aboard their MAV and rejoining the other two crew on the Deep Space Transport for the Earth return voyage. Specifics of many of these architecture elements are detailed in separate technical publications; this paper outlines the end-to-end integrated architecture performance and concept of operations, including synergies with Artemis lunar architecture elements. It is important to note that NASA does not have a formal human Mars program and no decisions have been made; the architecture described here is intended to fill in an often-overlooked corner of the trade space, helping to complete the menu of options available to decision-makers as they chart the course for humans to Mars.

20210023006,PRESENTATION,Enabling Biological Discovery Through Biospecimen Sharing: The Nasa Biological Institutional Scientific Collection,"[""Joseph Varelas"",""Ryan T. Scott"",""Alison J. French"",""Parag Vaishampayan"",""Ahleah Rohr Daniel""]","Understanding biological impacts from spaceflight hazards and the subsequent development of countermeasures are a high priority to enable humanity to venture back to the Moon, and then to Mars and beyond.  Experiments have been conducted with model organisms flown to space and analogous investigations terrestrially, to identify biological mechanistic impacts from spaceflight hazards and to develop mitigation countermeasures, thus contributing towards basic and applied science goals.  However, sending organisms into space is a costly endeavor.  To maximize scientific return, all biospecimens not required by spaceflight-relevant Principal Investigators are harvested, preserved, and archived in the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC).  Biospecimens are collected and preserved according to well-established standard operating procedures to maintain scientific quality and are available on-request by the international scientific community.  NBISC currently stores over 32,000 biospecimens from Shuttle, International Space Station, and ground-based space analog investigations.  Tissue sharing has resulted in at least 33 publications since 2011 and 51 requests since 2016.  Many requests for NBISC biospecimens come from first-time investigators who subsequently submit grants as their point-of-entry into the field of spaceflight biology and health.  The NBISC biorepository is part of the NASA ‘Open Science for Life in Space’ collaborative group of projects, which includes NASA Genelab, the Space Biology Program’s Biospecimen Sharing Program, Physical Sciences Informatics, and the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive.  NBISC biospecimens have been awarded to NASA Genelab, who then generated various open access science ‘omics datasets through the GeneLab Sample Processing laboratory, with resulting data widely used for biological study.  Other NBISC biospecimen awards have led to studies on fecal microbiome analysis, DNA damage analysis using single-cell DNA sequencing, enzymatic-pathway identification involved in spaceflight muscle atrophy, and characterization of ocular morphological changes.  Of note, NBISC is expanded to include a new Space Microbial Culture Collection (SMCC) for the collection, identification, documentation, long-term preservation, and distribution of space-related microbial isolates.

Whiting"",""Alexandra Whitmire""]","Human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit will present unique environmental challenges to astronauts’ operational performance and well-being. Crews will need to work and live in confined and hazardous environments for prolonged missions that involve variable workloads and limitations to privacy, food options, exercise capabilities, leisure outlets, and communication with ground support personnel and loved ones. Currently, behavioral and cognitive risks of spaceflight are mitigated by selecting exceptionally resilient crews and providing extensive individual and team skills training pre-mission, as well as in-mission crew support via a suite of countermeasures targeting sleep and performance optimization, stress management, family support, and team cohesion. However, current countermeasures are difficult or impossible to implement in long-distance exploration as they require real-time communication with Earth and routine resupply. New countermeasure approaches are needed to adapt and enhance the current complement for the new challenges ahead. NASA therefore conducts research at ground-based spaceflight analogs to aid in characterizing the behavioral and cognitive risks of living and working in isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) operational environments. Antarctic research stations are among the few long-duration ICE analogs in existence and are therefore uniquely positioned to support behavioral medicine research to enable human exploration beyond Earth. In this review, we will discuss previous and ongoing efforts to better understand spaceflight behavioral medicine risks, as well as validate new countermeasure approaches for future missions to the moon and Mars.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220008282,""endDate"":""2022-08-10T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""209cf9061c7f58e2b5e76257a84394ce"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research"",""location"":""Cambridge, United Kingdom""}},""meetingId"":""becbc94194ab4d1d90de6472f576ad5e"",""id"":""26f17b0e5fd44ceb99f5c8b36b1683d3""}],""name"":""10th SCAR Open Science Conference"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""becbc94194ab4d1d90de6472f576ad5e"",""url"":""https://scar2022.org"",""startDate"":""2022-08-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""113275.01.04.10""]",undefined,"[""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220008282
20140013190,ABSTRACT,Astronaut Bone Medical Standards Derived from Finite Element (FE) Models of QCT Scans from Population Studies,"[""Sibonga, J. D."",""Feiveson, A. H.""]","This work was accomplished in support of the Finite Element [FE] Strength Task Group, NASA Johnson Space Center [JSC], Houston, TX. This group was charged with the task of developing rules for using finite-element [FE] bone-strength measures to construct operating bands for bone health that are relevant to astronauts following exposure to spaceflight. FE modeling is a computational tool used by engineers to estimate the failure loads of complex structures. Recently, some engineers have used this tool to characterize the failure loads of the hip in population studies that also monitored fracture outcomes. A Directed Research Task was authorized in July, 2012 to investigate FE data from these population studies to derive these proposed standards of bone health as a function of age and gender. The proposed standards make use of an FE-based index that integrates multiple contributors to bone strength, an expanded evaluation that is critical after an astronaut is exposed to spaceflight. The current index of bone health used by NASA is the measurement of areal BMD. There was a concern voiced by a research and clinical advisory panel that the sole use of areal BMD would be insufficient to fully evaluate the effects of spaceflight on the hip. Hence, NASA may not have a full understanding of fracture risk, both during and after a mission, and may be poorly estimating in-flight countermeasure efficacy. The FE Strength Task Group - composed of principal investigators of the aforementioned population studies and of FE modelers -donated some of its population QCT data to estimate of hip bone strength by FE modeling for this specific purpose. Consequently, Human Health Countermeasures [HHC] has compiled a dataset of FE hip strengths, generated by a single FE modeling approach, from human subjects (approx.1060) with ages covering the age range of the astronauts. The dataset has been analyzed to generate a set of FE strength cutoffs for the following scenarios: a) Qualify an applicant for astronaut candidacy, b) Qualify an astronaut for a long-duration (LD) mission, c) Qualify a veteran LD astronaut for a second LD mission, and d) Establish a non-permissible, minimum hip strength following a given mission architecture. This abstract will present the FE-based standards accepted by the FE Strength Task Group for its recommendation to HHC in January 2015.","[{""submissionId"":20140013190,""id"":""dbfcdc4d23554a43b87b829c182fec36"",""publicationDate"":""2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140013190,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""a04c496c630a442e84e33341a0425c13""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140013190,""endDate"":""2015-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""37c344fcc5a94a4eb634457dc464634a"",""id"":""44e8b0f1e04649638b159abb5e80052d""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""37c344fcc5a94a4eb634457dc464634a"",""id"":""5c23d1d9494344228919c8f38d3f5c40""}],""name"":""2015 Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""37c344fcc5a94a4eb634457dc464634a"",""startDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140013190

20210022771,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Improving Efficacy and Safety of Pharmacological Treatment Through Precision Medicine and Pharmacogenomics for Human Deep Space Exploration,"[""Alice R W Tang"",""Emily Stratton"",""Carol Mullenax"",""Jancy Mcphee"",""Corey Theriot""]","INTRODUCTION: Future spaceflight will require increased crew medical autonomy as exploration class missions expanding duration and distance from Earth, especially for Mars missions. As mission duration increases, it will be even more essential to have appropriate amounts of effective medication to ensure the maintenance of crew health and performance. Conversely, mass and volume constraints will become more severe as future spaceflight expands beyond low Earth orbit, where resupply is difficult or becomes impossible. These constraints thus convey an urgency to further tailor medications included in the spacecraft formulary and increased examination of appropriate dosing regimens. BACKGROUND: Precision Health is an exciting area of cutting-edge research and medicine focused on maintaining an individual’s health and performance through in-depth understanding of an individual’s unique factors and molecular profiles. This approach can be adapted to better predict, monitor, and address physiological responses to the spaceflight environment. One example is the field of pharmacogenomics (PGX),the study of how the expressed genome impacts drug responses with the goal of prescribing the right dose of the right drug at the right time. Specifically, PGX testing provides valuable information on an individual’s precise allelic variations to guide physicians in making informed decisions on pharmaceutical choice and dosing to avoid adverse drug events and maximize pharmacological efficacy. The goal of this study was to evaluate which drugs in the current space pharmacy could be evaluated using PGX testing and to understand the potential impact on the health and wellness of the astronaut population. Additionally, we sought to evaluate clinically available FDA-approved PGX testing solutions to better understand its applicability. METHODS: A complete list of drugs onboard the International Space Station (ISS) was analyzed for risk and likelihood of drug failure and PGX actionability. This analysis encompassed both personal astronaut medications, including supplements and over the counter drugs (n=151) and ISS MedKit formulary medications (n=95). Duplicate medications and different formulations were removed, which resulted in 157 total drugs used in the subsequent analysis. A 5x5 risk assessment table was produced by examining the likelihood of drug failure compared to the consequence of drug failure. Likelihood of individual drug failure was defined by whether existing processes are sufficient to prevent adverse events, as ranked from 1 (very low, can easily be prevented) to 5 (very high, cannot be prevented) during a Mars mission. In contrast, the consequence of drug failure was defined by impact to safety, schedule, cost or technical and ranked from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high).A comprehensive assessment of commercially available PGX solutions is currently underway to evaluate specimen requirements, cost/benefit analysis (cost vs. number of alleles assessed), utility of variant analysis, relevance to inflight medication usage, quality of reporting in enabling clinical application, and ease of integration into electronic medical records. RESULTS: Risk assessments(LxC 5x5 table) indicated29medicationswere in the yellow or red zone driven predominantly by drug failure or safety concerns, with the remainder(n=128)of the medications in the green zone where risk is acceptable. We found that current PGX testing results could impact 21% of the total medications in the ISS MedKit and IMAK; of these, 9 medications currently have direct clinically actionable guidance available. Results of the clinical PGX solution evaluations as related to these medications will be presented.
CONCLUSION: PGX testing has demonstrated clear benefits in terrestrial medicine and clinical environments for the selection of proper medications, avoiding adverse drug reactions, and maximizing drug efficacy. We propose that similar benefits would be bestowed on the astronaut and commercial spaceflight passenger population by performing preemptive pre-flight PGX testing to reduce risk of mission failure due to ineffective or toxic medications, improve targeting drug efficacy and safety, and further open the door to countermeasure research exploring PGX-related allelic variants. For example, PGX results could allow tailoring of specific medications at optimal doses more precisely to each individual astronaut, particularly in areas of space motion sickness, sleep aids, and analgesics. An additional benefit is that PGX results could provide information for better planning of the components of a space pharmacy for deep space missions to be more cost effective and more efficient in the utilization of limited pharmaceutical resources. Finally, while PGX testing of the astronaut corps is not currently conducted, this approach could provide immediate impact in support of mission success by reducing risks, optimizing astronaut performance, and providing valuable insights into long-term astronaut health.

20030011385,OTHER,The Effect of Microgravity on the Smallest Space Travelers: Bacterial Physiology and Virulence on Earth and in Microgravity,"[""Pyle, Barry"",""Vasques, Marilyn"",""Aquilina, Rudy""]","Since the first human flights outside of Earth's gravity, crew health and well-being have been major concerns. Exposure to microgravity during spaceflight is known to affect the human immune response, possibly making the crew members more vulnerable to infectious disease. In addition, biological experiments previously flown in space have shown that bacteria grow faster in microgravity than they do on Earth. The ability of certain antibiotics to control bacterial infections may also differ greatly in microgravity. It is therefore critical to understand how spaceflight and microgravity affect bacterial virulence, which is their ability to cause disease. By utilizing spaceflight hardware provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), Dr. Barry Pyle and his team at Montana State University, Bozeman, will be performing an experiment to study the effects of microgravity on the virulence of a common soil and water bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Importantly, these bacteria have been detected in the water supplies of previous Space Shuttle flights. The experiment will examine the effects of microgravity exposure on bacterial growth and on the bacterium's ability to form a toxin called Exotoxin A. Another goal is to evaluate the effects of microgravity on the physiology of the bacteria by analyzing their ability to respire (produce energy), by studying the condition of the plasma membrane surrounding the cell, and by determining if specific enzymes remain active. Proteins produced by the bacteria will also be assayed to see if the normal functions of the bacteria are affected. In the context of human life support in spaceflight, the results of this experiment will offer guidance in providing the highest possible water quality for the Shuttle in order to limit the risk of infection to human occupants and to minimize water system and spacecraft deterioration.","[{""submissionId"":20030011385,""id"":""813099b9e6924d5992f88dcef89bfcf8"",""publicationName"":""STS 107 Shuttle Press Kit: Providing 24/7 Space Science Research"",""publicationDate"":""2002-12-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20030011376,""title"":""STS 107 Shuttle Press Kit: Providing 24/7 Space Science Research""},{""id"":20030011376,""title"":""STS 107 Shuttle Press Kit: Providing 24/7 Space Science Research""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20030011385

20130000779,ABSTRACT,International Space Station as Analog of Interplanetary Transit Vehicle For Biomedical Research,"[""Charles, John B.""]","Astronaut missions lasting up to six months aboard the International Space Station (ISS) have much in common with interplanetary flights, especially the outbound, Earth-to-Mars transit portion of a Mars mission. Utilization of ISS and other appropriate platforms to prepare for crewed expeditions to planetary destinations including Mars has been the work of NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) since 2005. HRP is charged specifically to understand and reduced the risks to astronaut health and performance in space exploration missions: everything HRP does and has done is directly related to that responsibility. Two major categories of human research have capitalized on ISS capabilities. The first category centers on the biomedical aspects of long-duration exposure to spaceflight factors, including prolonged weightlessness, radiation exposure, isolation and confinement, and actual risk to life and limb. These studies contribute to astronaut safety, health and efficiency on any long-duration missions, whether in low Earth orbit (LEO) or beyond. Qualitatively, weightlessness is weightlessness, whether in LEO or en route to Mars. The HRP sponsors investigations into losses in muscle and bone integrity, cardiovascular function, sensory-motor capability, immune capacity and psychosocial health, and development and demonstration of appropriate treatments and preventative measures. The second category includes studies that are focused on planetary expeditions beyond LEO. For these, ISS offers a high fidelity analog to investigate the combined effects of spaceflight factors (described above) plus the isolation and autonomy associated with simulated increasing distance from Earth. Investigations address crew cohesion, performance and workload, and mission control performance. The behavioral health and performance and space human factors aspects of planetary missions dominate this category. Work has already begun on a new investigation in this category which will examine the effects of a simulated lag in communications (mimicking that expected in transit to Mars) on astronaut performance aboard ISS. Extension of the current ISS increment duration from six months to nine or even twelve months would provide opportunities for expanded research relevant to long duration missions, albeit at the cost of fewer astronauts as subjects for those investigations. Given the possible limited access to ISS after 2020, if ISS is intended to facilitate future exploration missions, then the in-flight human investigations should focus on those that clearly enable future exploration missions.","[{""submissionId"":20130000779,""id"":""45bede661f304ac3918d29f5ce0902d6"",""publicationDate"":""2012-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Italy"",""submissionId"":20130000779,""endDate"":""2012-10-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""63rd International Astronautical Congress 2012"",""location"":""Naples"",""id"":""f3ad4c54677d4885860a6e43c1d501e5"",""startDate"":""2012-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20130000779
20140013318,ABSTRACT,Concepts to Support HRP Integration Using Publications and Modeling,"[""Mindock, J."",""Lumpkins, S."",""Shelhamer, M.""]","Initial efforts are underway to enhance the Human Research Program (HRP)'s identification and support of potential cross-disciplinary scientific collaborations. To increase the emphasis on integration in HRP's science portfolio management, concepts are being explored through the development of a set of tools. These tools are intended to enable modeling, analysis, and visualization of the state of the human system in the spaceflight environment; HRP's current understanding of that state with an indication of uncertainties; and how that state changes due to HRP programmatic progress and design reference mission definitions. In this talk, we will discuss proof-of-concept work performed using a subset of publications captured in the HRP publications database. The publications were tagged in the database with words representing factors influencing health and performance in spaceflight, as well as with words representing the risks HRP research is reducing. Analysis was performed on the publication tag data to identify relationships between factors and between risks. Network representations were then created as one type of visualization of these relationships. This enables future analyses of the structure of the networks based on results from network theory. Such analyses can provide insights into HRP's current human system knowledge state as informed by the publication data. The network structure analyses can also elucidate potential improvements by identifying network connections to establish or strengthen for maximized information flow. The relationships identified in the publication data were subsequently used as inputs to a model captured in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), which functions as a repository for relationship information to be gleaned from multiple sources. Example network visualization outputs from a simple SysML model were then also created to compare to the visualizations based on the publication data only. We will also discuss ideas for building upon this proof-of-concept work to further support an integrated approach to human spaceflight risk reduction.","[{""submissionId"":20140013318,""id"":""2a97328cfe18411eb91f56e023f53fd1"",""publicationDate"":""2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140013318,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""a4ed30a45c844658b1f7422c11fde14a""},{""submissionId"":20140013318,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""7fdcfdb84b2347ff80531e6b9fc5bca7""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140013318,""endDate"":""2015-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""4a14bb86832e4da5839fd177eb9f274d"",""id"":""9aa6690aba73447d8b5c0ced8e690613""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""4a14bb86832e4da5839fd177eb9f274d"",""id"":""b4964f5662af487f8906f81bfe664aa9""}],""name"":""2015 Human Research Program Investigator''s Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""4a14bb86832e4da5839fd177eb9f274d"",""startDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Transportation And Safety"",""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140013318
20240004917,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Conclusions of A Mini Technical Interchange Meeting on New Cross Risk Integration Projects Managed By the NASA Space Radiation Element ,"[""Janapriya Saha"",""Janice Zawaski""]","To enable deep space exploration and sustained human presence in space, the NASA Human Research Program’s (HRP) Space Radiation Element (SRE) funds research to characterize and mitigate adverse health outcomes from exposure to space radiation. Recently, the Space Radiation Element was tasked with supporting multiple HRP Elements with innovative and enabling projects to inform risk characterization, facilitate mitigation activities, and support crew health and performance. These projects, such as precision health initiative, NASA Omics Archive (NOA) and human sample repositories, are agnostic to any HRP Element, hence the name, Cross Risk Integration Projects (CRIP).

CRIP serves three broad purposes:
	Services: Generate samples/data or manage the receipt, inventory, archive and ultimate redistribution of biospecimens created in HRP-funded spaceflight and analog research activities – includes NASA Omics Archive (NOA) project and various human and animal sample repositories.
	Method Development: Identify and evaluate, new-to-NASA research or analysis methods or techniques – includes TRRaC (Translational Radiation Research and Countermeasures) Project. 
	Enabling Capabilities: Demonstrate real world application by adapting, adopting and/or developing capabilities to benefit crew health & performance and improve risk – includes Precision Health Initiative (Pharmacogenomics) and advanced biological systems and engineered tissue microsystems initiative (tissue chips, organ-on-a-chip).

To identify new technologies, future work, and solicitations, the SRE organizes themed sessions at annual HRP Investigators’ Workshops (IWS). These technical interchange meetings (TIMs) provide a venue for the scientific community to present ongoing work and engage in open discussion, limitations of current approaches, and incorporation of novel experimental strategies and other innovative techniques. Here a summary and lessons learned from the SRE-sponsored mini-TIM titled “Space Radiation Cross Risk Integrations Projects” at HRP IWS 2024 will be communicated. The 90-min TIM had 6 speakers who presented impressive novel ideas and work This poster presents the outcomes of the session along with proposed future workshops and other SRE initiatives.","[{""submissionId"":20240004917,""id"":""770eaa1751ec40d89b56810b2a1fbf14"",""publicationName"":""""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240004917,""endDate"":""2024-09-18T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""426499858bfb5eeebee9bd0b63129b00"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Bozeman, Montana, United States""}},""meetingId"":""cb905154d99245be884d501f85354d3a"",""id"":""e067e10db5704c80a9372ffda285f6d8""}],""name"":""70th Annual Meeting of the Radiation Research Society "",""location"":""Tucson, AZ"",""id"":""cb905154d99245be884d501f85354d3a"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/f628c567-73e4-4fee-a58b-1e9b6b0c1981/summary"",""startDate"":""2024-09-15T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.01.02.11.0771""]",undefined,"[""Space Radiation""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240004917
20150016963,OTHER,"Risk of Performance and Behavioral Health Decrements Due to Inadequate Cooperation, Coordination, Communication, and Psychosocial Adaptation within a Team","[""Landon, Lauren Blackwell"",""Vessey, William B."",""Barrett, Jamie D.""]","A team is defined as: ""two or more individuals who interact socially and adaptively, have shared or common goals, and hold meaningful task interdependences; it is hierarchically structured and has a limited life span; in it expertise and roles are distributed; and it is embedded within an organization/environmental context that influences and is influenced by ongoing processes and performance outcomes"" (Salas, Stagl, Burke, & Goodwin, 2007, p. 189). From the NASA perspective, a team is commonly understood to be a collection of individuals that is assigned to support and achieve a particular mission. Thus, depending on context, this definition can encompass both the spaceflight crew and the individuals and teams in the larger multi-team system who are assigned to support that crew during a mission. The Team Risk outcomes of interest are predominantly performance related, with a secondary emphasis on long-term health; this is somewhat unique in the NASA HRP in that most Risk areas are medically related and primarily focused on long-term health consequences. In many operational environments (e.g., aviation), performance is assessed as the avoidance of errors. However, the research on performance errors is ambiguous. It implies that actions may be dichotomized into ""correct"" or ""incorrect"" responses, where incorrect responses or errors are always undesirable. Researchers have argued that this dichotomy is a harmful oversimplification, and it would be more productive to focus on the variability of human performance and how organizations can manage that variability (Hollnagel, Woods, & Leveson, 2006) (Category III1). Two problems occur when focusing on performance errors: 1) the errors are infrequent and, therefore, difficult to observe and record; and 2) the errors do not directly correspond to failure. Research reveals that humans are fairly adept at correcting or compensating for performance errors before such errors result in recognizable or recordable failures. Astronauts are notably adept high performers. Most failures are recorded only when multiple, small errors occur and humans are unable to recognize and correct or compensate for these errors in time to prevent a failure (Dismukes, Berman, Loukopoulos, 2007) (Category III). More commonly, observers record variability in levels of performance. Some teams commit no observable errors but fail to achieve performance objectives or perform only adequately, while other teams commit some errors but perform spectacularly. Successful performance, therefore, cannot be viewed as simply the absence of errors or the avoidance of failure Johnson Space Center (JSC) Joint Leadership Team, 2008). While failure is commonly attributed to making a major error, focusing solely on the elimination of error(s) does not significantly reduce the risk of failure. Failure may also occur when performance is simply insufficient or an effort is incapable of adjusting sufficiently to a contextual change (e.g., changing levels of autonomy).","[{""submissionId"":20150016963,""id"":""e864bbf274854ad18f8eba0de3bcf70f"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150016963

To fully enable reduced gravity operation onboard the space station, we incorporated bubble-free fluidics, electromagnetic shielding, and gravity-independent sample introduction. We show microvolume flow cytometry from 10 μL sample drops, with data from five simultaneous channels using 10 μs bin intervals during each sample run, yielding an average of 72 million raw data points in approximately 2 minutes. We demonstrate the device measures each test sample repeatably, including correct identification of a sample that degraded in transit to the International Space Station.

20070028552,PREPRINT,Artificial Gravity: Will it Preserve Bone Health on Long-Duration Missions?,"[""Davis-Street, Janis"",""Paloski, William H.""]","Prolonged microgravity exposure disrupts bone, muscle, and cardiovascular homeostasis, sensory-motor coordination, immune function, and behavioral performance. Bone loss, in particular, remains a serious impediment to the success of exploration-class missions by increasing the risks of bone fracture and renal stone formation for crew members. Current countermeasures, consisting primarily of resistive and aerobic exercise, have not yet proven fully successful for preventing bone loss during long-duration spaceflight. While other bone-specific countermeasures, such as pharmacological therapy and dietary modifications, are under consideration, countermeasure approaches that simultaneously address multiple physiologic systems may be more desirable for exploration-class missions, particularly if they can provide effective protection at reduced mission resource requirements (up-mass, power, crew time, etc). The most robust of the multi-system approaches under consideration, artificial gravity (AG), could prevent all of the microgravity-related physiological changes from occurring. The potential methods for realizing an artificial gravity countermeasure are reviewed, as well as selected animal and human studies evaluating the effects of artificial gravity on bone function. Future plans for the study of the multi-system effects of artificial gravity include a joint, cooperative international effort that will systematically seek an optimal prescription for intermittent AG to preserve bone, muscle, and cardiovascular function in human subjects deconditioned by 6 degree head-down-tilt-bed rest. It is concluded that AG has great promise as a multi-system countermeasure, but that further research is required to determine the appropriate parameters for implementation of such a countermeasure for exploration-class missions.","[{""submissionId"":20070028552,""id"":""31485529373b4f83b0cc9463b48540c0"",""publicationDate"":""2005-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20070028552,""name"":""Cleveland Clinic Foundation"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH, United States"",""id"":""95ca9578eb914e6f834864f1216e9f1d""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20070028552,""endDate"":""2005-06-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Cleveland Clinic Foundation"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH, United States""}},""meetingId"":""25e298bd3de04dfbb575faf9c6eac7a4"",""id"":""3af3694cbbdb4c89bc296709405f2eac""}],""name"":""Bone Loss During Space Flight"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH"",""id"":""25e298bd3de04dfbb575faf9c6eac7a4"",""startDate"":""2005-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070028552

For humans, these harmful environmental factors have been known to cause negative health impacts such as immune dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceflight impacts human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately assessing the risks associated with spaceflight, but also for developing effective countermeasures. This study is part of the Functional Immune Project, intended to determine alterations in crewmembers` immunobiology before, during, and after spaceflight. For this project, blood samples were collected from International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers at the following time points: i) at two pre-flight time points of 180 days (L180) and 45 days (L45) before launch. ii) During flight, blood was drawn at approximately the midpoint (mid-flight, MF) of the mission, and shortly before egress from the ISS (late-flight, LF). iii) Post-flight blood samples were collected within 24 hrs (R0), 30 days (R30) and 90 days (R90) after landing. For each crewmember, blood was also drawn from a matching test subject on the ground at the corresponding time point. For both the ISS crewmembers and the ground control subjects, total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and mRNA was analysed using next generation RNA-sequencing (NGS). Differentially expressed genes were determined by performing contrast analysis. Using the ground control subjects of all of the time points combined as a control, a number of dysregulated genes were identified in astronauts at MF, LF and R0, including downregulations of SMAD7 and CDKN1A at MF and LF. Some of the genes such as SERPINE1 and VEGFA were downregulated at MF and LF, but upregulated at R0, while others such as NKG7 were down regulated at all of the 3 time points. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated that the NF-κB pathway was chronically activated in space. Analysis of the consequent diseases suggested potential associations with not only immune dysfunction, but also other health risks including osteoarthritis, cardiac hypertrophy and neuroinflammation.

20250000773,POSTER,Incorporation of Human Risk Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) With Mishap Investigations to Un-Silo Knowledge,"[""Samuel Jacobs"",""Avalon Kabeel"",""Kim Lowe"",""Dan Buckland"",""Mary Van Baalen""]","
NASA’s Human System Risk Board (HSRB) has been a central driver in efforts to understand, mitigate, and communicate the 29 human systems risks monitored by the board. As a result of the collaboration between research, operations, and technical authorities, large bodies of knowledge have been collected and digested to represent the current understanding of the risks. As a part of these bodies of knowledge, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have been developed to communicate the current understanding of the causal relationship of the hazards, contributing factors, countermeasures, other risks, and outcomes that contribute to the overall risk. This risk knowledge is applied in a theoretical sense for potential incidents during exploration even while informed by surveillance data. However, there have been mishaps and close calls during past space exploration that intersect with one or more of the Human System Risks DAGs and knowledge bases. The purpose of this exercise was to un-silo this risk knowledge and connect it to the close call of EVA 23 through the development of a DAG representing the intersection of the HSRB Risks and the events of the close call.

The development of the DAG occurred through an iterative process, with each iteration expanding and/or refining the nodes and connections described by the source materials. In addition to the risk documentation developed by the HSRB, lessons learned and other mishap investigation documents were utilized to understand the events that led to water entering the helmet of a crewmember on the EVA. New nodes specific to the events of EVA 23 were interconnected with existing HSRB DAG nodes and edges. Nodes within the DAG were defined within a “DAG-tionary” with any updates to a definition that may have previously existed from the HSRB DAGs, and edges were recorded in a matrix. Both the DAG-tionary and matrix describe where nodes and edges are present across the Risk and Mishap DAG. This DAG will then be reviewed by experts outside of HSRB and HRP to confirm that interpretations of the non-health related events (such as the engineering nodes) are represented accurately.

<b>DISCUSSION</b>
This process highlighted a method by which the knowledge generated among the contributing members of the HSRB Risks can be effectively adapted and utilized through the tools employed by the Risk Custodian teams. By leveraging these tools, new context and insights to the information at hand can be brought forward to address current spaceflight challenges. Moreover, un-siloing this knowledge through future DAGs and other efforts can drive interprofessional collaboration and foster communication. This will enable teams to work together more effectively, leveraging their diverse expertise to tackle the complex challenges of space exploration and human research. Ultimately, this collaboration will bring NASA closer to achieve agency goals and contribute to the overall shared mission and vision.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20250000773,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""01f50ff33177442491a82dbc9a649473"",""id"":""430ddb1a4c55450581788ae8f6e41002""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""01f50ff33177442491a82dbc9a649473"",""url"":""https://www.nasa.gov/hrp/iws-2025/"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.04.01.05.1688"",""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Documentation and Information Science""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250000773

20190001971,ABSTRACT,Maiden Voyage of the Rodent Habitat on ISS: Opportunities for Investigating Molecular Mechanisms and Biomedical Consequences of Long Duration Spaceflight,"[""Globus, R. K."",""Choi, S."",""Wigley, C."",""Pletcher, D."",""Beegle, J.""]","Research using rodents is an essential tool for advancing biomedical research on Earth and in space. The National Research Counsel’s Decadal survey (1) emphasized the importance of expanding NASAs life sciences research to perform long duration, rodent experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). To accomplish this objective, flight hardware, operations, and science capabilities were developed at NASA ARC to support both commercial and government-sponsored research. In preparation for the maiden voyage of the Rodent Habitat hardware and operations system (Rodent Research-1), and in close consultation with a Science Working Group comprised of veterinarians and experienced spaceflight investigators, we modified existing Animal Enclosure Module hardware, developed new hardware, operations, and science activities, and performed a series of ground-based verification tests. Preflight, ground based hardware tests included a simulation of SpaceX Dragon launch conditions (vibration and hypergravity) using the Transporter, and also two long-term biocompatibility tests (32 and 92 days) using the Habitat developed for long term housing on the ISS. The launch simulation test showed that adult mice housed in Transporter hardware adapted well, even if launch simulation was followed by a period of simulated weightlessness (via hind limb unloading). The biocompatibility tests demonstrated that the Habitat successfully supported animal health and also provided a useful video imaging system that enables frequent monitoring of animal health and behavior by veterinary and scientific experts on the ground, independent of ISS crew intervention. At the conclusion of all tests, mice were deemed healthy and suitable for conducting biological research. Additional preflight analyses of tissues preserved by freezing or fixation for gene expression analyses revealed that spleen and liver tissues recovered under conditions that simulated on-orbit activities yielded high quality RNA (RIN values 8-10) and liver enzyme activities and protein content (e.g. catalase). In addition, new methods were developed to optimize future science return by dissecting tissues post-euthanasia and storage. Various tissues were harvested from either intact or partially dissected, frozen carcasses after storage for ~2-6 months; most of the tissues (brain, heart, kidney, eye, adrenal glands and skeletal muscle) were of high RNA quality for science return, whereas some tissues (small intestine, bone marrow and bones) were not. These data demonstrated the protocols developed for future flight experiments supported science return despite delayed preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage, and furthermore, that high-quality RNA samples from many different tissues can be recovered by dissection following prolonged storage of the tissue in situ at -80˚C. The first flight experiments carrying 20 mice were launched on Sept 21, 2014 in an unmanned Dragon Capsule, SpaceX4; Rodent Research-1 is dedicated to achieving both NASA validation and CASIS science objectives. Ground based control groups (housed in flight hardware or standard cages) were maintained in environmental chambers at Kennedy Space Center. Crewmembers previously trained in animal handling transferred mice from the Transporter into Habitats under simultaneous veterinary supervision by video streaming and were deemed healthy. Health and behavior of all mice on the ISS was monitored by video feed on a daily basis. The 10 mice for validation (16wk old, female C57Bl6/J) ambulated freely and actively throughout the Habitat, relying heavily on their forelimbs for locomotion. The first on-orbit dissections of mice were performed successfully on Oct 12 and 13, 2014, and the validation mice will reside on ISS for up to 30 days.

It  is  well-known  that  sleep  is  essential  for  proper  immunological  and  neurological  functioning,  while impairments in these functions result in risks for spaceflight success. Neuropeptides and hormones are involved in regulating the circadian clock and are used as biomarkers for circadian alignment. However, in-flight monitoring of these biomarkers is limited due to the lack of real-time sensor systems and sample collection/processing confines. Therefore, real-time measurements of biomarkers in-flight are necessary for mission success and crew health. For this, a robust biomarker involved in the neuro-immune axis of circadian rhythm cycling, physiological stress responses, and inflammation would be well-received as a viable biomarker  for  assessing physiological  health  for  crew  during  long-duration  missions,  as  these  are  currently NASA  Human Research Program defined risks. Therefore, this paper describes the development of a wearables we at biosensor to measure the biological  clock  neuropeptide,  orexin/hypocretin.  Additionally, potential  for  implementation  of  a user-friendly  sensor  of orexin/hypocretin to be telemetrically reported in real-time, is proposed.

20240011322,POSTER,Conclusions of a Mini Technical Interchange Meeting on New Cross Risk Integration Projects Managed by the NASA Space Radiation Element,"[""Janapriya Saha"",""Janice Zawaski""]","To enable deep space exploration and sustained human presence in space, the NASA Human Research Program’s (HRP) Space Radiation Element (SRE) funds research to characterize and mitigate adverse health outcomes from exposure to space radiation that include risks of carcinogenesis, cardiovascular disease, and central nervous system decrements. Recently, the SRE was tasked with supporting multiple HRP Elements with innovative and enabling projects to inform risk characterization, facilitate mitigation activities, and support crew health and performance. These projects, such as precision health initiative, NASA Omics Archive (NOA) and human sample repositories, are agnostic to any HRP Element, hence the name, Cross-Risk Integration Projects (CRIP). 

CRIP serves 3 broad purposes: 
 - Services: Generate samples and data and manage the receipt, inventory, archive, and ultimate redistribution of biospecimens created in HRP-funded spaceflight and analog research activities—includes NASA Omics Archive project and various human and animal sample repositories. 
 - Method Development: Identify and evaluate new-to-NASA research or analysis methods or techniques that could fundamentally improve existing or planned research efforts—includes the Translational Radiation Research and Countermeasures Project.
 - Enabling Capabilities: Demonstrate real-world application by adapting, adopting, and/or developing capabilities to benefit crew health and performance and improve risk mitigation—includes Precision Health Initiative (Pharmacogenomics) and advanced biological systems and engineered tissue microsystems initiative (tissue chips, organ-on-a-chip).

To identify new technologies, future work, and solicitations, the SRE organizes themed sessions at annual HRP Investigators’ Workshops (IWS). These technical interchange meetings (TIMs) provide a venue for the scientific community to present ongoing work and engage in open discussion of results, limitations of current approaches, and incorporation of novel experimental strategies, model systems, and other innovative techniques. Here, a summary of the studies presented at the SRE-sponsored mini-TIM at the HRP IWS along with the goals and objectives of the CRIP projects is communicated. The 90-min TIM had 6 speakers who presented impressive novel ideas and work, some of which are funded under CRIP by the Space Radiation Element.","[{""submissionId"":20240011322,""publisher"":""Radiation Research Society"",""id"":""9798037ef5144e75bbed96cf4a3ca77b"",""publicationName"":"""",""publicationDate"":""2024-09-15T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240011322,""endDate"":""2024-09-18T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""426499858bfb5eeebee9bd0b63129b00"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Bozeman, Montana, United States""}},""meetingId"":""8d21bdcfd042402db07ee9c460aa834a"",""id"":""a6fabdd0fe074ded8184532526b2772c""}],""name"":""70th Annual Meeting of the Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Tucson, AZ"",""id"":""8d21bdcfd042402db07ee9c460aa834a"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/f628c567-73e4-4fee-a58b-1e9b6b0c1981/summary"",""startDate"":""2024-09-15T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.01.02.11.0771""]",undefined,"[""Space Radiation"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240011322

To ensure occupants’ health and safety during their spaceflight residency, Environmental Health System (EHS) microbial samples including air, surface, and water, are collected, enumerated, and analyzed quarterly to monitor on-board system contamination and potential risks to crew health. Quarterly monitoring of the microorganisms in the ISS environment supports crew safety and contributes to a large set of microbial concentration and diversity data. Based upon data historically collected over the years, in-flight microbial requirements have been established to maintain the health and safety of the spacecraft environment. This study leverages quarterly operational Environmental Health System (EHS) sampling by collecting additional microbial samples from the surface of the station’s Veggie plant production system. Microbial surface samples collected from the Veggie plant production system will yield microbial concentration and diversity that can be compared and analyzed with nominal surface samples from the vehicle.  The data collected in this study will aid in the development of requirements for spaceflight-based food production systems. Continued surface sampling of the internal and external surfaces of the Veggie locker, along with collaboration from both Johnson Space Center (JSC) & Kennedy Space Center (KSC) scientists studying the microbiome of the veggie-crop systems, will be implemented as part of the future development of crop-based food system requirements for the ISS and beyond.

Tending plants also may serve as a countermeasure for crew psychological stresses associated with long duration spaceflight. However, requirements to support consistent growth of a variety of high quality, nutritious crops under spaceflight environmental conditions is unknown. This study is exploring the potential to grow plants for food production on the International Space Station (ISS) using the Veggie vegetable production system. Ground testing is underway to compare the impacts of several fertilizer and lighting treatments on growth, quality, and nutritional composition of the leafy green crop mizuna, and the dwarf tomato crop ""Red Robin"" when subjected to Veggie ISS environmental conditions. Early testing focused on the leafy crop ""Tokyo Bekana"" Chinese cabbage, but ground tests indicated that this plant suffered from stress responses when grown under LEDs and the chronically elevated CO2 levels found on the ISS. Mizuna, a related leafy variety that grows well in the presence of high CO2, and has excellent organoleptic characteristics, was selected as an alternate crop. Tomato crops have been grown using two fertilizer formulations and two pollination techniques, and growth tests using different red:blue lighting environments are underway. Chemical analysis is also being conducted and these data, when coupled with the growth results, will be used to down-select to the two best lighting treatments and best fertilizer treatment for future testing of each crop on the ISS. Additionally, seed-source testing has become important, with mizuna seeds from two different vendors growing very differently. A seed source has been selected, and seed-surface-sanitizing methods have been confirmed for mizuna, but these remain under development for tomato. A crop-handling protocol is also being evaluated to support food safety. All harvests reserve a subset of samples for microbial analysis to determine baseline microbial levels and help establish critical control points for food safety. Testing was initially conducted in hardware analogs of the standard Veggie plant pillows. However, a new Veggie watering system, the Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System or PONDS, has been designed and is being prepared for future flight experiments. With the selection of this growth system, ground tests have shifted to analog PONDS systems. Crop tests on ISS, designated VEG-04 for mizuna and VEG-05 for tomato, are planned in 2018 to evaluate any additional impacts of spaceflight on the light and fertilizer conditions down-selected from ground tests. A set of Veggie-specific questions has been developed to characterize the psychological impacts of plant growth and plant-care activities during spaceflight. Organoleptic questionnaires have been developed to assess produce attributes in microgravity taste sessions. These tests for plants growing in the Veggie hardware on ISS will help to mitigate the risk of an inadequate food supply for long duration missions by developing methods and determining hardware requirements to integrate fresh vegetables as a dietary supplement. This research was co-funded by the Human Research Program and Space Biology (MTL#1075) in the ILSRA 2015 NRA call.","[{""submissionId"":20180004272,""id"":""a1660b63b019494a9683d81490495aef"",""publicationDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20180004272,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""c11fef1b6c10428a8d527abea0f978c1""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180004272,""endDate"":""2018-01-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ef1a5f3dd4564168bbd289ff57018e85"",""id"":""73c22825c2d84f5fa84017d4d4260168""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2018)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""ef1a5f3dd4564168bbd289ff57018e85"",""startDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNK11EA08C"",""NNX15AN78G"",""NNJ15HK11B"",""PIA PIP 13""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180004272

The effect of altered gravity during space flight and planetary transition on human cardiovascular function is of critical importance to maintenance of astronaut health and safety. Hypovolemia, reduced plasma volume, is suspected to play an important role in cardiovascular deconditioning following exposure to spaceflight, which may lead to increased peripheral resistance, attenuated arterial baroreflex, and changes in cardiac function. A promising countermeasure for post-flight orthostatic intolerance is fluid loading used to restore lost plasma volume by giving crew salt tablets and water prior to re-entry. The main purpose of the proposed study is to define the temporal profile of cardiac responses to simulated 0-G conditions before and following a fluid loading countermeasure. 8 men and 8 women will be tested during 4 hour exposures at 6o head down tilt (HDT). Each subject will be given two exposures to HDT on separate days, one with and one without fluid loading (one liter of 0.9% saline solution).

V.""]","NASA in its plans to send humans to distant destination such as Mars faces the health and physiological performance problems caused by microgravity and space radiation. While most of the environmental conditions in spacecraft during flight can be made to mimic terrestrial conditions, microgravity cannot yet be managed. This space environmental factor has a major impact on the body’s biological system forcing alterations, in order to adapt to this new environment. Most space flight and ground-based studies suggest that prolonged exposure to microgravity leads to significant skeletal muscle atrophy, bone loss, and results in suppression of total metabolism. Due to microgravity, unloaded crewmembers lose up to 1.5% of their skeletal mass and 1.8% of bone strength each month during ISS missions. Remarkably many animals, including human-size bears, which are largely inactive during the 6 to 8 months of hibernation, show no loss in bone mass and much less muscle atrophy than would be anticipated over such a prolonged period of physical inactivity. This suggests that while in a suppressed metabolic state animals have unique natural mechanisms to prevent muscle disuse and bone atrophy. The molecular mechanisms underlying these important adaptations are not yet known. Radiation exposure is the second health hazard encountered during spaceflight that can cause radiation sickness, cancer or death. This study provides new evidence that metabolic activity levels play a critical role in radioprotection. Metabolic suppression, as an adaptive response of cells to minimize damage caused by radiation, enables cells to reduce cellular dysfunction and damage, and prolong their survival despite persistent oxidative stress. Thus mechanistic understanding of metabolism offers a means for sustaining astronauts in long-duration missions. The ultimate goals of this study are to demonstrate that induced metabolic suppression in animals and humans will profoundly reduce their sensitivity to the damaging effects of radiation and microgravity as well as other kinds of stresses caused by spaceflight. The beneficial effects of suppressed metabolism induced by different factors such as temperature, nutrition, and medications, will not only mitigate the most detrimental hazards of spaceflight but also radically reduce mission life support requirements and spaceflight logistics.","[{""submissionId"":20190001124,""id"":""42ad386eaa1845e7829d2b386f34cac7"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190001124,""endDate"":""2015-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""532c631adef14b02a29dc8fbc6c0dde2"",""id"":""f6766988dd7c4903bffe4ee219361e39""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""532c631adef14b02a29dc8fbc6c0dde2"",""startDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190001124

Winther"",""Emily Griffin"",""Michael Krihak""]","The major health hazards of spaceflight include higher levels of damaging radiation, altered gravity, extended periods of isolation and confinement, a closed and potentially hostile living environment, and the stress associated with being a long distance from Earth. As we increase the duration of lunar stays with foreseeable communication latencies and disruptions, there will be a progressive need for crew to maintain their own health and independently respond to critical medical events. The Exploration Medical Capability element of the NASA Human Research Program is developing a set of Medical System requirements for lunar transit and surface operations. These requirements specify the capabilities, processes and procedures of a habitat Medical System needed for a range of conditions known to occur during spaceflight. Requirement text is written so as not to constrain innovative design solutions necessary for a resilient system. The requirement set includes attributes and functions the Medical System imposes on eight additional habitat systems. A key property of the Medical System is the provision of medical knowledge that will be stored, updated, analyzed, and secured within a Habitat Data System. A Task Performance Support System will aid in medical data acquisition and interpretation, crew training, medical condition prevention, diagnosis and treatment, provide interactive procedures, and track medical inventory. A Wellness System will focus on the provision of countermeasures to prevent, mitigate or treat adverse physical and behavioral health effects while the Medical System recommends adjustments to these countermeasures to maintain crew health. An Environmental Monitoring System will share out-of-bounds readings of air and water quality, acoustics, and radiation exposure levels with the Medical System to help identify issues before they affect crew health and performance. A Communications System will provide secured and private consultations between crew and the ground medical team and their loved ones on Earth. The Medical System also imposes requirements on a Research & Testbed System, fostering advanced medical science such as human research. A Waste Management System provides biohazard waste containment and waste disposal options (recycle and reuse). An Extravehicular Activity System supports crew health during lunar surface activities.

20230014322,POSTER,Comparison of Active and Passive Head Impulse Testing of the Horizontal Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex: Exploring the Feasibility of Different Approaches for Spaceflight,"[""M R Ehrenburg"",""M J Carey"",""T R Macaulay"",""S J Wood""]","INTRODUCTION: Astronauts experience a wide variety of sensorimotor disturbances primarily due to microgravity-induced vestibular adaptations during spaceflight. Head Impulse Testing (HIT) will be conducted during the Complement of Integrated Protocols for Human Exploration Research program(CIPHER) Vestibular Health study to examine changes in the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex in response to high-velocity head movements to detect changes in peripheral vestibular function [1,2]. However, correct interpretation will require consideration of potential artifacts and the constraints of conducting this test across different phases of the mission. Therefore, the aims of our study were to (1) examine reliability across different test operators, and (2) compare results of active (aHIT) versus passive (pHIT) approaches to evaluate the feasibility of self-administered versus operator-assisted approaches. A comparison of responses with visual viewing of a wall target (default condition) versus vision occluded evaluated the influence of other oculomotor control influence across conditions, and comparison with computer-generated rotator head impulse tests (rHIT) examined   the variability associated with the ocular responses independent of the variability in executing the head movements themselves.

METHODS: Seventeen non-astronaut volunteers (male n=12, age=22.9 ± 3.0; female n=5, age=27.0 ± 6.0, mean ± std) completed HIT testing using video-oculography (VOG) goggles and a high-torque rotator system. The test order was counterbalanced across conditions: (1) passive head-on-torso (pHIT, default condition for flight study) using two operators (Op1 and Op2), (2) active head-on-torso (aHIT, subject initiated), and (3) passive head and torso using rotary chair (rHIT). Eye and head movement data were processed to obtain gain in each direction. The main outcome measures were average gain and asymmetry [1], as well as the percentage of acceptable trials not excluded due to insufficient head amplitude or recording artifacts.

RESULTS: While the pHIT gains were similar with vision (1.032 ± 0.043) and vision occluded (1.029 ± 0.038) conditions, the percentage of acceptable trials was greater with vision (Op1 = 93.0%, Op2 = 93.2%) versus occluded (Op1 = 70.7%, Op2 = 67.6%). The reliability between operators was greater for pHIT gain (Intraclass Correlation, ICC = 0.66, p = 0.001) than for pHIT asymmetry (ICC = 0.57, p = 0.01). The percentage of acceptable trials reduced by ~20% during the self-administered aHITs for both visual conditions and tended to be lower than computer-generated rHITs (76% versus 83%). While the aHIT gains were not significantly different than pHIT gains for vision or vision occluded conditions, these measures were poorly correlated. Both aHIT and pHIT gains were significantly greater than the rHIT gains, presumably due to the reduced velocities from the rotator. The asymmetry measures were poorly correlated across pHIT, aHIT, and rHIT conditions, although none of the subjects had asymmetries greater than 16%.  

DISCUSSION: Our findings support the feasibility of using the standard pHIT methodology for spaceflight. Similarities between visual conditions reflect that these responses are mediated by the peripheral lateral canals rather than other oculomotor mechanisms.

A high PMN to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can acts as a poor prognosis in cancer and a biomarker for subclinical inflammation however, the NLR has not been identified as a predictor of astronaut health during spaceflight. CBC data collected on board the International Space Station (ISS) was repurposed to determine the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio (GLR) in humans and the NLR in rodents. The results displayed a progressive increase in GLR and NLR during spaceflight and at landing. The mechanism for increased NLR was assessed in vitro using the microgravity-analog, rotating wall vessel (RWV), with human WBCs. The results indicated that simulated microgravity led to increased GLR and NLR profiles, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Interestingly, simulated microgravity increased the number of matured PMNs that showed impaired phagocytic function, while treatment with tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), also reduced PMN phagocytosis. In addition, 30-days of simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading) in mice, indicated an increased NLR and MPO gene expression, which were mitigated in mitochondrial catalase overexpressing transgenic mice, suggesting ROS scavenging is essential for maintaining homeostatic immunity. Collectively, we propose that the health status of astronauts during future short- and long-term space missions can be monitored by their NLR profile, in addition to utilizing this measurement as a tool for oxidative stress response countermeasure development to restore homeostatic immunity.","[{""submissionId"":20190033110,""id"":""fb2d777170744532a84dc23903f94aeb"",""publicationDate"":""2019-05-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190033110,""name"":""American Association of Immunologists"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States"",""id"":""726b5b089c24453bb3820ad8d3e00536""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190033110,""endDate"":""2019-05-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Association of Immunologists"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6b5473d5704d447e9960f8626f0eac2a"",""id"":""a842f9f6ebb04c3488662e646540c965""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Association of Immunologists (AAI) Immunology 2019"",""location"":""San Diego, CA"",""id"":""6b5473d5704d447e9960f8626f0eac2a"",""startDate"":""2019-05-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C"",""NNH15CO48B"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190033110

MEDPRAT utilizes discrete event modeling and dynamic probabilistic simulation to predict critical mission outcomes (total medical events, crew health index, quality time lost, loss of crew life, removal to definitive care), condition occurrences, and resource consumption. Input parameters for MEDPRAT include crew attributes (e.g., sex), types of mission activities (e.g., whether and where crew members perform an extravehicular activity (EVA)), available resources, treatment information, and probability distributions for medical conditions. As an evolution of the Integrated Medical Model (IMM), MEDPRAT provides enhanced capabilities and higher fidelity, and incorporates more appropriate assumptions for long-duration spaceflight. IMM is the currently accepted standard for quantifying spaceflight mission medical risk in NASA operations that uses a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) approach. MEDPRAT builds on the same logical foundation as IMM but implements the model architecture through highly optimized Monte Carlo sampling methods. An analysis is performed comparing the outputs from IMM with those from MEDPRAT V1.0 and V2.0 for the same reference missions in order to quantify similarities and differences in the model outcomes. The juxtaposition between IMM and MEDPRAT V1.0 and 2.0 shown in this report demonstrates that these two models generate very similar results; where differences in outcomes are shown, these are in accordance with the underlying assumptions and differences in the model architectures. This validation effort further establishes the credibility and reliability of the MEDPRAT software.","[{""submissionId"":20240012058,""publisher"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""id"":""c9c8bac8d5064187ba7e9148453dcb1a"",""publicationDate"":""2025-02-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B"",""80TECH21DA001"",""305041.01.02.10""]",undefined,"[""Computer Programming and Software""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240012058
20110016424,ABSTRACT,Legacy of Environmental Research During the Space Shuttle Program,"[""Lane, Helen W.""]","The Space Shuttle Program provided many opportunities to study the role of spaceflight on human life for over the last 30 years and represents the longest and largest U.S. human spaceflight program. Risks to crewmembers were included in the research areas of nutrition, microbiology, toxicology, radiation, and sleep quality. To better understand the Shuttle environment, Crew Health Care System was developed. As part of this system, the Environmental Health Subsystem was developed to monitor the atmosphere for gaseous contaminants and microbial contamination levels and to monitor water quality and radiation. This program expended a great deal of effort in studying and mitigating risks related to contaminations due to food, water, air, surfaces, crewmembers, and payloads including those with animals. As the Shuttle had limited stowage space and food selection, the development of nutritional requirements for crewmembers was imperative. As the Shuttle was a reusable vehicle, microbial contamination was of great concern. The development of monitoring instruments that could withstand the space environment took several years and many variations to come up with a suitable instrument. Research with space radiation provided an improved understanding of the various sources of ionizing radiation and the development of monitoring instrumentation for space weather and the human exposure within the orbiter's cabin. Space toxicology matured to include the management of offgassing products that could pollute the crewmembers air quality. The Shuttle Program implemented a 5-level toxicity rating system and developed new monitoring instrumentation to detect toxic compounds. The environment of space caused circadian desynchrony, sleep deficiency, and fatigue leading to much research and major emphasis on countermeasures. Outcomes of the research in these areas were countermeasures, operational protocols, and hardware. Learning Objectives: This symposium will provide an overview of the major environmental lessons learned and the development of countermeasures, monitoring hardware, and procedures.","[{""submissionId"":20110016424,""id"":""1a6b7a0fdef649059ba25f417711eb11"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110016424,""endDate"":""2012-05-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""83rd AsMA Annual Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""Atlanta, GA"",""id"":""7a5b5389bf7f45bdbb624045019855ad"",""startDate"":""2012-05-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110016424

The physiological factors involved in the performance of extensive EVA, necessary for construction and maintenance of the International Space Station and during future human interplanetary missions, require further examination. An understanding of the physiological aspects of exercise and thermoregulation in the EVA environment will help to insure the health, safety, and efficiency of working astronauts. To that end, this review will focus on the interaction of the exercise and environmental aspects of EVA, as well as exercise during spaceflight and ground-based simulations such as bed-rest deconditioning. It will examine inflight exercise thermoregulation, and exercise, muscular strength, supine vs. seated exercise, exercise thermoregulation, and exercise in a hypobaric environment. Due to the paucity of data from controlled human research in this area, it is clear that more scientific studies are needed to insure safe and efficient extravehicular activity.","[{""submissionId"":20010084315,""id"":""0990090520d44a1f861c19bce2741a61"",""publicationDate"":""2000-08-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""RTOP 111-10-20""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20010084315

Hypo-volemia is suspected to play an important role in cardiovascular deconditioning following exposure to spaceflight, which may lead to increased peripheral resistance, attenuated arterial baroreflex, and changes in cardiac function. The effect of altered gravity during space flight and planetary transition on human cardiovascular function is of critical importance to maintenance of astronaut health and safety. A promising countermeasure for post-flight orthostatic intolerance is fluid loading used to restore loss fluid volume by giving crew salt tablets and water prior to re-entry. Eight men and eight women will be tested during two, 6-hour exposures to 6o HDT: 1) fluid loading, 2) no fluid loading. Before and immediately after each HDT, subjects will perform a stand test to assess their orthostatic tolerance. Physiological measures (e.g., ECG, blood pressure, peripheral blood volume) will be continuously monitored while echocardiography measures are recorded at 30-minute intervals during HDT and stand tests. Preliminary results (N=4) clearly show individual differences in responses to this countermeasure and the time course of physiological changes induced by HDT.","[{""submissionId"":20130011049,""id"":""9655e8b06f5943afa28274b2cfd52fd5"",""publicationDate"":""2013-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20130011049,""name"":""NASA Ames Research Center"",""location"":""Moffett Field, CA, United States"",""id"":""2650ad471c7c40c7b76ac8c07705c35b""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20130011049,""endDate"":""2013-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Ames Research Center"",""location"":""Moffett Field, CA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""5779355167d74f94aee9fedbd008b5fb"",""id"":""7c61e3c627974301b9af4dc065067e10""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""5779355167d74f94aee9fedbd008b5fb"",""startDate"":""2013-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 516724.02.01.05.02.05.10"",""NNX09AG76A""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20130011049

20120015420,ABSTRACT,Spaceflight Effects and Molecular Responses in the Mouse Eye: Observations after NASA Shuttle Mission STS-133,"[""ProsperoPonce, Claudia Maria"",""Zanello, Susana B."",""Theriot, Corey A."",""Chevez-Barrios, Patricia""]","Background: Human space exploration implies a combination of stressors including microgravityinduced cephalad fluid shift and radiation exposure. Ocular changes in astronauts leading to visual impairment are of occupational health relevance. The effect of this complex environment on ocular morphology and function is poorly understood. Material and Methods: Mice were assigned to a Flight (FLT) group flown on shuttle mission STS133, Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), or vivarium (VIV) ground controls. Eyes were collected at 1, 5 and 7 days after landing, and were fixed for histological sectioning. The contralateral eye was used for gene expression profiling by qRT-PCR. Routine histology and immunohistochemistry using 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), caspase-3, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and beta-amyloid were used to study the eyes. Results and Conclusions: 8-OHdG and caspase-3 immunoreactivity was increased in the retina in FLT samples at return from flight (R+1) compared to ground controls, and decreased at day 7 (R+7), suggesting an increase in oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. FLT mice showed evidence of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) apoptosis possibly secondary to oxidative damage. Although attenuation of RPE has been related to retinal choroidal folds in astronauts, it is yet to be determined whether or not increased RPE apoptosis may contribute to the formation of choroidal folds or may increase the risk for other retinal pathologies, such as AMD. beta-amyloid was seen in the nerve fibers at the post-laminar region of the optic nerve in the flight samples (R+7). Deposition of beta-amyloid has a strong correlation with mechanical trauma. The coexpression of GFAP in astrocytes and oligodentrocytes in these same areas supports the possible mechanical origin probably secondary to intracranial pressure that is transmitted into the nerve, as a result of an increase in venous pressure associated to microgravity-induced cephalic fluid shift. However, there is the need to further investigate the nature of the changes through additional experimental work. Gene expression of oxidative and cellular stress response genes was unregulated in the retina of FLT samples upon landing followed by lower levels by R+7. These results suggest that reversible molecular damage occurs in the retina of mice exposed to spaceflight and that protective cellular and molecular pathways are induced in the retina in response to these changes.","[{""submissionId"":20120015420,""id"":""aa85de58e0bf49eda1be4055fe0bd1ed"",""publicationDate"":""2012-11-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20120015420,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""55356a1f49bb4b51aaa5668f31651cdc"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Association of Ophthalmic Oncologists and Pathologists"",""location"":""San Francisco, CA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ab8f6fd937214dab89f02059ac1d8520"",""id"":""6bd67628cd65404c8b2c2a1b56296e84""}],""name"":""2012 American Association of Ophthahnic"",""location"":""Chicago, IL"",""id"":""ab8f6fd937214dab89f02059ac1d8520"",""startDate"":""2012-11-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120015420

For humans, these harmful environmental factors have been known to cause negative health impacts such as immune dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceflight impacts human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately assessing the risks associated with spaceflight, but also for developing effective countermeasures. This study is part of the Functional Immune Project, intended to determine alterations in crewmembers` immunobiology before, during, and after spaceflight. For this project, blood samples were collected from International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers at the following time points: i) Blood was drawn at two pre-flight time points of 180 days (L180) and 45 days (L45) before launch. ii) During flight, blood was drawn at approximately the midpoint (mid-flight, MF) of the mission, and shortly before egress from the ISS (late-flight, LF). iii) Post-flight blood samples were collected within 36 hours (R0), 30 days (R30) and 90 days (R90) after landing. For each crewmember, blood was also drawn from a matching test subject on the ground at the corresponding time point. For both the ISS crewmembers and the ground control subjects, total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and mRNA was analysed using next generation RNA-sequencing (NGS). Differentially expressed genes were determined by performing contrast analysis. Using the ground control subjects of all time points combined as a control, a number of dysregulated genes were identified in astronauts at MF, LF and R0, Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated that several of the pathways related to metabolism, including LXR/RXR, NAD signaling and fatty acid betta-oxidation, were downregulated at MF and LF.

These and other potential issues will require the continuous monitoring and recognition of potentially subtle, but complex, anomalous data patterns. NASA continues to investigate real-time metrics for Extravehicular Operations1 and for providing feedback to improve performance2. Since it is unknown how long-term exposure to deep space will affect crew health, continuous monitoring of clinical and subclinical status is warranted. 
NASA is characterizing crew medical decision-support needs and identifying the recommended requirements of a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) within the Exploration Medical Capability Element (ExMC) of the Human Research Program3. Early detection, and continuous monitoring, of performance may provide an effective prognostic capability for assessing crew health state, and the identified requirements could be provided for an in-vehicle CDSS that acts as an assistant for delivering optimal health and performance and medical care during exploration missions. 
There is evidence to suggest that automatic, unobtrusive collection of keystroke features, such as alphanumeric key latencies, backspaces or typing rhythm, could be a valuable performance screening tool. Keystroke features show significant differences between control subjects and patients with overt clinical illness, such as multiple sclerosis4 and Parkinson’s disease5, as well as behavioral health and performance issues, such as mild cognitive impairment6 and depression7.
This work is exploring a capability for the assessment of early task performance decline in crew as they perform daily activities. Timestamped keyboard entries are continuously collected and stored. Nominal keystroke interactions are compared to those obtained after exposure to spaceflight stressors, e.g., fatigue, to determine the methods sensitivity.

G.""]","The NASA Digital Astronaut Project s (DAP) objective is to provide computational tools that support research of the physiological response to low gravity environments and analyses of how changes cause health and safety risks to the astronauts and to the success of the mission. The spaceflight risk associated with muscle atrophy is impaired performance due to reduced muscle mass, strength and endurance. Risks of early onset of osteoporosis and bone fracture are among the spaceflight risks associated with loss of bone mineral density. METHODS: Tools under development include a neuromuscular model, a biomechanical model and a bone remodeling model. The neuromuscular model will include models of neuromuscular drive, muscle atrophy, fiber morphology and metabolic processes as a function of time in space. Human movement will be modeled with the biomechanical model, using muscle and bone model parameters at various states. The bone remodeling model will allow analysis of bone turnover, loss and adaptation. A comprehensive trade study was completed to identify the current state of the art in musculoskeletal modeling. The DAP musculoskeletal models will be developed using a combination of existing commercial software and academic research codes identified in the study, which will be modified for use in human spaceflight research. These individual models are highly dependent upon each other and will be integrated together once they reach sufficient levels of maturity. ANALYSES: The analyses performed with these models will include comparison of different countermeasure exercises for optimizing effectiveness and comparison of task requirements and the state of strength and endurance of a crew member at a particular time in a mission. DISCUSSION: The DAP musculoskeletal model has the potential to complement research conducted on spaceflight induced changes to the musculoskeletal system. It can help with hypothesis formation, identification of causative mechanisms and supplementing small data samples.","[{""submissionId"":20110011357,""id"":""32adcc3f827c446891b144a406e3c7d6"",""publicationDate"":""2011-04-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""WBS 516724.02.02.03""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110011357

The techniques used to assess requirement conformance and test-to-test engine health and performance pose many unique challenges including the unusually large scale of data, complex component and system analysis, and rigorous engineering judgement standards. To address these challenges, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center’s Engine Systems branch has developed and maintained a robust software suite and operational processes that satisfy programmatic requirements levied on engines and the 7 Elements of Flight Rationale. Analysis at a systems level includes subsystem assessment of components such as turbomachinery and combustion devices as well as structural and fluid dynamics and transient and steady-state assessment at a systems level. Some of the most important tools to accomplish this analysis are automated script databases, creation of historical and statistical comparisons, and parameters calculated at the full data rate.

Because nutrients are required for the structure and function of every cell and every system in the body, defining the nutrient requirements for spaceflight and ensuring provision and intake of those nutrients are primary issues for crew health and mission success. Unique aspects of nutrition during space travel include the overarching physiological adaptation to weightlessness, psychological adaptation to extreme and remote environments, and the ability of nutrition and nutrients to serve as countermeasures to ameliorate the negative effects of spaceflight on the human body. Key areas of clinical concern for long-duration spaceflight include loss of body mass (general inadequate food intake), bone and muscle loss, cardiovascular and immune system decrements, increased radiation exposure and oxidative stress, vision and ophthalmic changes, behavior and performance, nutrient supply during extravehicular activity, and general depletion of body nutrient stores because of inadequate food supply, inadequate food intake, increased metabolism, and/or irreversible loss of nutrients.

For humans, these harmful environmental factors have been known to cause negative health impacts such as immune dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceflight impacts human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately assessing the risks associated with spaceflight, but also for developing effective countermeasures. This study is part of the Functional Immune Project, intended to determine alterations in crewmembers` immunobiology before, during, and after spaceflight. For this project, blood samples were collected from International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers at the following time points: i) Blood was drawn at two pre-flight time points of 180 days (L180) and 45 days (L45) before launch. ii) During flight, blood was drawn at approximately the midpoint (mid-flight, MF) of the mission, and shortly before egress from the ISS (late-flight, LF). iii) Post-flight blood samples were collected within 36 hours (R0), 30 days (R30) and 90 days (R90) after landing. For each crewmember, blood was also drawn from a matching test subject on the ground at the corresponding time point. For both the ISS crewmembers and the ground control subjects, total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and mRNA was analysed using next generation RNA-sequencing (NGS). Differentially expressed genes were determined by performing contrast analysis. Using the ground control subjects of all time points combined as a control, a number of dysregulated genes were identified in astronauts at MF, LF and R0, including downregulations of SMAD7 and CDKN1A at MF and LF. Some of the genes such as SERPINE1 and VEGFA were downregulated at MF and LF, but upregulated at R0, while others such as NKG7 were down regulated at all 3 time points. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated that the NF-κB pathway was chronically activated in space. Analysis of the consequent diseases suggested potential associations with not only immune dysfunction, but also other health risks including osteoarthritis, cardiac hypertrophy and neuroinflammation.

Yet on-board care, response to unexpected medical events, and management of communication delays and dropouts will increasingly become the purview of the crew for primary management.","[{""submissionId"":20240002454,""publisher"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""id"":""845aa7eeaf8d442ba0f079df3cc4637c"",""publicationDate"":""2024-02-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Lunar and Planetary Science and Exploration"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240002454
20140003758,ABSTRACT,Effects of Long Duration Spaceflight on Venous and Arterial Compliance,"[""Ribeiro, L. C."",""Lee, S. M. C."",""Martin, D. S."",""Ploutz-Snyder, R."",""Stenger, M. B."",""Westby, C. M."",""Platts, S. H.""]","The visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome (VIIP) is a newly described space flight-associated medical condition made up of a constellation of symptoms affecting at least 34% of American astronauts who have flown International Space Station (ISS) missions. VIIP is defined primarily by visual acuity deficits and anatomical changes to eye structures, and is thought to be related to elevated intracranial pressure secondary to space flightinduced cephalad fluid shifts. Loss of visual acuity could be a significant threat to crew health and performance and may be suggestive of other adaptations with implications for years post-flight. Our primary objective is to determine whether vascular compliance is altered by space flight and whether such adaptations are related to the incidence of VIIP. In particular, we will measure ocular parameters and vascular compliance in vessels of the head and neck in astronauts who have no space flight experience, in astronauts before, during, and after space flight, and in bed rest subjects with conditions similar to space flight. Additionally, we will analyze astronaut data from the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health (LSAH) archive to determine which factors might be predictive of the development of VIIP. The project will be conducted in four separate but related parts. To understand the baseline condition of astronauts without any prior space flight experience, we will study 10 astronauts who have never flown in space by performing a comprehensive evaluation of the vasculature of the head, neck and eyes. Hemodynamic data (stroke volume and blood pressure), ocular (tonometry and ocular ultrasound), venous and arterial parameters will be acquired across a range of tilt angles (20, 10, 0, -10, -20 degrees). Vessels to be studied include the temporal, jugular, and vertebral veins and the cerebral, carotid and vertebral arteries. Ophthalmic data from the annual physical will be obtained through data sharing. To examine the relation between vascular compliance in the head and neck and the development of VIIP after a long duration space flight, we will study 10 astronauts before, during, and after long-duration ISS missions. Pre- and post-flight testing will be identical to that described above. During flight, images of the same vessels of interest will be obtained for later analysis. Ophthalmic data including VIIP scores will be obtained through data sharing from medically-required tests. To investigate the effects of age and elevated sodium intake, two potential contributors to VIIP, we will study 24 men (in two age groups: 25-35 and 45-55) during a 14 day 6deg head-down bed rest, a well-accepted analog of space flight. Standard NASA bed rest conditions will be maintained except for dietary sodium. Sodium intake will be similar to that of ISS astronauts, which is higher than consumed in previous bed rest studies. Pre- and post-bed rest testing procedures will be identical to the testing protocol described above for astronauts. Ophthalmic testing (optical coherence tomography, fundoscopy, and tonometry) will be conducted on the same day that vascular compliance measures are obtained. To identify parameters that may relate to an increase in an astronaut's susceptibility to developing VIIP, we will use data mining techniques to evaluate astronaut data obtained from the LSAH. Medical history, family history, space flight history and its related exposures, and history of high performance jet aircraft exposure will be examined for their potential relationship to ocular data. We hypothesize that the cephalad fluid shift induced by space flight will result in structural and functional adaptations in head and neck vessels leading to decreased vascular compliance and related to the development of VIIP symptoms. Further, although VIIP has not been observed in previous bed rest studies, we hypothesize that an elevated sodium intake will increase the incidence of VIIP symptoms in this space flight analog. Finally, we hypothesize that data mining analyses will reveal relationships between health history, previous exposures (including space flight and high performance aircraft), and the development of VIIP in the astronaut population.","[{""submissionId"":20140003758,""id"":""5b5485ff29de4d7ab4745603980cc6fa"",""publicationDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140003758,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""670df69c7ee14f9aba78e08119297c14""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140003758,""endDate"":""2014-02-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""8ccaff322ecb48d2811364bf91d9f59d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9c6bee6f49a54fbdae6c3737a8a38e29"",""id"":""b3c2cc9ce521483c9dbbeba298446c8f""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9c6bee6f49a54fbdae6c3737a8a38e29"",""id"":""14ae1cf1c5f74adaaa74039038037a90""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""9c6bee6f49a54fbdae6c3737a8a38e29"",""startDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140003758

The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and future exploration missions are mass constrained; therefore the team is challenged to reduce the mass of the food system by 10% while maintaining product safety, nutrition, and acceptability. Commercially available products do not meet the nutritional requirements for a full meal replacement in the spaceflight food system, and it is currently unknown if daily meal replacements will impact crew food intake and psychosocial health over time. The purpose of this study was to develop a variety of nutritionally balanced breakfast replacement bars that meet spaceflight nutritional, microbiological, sensorial, and shelf-life requirements, while enabling a 10% savings in food mass. To date, six nutrient-dense meal replacement bars (approximately 700 calories per bar) have been developed, using traditional methods of compression as well as novel ultrasonic compression technologies developed by Creative Resonance Inc. (Phoenix, AZ). The four highest rated bars were evaluated in the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) to assess the frequency with which actual meal replacement options may be implemented. Specifically, overall impact of bars on mood, satiety, digestive discomfort, and satisfaction with food. These factors are currently being analyzed to inform successful implementation strategies where crew maintain adequate food intake. In addition, these bars are currently undergoing shelf-life testing to determine long-term sensory acceptability, nutritional stability, qualitative stability of analytical measurements (i.e. water activity and texture), and microbiological compliance over two years of storage at room temperature and potential temperature abuse conditions to predict long-term acceptability. It is expected that this work will enable a successful meal replacement strategy to be implemented that will maintain crew food consumption and health, while informing exploration missions with appropriate mass savings expectations.","[{""submissionId"":20160012786,""id"":""b544bdb5cd114211a517239239603223"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160012786,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""b22159def3a848228771ea43986687c5""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160012786,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""5e263e09d52345b492a05638c1dcf696"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""fa07c8bc889e44288984dcdc0013f82b"",""id"":""6ca58eeea5cf4ada89e13c5b0cf8bb9c""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst.

20160013685,ABSTRACT,Cardiovascular Disease Risk in NASA Astronauts Across the Lifespan: Historical Cohort Studies,"[""Charvat, Jacqueline M."",""Lee, Stuart M. C."",""Davenport, Eddie"",""Barlow, Carolyn E."",""Radford, Nina B."",""De Fina, Laura F."",""Stenger, Michael B."",""Van Baalen, Mary""]","Acute effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system have been studied extensively, but the combined chronic effects of spaceflight and aging are not well understood. Preparation for and participation in space flight activities are potentially associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors (e.g., altered dietary and exercise habits, physical and emotional stress, circadian shifts, radiation). Further, astronauts who travel into space multiple times may be at an increased risk across their lifespan. However, comparing the risk of cardiovascular disease in astronauts to other large cohorts is difficult. For example, comparisons between astronauts and large national cohorts, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Health Information Survey, are hampered by significant differences in health status between astronauts and the general population, and most of these national studies fail to provide longitudinal data on population health. To address those limitations, NASA's Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health previously sought to compare the astronauts to a cohort of civil servants employed at the Johnson Space Center. However, differences between the astronauts and civil servants at the beginning of the study, as well as differential follow up, limited the ability to interpret the results. To resolve some of these limitations, two unique cohorts of healthy workers, U.S. Air Force aviators and Cooper Center Longitudinal Study participants, have been identified as potential comparison populations for the astronaut corps. The Air Force cohort was chosen due to similarities in health at selection, screening, and some occupational exposures that Air Force aviators endure, many of which mirror that of the astronaut corps. The Cooper Clinic cohort, a generally healthy prevention cohort, was chosen for the vast array of clinical cardiovascular measures collected in a longitudinal manner complementary to those collected on astronauts, for a large number of subjects since 1971. The purpose of this study is to understand the incidence of cardiovascular disease outcomes and risk factors in the astronaut corps and determine whether the rates of disease are different than these two cohorts. The research questions are: 1. Are there differences in the incidence of CVD outcomes (MI, revascularization, and stroke) between each cohort and the NASA Astronaut cohort? 2. Are there differences in the incidence of CVD risks (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, arrhythmias, and diabetes) between each cohort and the NASA Astronaut cohort? 3. Are there differences between each cohort and the NASA Astronaut cohort in how CVD risk factors (e.g., lipids, behaviors) change across time? Collectively, results from these studies will enhance our understanding of how cardiovascular disease outcomes and risk factors change across time in astronauts compared to other longitudinally-studied healthy cohorts and determine if there are interactions between or additive effects of the occupational health effects of spaceflight exposure and normal aging.","[{""submissionId"":20160013685,""id"":""8a82ac95a3944b9e9b4e623b782c1223"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160013685,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f7a2941514d3423f9b253afee7f1dbcb"",""id"":""128e976f9f1647b39c81fa4184ca3452""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigator''s Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""f7a2941514d3423f9b253afee7f1dbcb"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160013685

These challenges include examining interdisciplinary space life science research across experiments and across interacting spaceflight hazards (radiation, altered gravity, confinement, hostile-closed environments, distance-duration from Earth).  The approaches to confront these challenges involve mining multiple datasets simultaneously from various hierarchical organizations of biological complexity, all while concurrently evaluating how experimental design factors affect endpoints of standard assays.  To enable this field, it is essential that principal investigators (PIs) submit data in a structure so it can be maximally re-used.  

The purpose of the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) is to collect, curate, and make publicly available all non-human space-relevant biological data.  ALSDA must also ensure data are open-access, and maximally findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).  The scope of ALSDA data collected and submitted by PIs include subject and study design metadata, assay metadata parameters, raw and processed assay data, assay imagery/video, and subject-experienced mission data telemetry (radiation, temperature, humidity, acoustics, vibrations, etc.).  ALSDA recently integrated into a collaborative group of Open Science projects to facilitate a suite of new tools and workflows that will improve data submission, accessibility, and reusability by implementing digital data submission agreements, and adopting the data management system originally developed by NASA GeneLab.  ALSDA intends to bring current biological repository data and all future collected data into this new scientific data reuse reality.

This new suite of tools will enable ALSDA to deploy a science curation system using scientific assay configurations for the data submission portal.  It will capture essential assay parameters according to established standards in each sub-field within biology.  The submission portal expedites data collection by enhancing ease of PI data submission, providing a user interface and specificity for which data is to be submitted.  Data submissions can be brought into cutting-edge informatic analysis portals to enable mining of physiological, behavioral, biochemical, and imaging datasets in conjunction with ‘omics-level datasets.  As ALSDA datasets are submitted, curated, and published (e.g., micro-computed tomography, histology, pulse oximetry, serum metabolites, magnetic resonance imaging, intraocular pressure, novel object recognition, etc.), the merging together of spaceflight data along this multi-hierarchical complexity of biology will enable informatics and data-intensive approaches resulting in knowledge discoveries across missions, space hazards, and biological disciplines.

New updates to the Data Management Plan in 2023 include 

1.	CAPABILITIES AND SERVICES
Data Repositories.   Principal Investigators (PIs) funded by HRP may be asked to submit data to one of several NASA data repositories.  HRP archives data in the NASA Life Sciences Portal (NLSP) that it considers to be unique and high value. This includes data from human subjects in space flight (ISS and commercial flights) and ground analogs to spaceflight; spaceflight tech demos involving humans; human omics data including the microbiome; parabolic flight studies; and the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL).   The Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) includes The Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA), used to archive non-human biological data (e.g., animal) generated by the Human Research program, and GeneLab, available to HRP PIs to archive non-human omics data.
Catalog for search and retrieval. A catalog of non-human HRP life science experiments, with all associated descriptions (mission, payload, hardware, and personnel related information), and biospecimens is provided on the NLSP public web site for search and retrieval. 

2.	 IRB ROLE IN RETURN OF INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH RESULTS
The NASA IRB manages the process for incidental findings and for returning results to subjects for studies for which NASA IRB is the IRB of record.  Omics data, especially genomics data, may generate information significant to the health of or risk to a research subject.  These data potentially hold the keys to understand lifetime risks of chronic diseases, such as cancer, as well as risks associated with exposures common in space flight.

3.	UPDATE OF TERMS – IDENTIFIABLE AND ATTRIBUTABLE DATA
HRP now follows Federal and NASA policy by using “identifiable” instead of “attributable” for Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

4.	POLICY ABOUT INTERNAL NON-RESEARCH USE OF DATA
The HRP Chief Scientist grants access to data from HRP-funded research for non-research internal use that includes program management, customer facilitation, strategic planning, and risk research planning.  Typical HRP personnel granted access to HRP research data for internal use include the Element Scientist, Subject Matter Experts (SME), and Data/bioinformatics Scientists. If data accessed for Internal Use is provided to an intramural or extramural scientist for hypothesis driven research, all Federal and NASA regulations (e.g., IRB review) regarding human subject research apply.

20240002812,ABSTRACT,Optimizing Postural Control Assessment in Astronauts and Head-Down Bedrest Subjects ,"[""H E Gustafson"",""S C Moudy"",""T R Macaulay"",""Scott J Wood""]","In space, astronauts undergo physiological adaptations, such as changes in sensorimotor processing, to acclimate to microgravity conditions. However, these adaptations pose challenges upon astronauts’ return to Earth, particularly in postural control. Astronauts struggle with balance and coordination during the early post-flight period. Understanding these adaptations and their implications is key for optimizing astronaut health and performance, especially in anticipation of upcoming Artemis lunar missions. Head-down bedrest (HDBR) is a ground-based spaceflight analog that allows for additional research to be conducted into this adaptation and recovery period to test potential countermeasures before spaceflight. This research aims to delve into the assessment of postural control in both HDBR subjects and astronauts, providing insights essential for mission preparedness and the development of effective countermeasures.","[{""volume"":"""",""submissionId"":20240002812,""issue"":"""",""issn"":"""",""isbn"":"""",""eissn"":"""",""id"":""f0f69978e04041ed8b322a90d0f40350"",""eisbn"":"""",""publicationName"":"""",""url"":"""",""doi"":""""}]","[{""country"":""GB"",""submissionId"":20240002812,""endDate"":""2024-09-06T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""44deed022d9146629d971b39f7eef274"",""id"":""1b4bd34e46eb4b529faf40720986a04c""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Human Research Program ""}},""meetingId"":""44deed022d9146629d971b39f7eef274"",""id"":""165390192f2f4556ae4406edcad9d101""}],""name"":""European Low Gravity Research Association Symposium"",""location"":""Liverpool"",""id"":""44deed022d9146629d971b39f7eef274"",""url"":""https://www.elgra.org/elgra-2024-symposium/"",""startDate"":""2024-09-03T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.03.07.93.1605""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240002812

20230015831,PRESENTATION,Exploration Medical Capability - Advancing Medical System Design and Risk-Informed Decision Making for Deep Space Exploration,"[""Kris Lehnhardt"",""Nancy Fleming"",""Jay Lemery"",""Andrea Marchica"",""Ben Easter""]","BACKGROUND: Within NASA’s Human Research Program, the Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element has three primary focus areas: clinical and scientific research, systems engineering and trade space analysis, and technology development and demonstrations. These focus areas feed into the overarching goal of enabling progressively Earth-Independent Medical Operations (EIMO), a new paradigm that will be necessary for future Artemis and Mars medical and vehicle systems. This EIMO end state aligns with NASA’s Moon to Mars Objectives, which clearly outline the need for NASA deep space exploration missions to reduce their reliance upon Earth and become increasingly autonomous, in preparation for the first human Mars mission.

OVERVIEW: To advance exploration medical systems and ultimately, integrated crew health and performance systems, ExMC’s portfolio includes: funding ground development & testing of novel medical capabilities; creation of new approaches for the development of medical protocols and procedures; deployment of innovative technologies into analog environments; technology demonstrations in spaceflight; and eventual transition to operations of new capabilities for deep space exploration missions. The portfolio also includes: pharmaceutical research targeting stability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics; integrated data architectures and clinical decision support tools; and systems engineering and trade space analysis tools to assist NASA in the development of future medical system models as well as the medical system requirements that can serve as a foundation for deep space exploration missions. All of these investments are done in a collaborative and coordinated fashion with other NASA stakeholders, such as the Environmental Control and Life Support Systems – Crew Health and Performance System Capability Leadership Team and the Health and Medical Technical Authority.

DISCUSSION: In this presentation, ExMC will provide an overview of our work from across our portfolio, all of which will inform future EIMO efforts at NASA. ExMC’s research and development investments are targeted to reduce the human system risks associated with deep space exploration to the Moon and Mars.

The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and future exploration missions are mass constrained; therefore we are challenged to reduce the mass of the food system by 10% while maintaining safety, nutrition, and acceptability for exploration missions. Food bars have previously been used to supplement meals in the Skylab food system, indicating that regular consumption of bars will be acceptable. However, commercially available products do not meet the requirements for a full meal replacement in the spaceflight food system. The purpose of this task is to develop a variety of nutritionally balanced breakfast replacement bars, which meet spaceflight nutritional, microbiological, sensorial, and shelf-life requirements, while enabling a 10% food mass savings. To date, six nutrient-dense meal replacement bars have been developed, using both traditional methods of compression as well as novel ultrasonic compression technologies developed by Creative Resonance Inc. (Phoenix, AZ). All bars will be prioritized based on acceptability and the four top candidates will be evaluated in the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) to assess the frequency with which actual meal replacement options may be implemented. Specifically, overall impact to mood, satiety, dietary discomfort, and satisfaction with food will be analyzed to inform successful implementation strategies. In addition, these bars will be evaluated based on final product sensory acceptability, nutritional stability, qualitative stability of analytical measurements (i.e. water activity and texture), and microbiological compliance over two years of storage at room temperature and potential temperature abuse conditions to predict long-term acceptability. It is expected that this work will enable a successful meal replacement strategy to be implemented that maintains crew food consumption and health, while informing exploration missions with appropriate mass savings expectations.","[{""submissionId"":20150022307,""id"":""63ed3a862dbc4a449bd6b4047afef42c"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150022307,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f26a1ceff8f34b55a5f49b3ff153fc61"",""id"":""e03686de2ccf4dec9cf02428c7e920dc""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2016)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""f26a1ceff8f34b55a5f49b3ff153fc61"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]","[{""id"":20160012376,""title"":""Meal Replacement Mass Reduction and Integration Acceptability Study""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150022307

In addition, there are limited clinical and research data to inform development and implementation of health risk countermeasures for these missions. Consequently, NASA's Digital Astronaut Project (DAP) is working to develop and implement computational models and simulations (M&S) to help predict and assess spaceflight health and performance risks, and enhance countermeasure development. In order to effectively accomplish these goals, the DAP evaluates its models and simulations via a rigorous verification, validation and credibility assessment process to ensure that the computational tools are sufficiently reliable to both inform research intended to mitigate potential risk as well as guide countermeasure development. In doing so, DAP works closely with end-users, such as space life science researchers, to establish appropriate M&S credibility thresholds. We will present and demonstrate the process the DAP uses to vet computational M&S for space biomedical analysis using real M&S examples. We will also provide recommendations on how the larger space biomedical community can employ these concepts to enhance the credibility of their M&S codes.","[{""submissionId"":20140017017,""id"":""abe855cb1a044786a2af868eb3d3df02"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140017017,""endDate"":""2015-07-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""3194431060294fa1969c379e78d001a2"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Texas Tech Univ."",""location"":""Lubbock, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""a47b57a51ae74264b8a004a28012922a"",""id"":""fb0885126bd54007b2076af777e6f15c""},{""organizationId"":""9381b76034b1432b8f4124cf06b3d774"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""UTC Aerospace Systems"",""location"":""Charlotte, NC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""a47b57a51ae74264b8a004a28012922a"",""id"":""bfda9359c1654bdbb12d248a0e5a4405""},{""organizationId"":""acaa37f260ec4a3c98804ba419da8e15"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Paragon Space Development Corp."",""location"":""Tucson, AZ, United States""}},""meetingId"":""a47b57a51ae74264b8a004a28012922a"",""id"":""ad11af4d5b6d491ba8a811533b586ae9""}],""name"":""International Conference on Environmental Systems (ICES 2015)"",""location"":""Bellevue, WA"",""id"":""a47b57a51ae74264b8a004a28012922a"",""startDate"":""2015-07-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Computer Programming And Software"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140017017

These challenges include the individual and combined effects of microgravity, radiation exposure, isolation, limited resources (mass, volume, power, data and crew time), limited options for evacuation and those associated with delayed or constrained communications, all of which demand greater crew autonomy.  Specifically, as the communication delays intensify the further we explore space, the unqualified need for Earth-independent medical operations focused on autonomous diagnosis, treatment and prevention will be key to mission continuation and success.  To augment the requisite knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) of a time-constrained crew operating under stressful conditions, combatting fatigue, and facing a potential medical crisis, a robust clinical decision support system (CDSS) is a probable solution that would facilitate, guide and inform Earth-independent medical operations, while assisting crewmembers through various clinical presentations.  The Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element of the Human Research Program (HRP) is expanding the boundaries of space medical systems to advance the care of astronauts on future exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit.  ExMC is actively identifying and testing next-generation medical care and crew health maintenance technologies.  The Clinical Decision Support (CDS) project addresses gap Medical-701 within the Inflight Medical Conditions risk:  “Enhance medical capabilities within an exploration medical system.”  Though mass, volume, and power will face increasing constraints, the projected computational capabilities of spacecraft systems will increase exponentially as information technology continues to advance this decade and beyond.  Hence, data, software and computational resources will play an essential and synergistic role in maintaining crew health, wellness and performance in deep space missions.

The focus of the CDS project is to develop recommended requirements for an in-vehicle CDSS that acts as a ‘virtual assistant’ for delivering optimal health, performance and medical care during exploration missions.  The CDSS is envisioned as an integrated, software-based tool deployed on a laptop computer or handheld device. The CDSS will assist the crew and ground support when interacting with knowledge/databases (e.g. records, pharmacy, schedule), instrumentation (e.g. imaging, physiological monitoring devices), and habitat (e.g. wellness system, task performance system) and vehicle systems (e.g. environmental system, communication system).  In addition, the human interface will employ a context-based approach that accounts for the crew’s situation.  Thus, extraneous and clinically/operationally non-relevant information are reduced to avoid an increase in cognitive load.  The framework of an ideal spaceflight CDSS is to include core and advanced analytical features that incorporate work from collaborators yet maintain a flexible platform for integrating new technology in the future.  

In fiscal year 2021 (FY21), the CDS project identified requirements through two primary mechanisms: (i) the development of software implementation prototypes and (ii) the application of systems engineering processes.  The CDS project developed and tested a series of increasingly complex system prototypes that were based on use cases derived from the CDSS concept of operations (ConOps).  These software implementations yielded insights on CDSS functionality as well as lessons learned that provided the initial requirements for CDSS capability.  By applying a systems engineering (SE) approach, medical scenarios provided in the ConOps and the use cases for software implementation underwent functional decomposition to identify CDSS functionality.  Also, systems-based modeling language (SysML) tools such as activity diagrams were developed from the same ConOps and use cases to identify CDSS functionality.  The lessons learned from software implementation defined both specific requirements and broad areas of requirements.  Within these defined broad requirement areas, further analysis of the SE products identified specific capability that resulted in the final functional requirements.  In summary, the software prototypes, functional decomposition of the ConOps and use cases, and SysML diagrams provided the basis for the CDSS requirements developed in FY21.  In the upcoming year, these requirements will be refined for their final ExMC baseline review in latter FY22.

System (VEG-04A, VEG-04B, and VEG-05) is a set of translational experiments with plant research
combined with human sensory and behavioral research. Considerable ground research was conducted to
develop and support protocols that were tested in flight. The VEG-04 flight experiments conducted in 2019 
consisted of growing Mizuna mustard under different lighting spectra, with the first experiment harvesting 
plants at a single time point and the second using a cut-and-come-again repetitive harvest approach. VEG-05 
was conducted on ISS Dec. 2022 through March 2023, growing ‘Red Robin’ dwarf tomatoes under the same 
lighting spectra. In addition to understanding plant growth, development, and produce yields under different 
lighting conditions, goals for VEG-04/05 were to understand microbial food safety and develop safe handling 
practices for crops grown in Veggie. The human-specific foci of this project included collecting data on 
behavioral health and performance aspects of crops and crop care and assessing sensory acceptability of the 
consumed crops. Crew were able to consume produce and conduct sensory evaluations for the produce of the 
VEG-04 studies, although due to challenges maintaining adequate moisture for plants during growth of the 
VEG-05 tomatoes, insufficient fruit were formed for crew consumption. For VEG-05, plant samples were 
taken to conduct microbiome and transcriptomic evaluation, as well as the planned food safety assessment 
and elemental analysis. Key takeaways from the VEG-04/05 experiments, coupled with other data collected 
from earlier Veggie crop testing, indicate that crop yield is similar between ground and flight when plants are 
not stressed. Maintaining plants in a manually watered system such as Veggie is challenging, especially over 
long durations, and it is hard to avoid water-related stresses. Some differences between ground and flight plant 
nutrient content have been shown, but these are not consistent between species or experiments and are 
influenced by experiment timing, crop type, harvest scenario, and other environmental conditions. Microbial 
counts and compositions vary between flight and ground plants, and microbes typical of the space station 
environment are often associated with ISS-grown plants. Human pathogens are rarely identified on spacegrown plants and have only been found below levels of concern to human health. The only human pathogens 
identified in Veggie-grown crops were S. aureus in one plant in the VEG-04B experiment at very low levels.
The safe handling practice approach seems effective at keeping space plant products safe for human 
consumption. Microbial communities vary between shoot/fruit, and root/adventitious root tissues in tomato, 
and between shoot and root tissues in other experiments. Generally, there is greater microbial diversity and 
higher culturable counts in aerial microbiomes of ISS-grown plants, compared with those grown on the ground.
Transcriptomic data for tomato leaves and adventitious roots indicate differences in response to light, with the 
blue-rich-lit plants showing higher percentages of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than do red-richgrown plants. DEGs separate based on tissue type but overlap based on the plant growth environment (flight 
and ground). Biological processes related to differential gene expression are being characterized, and there are 
some differences between light treatments and environment in those, but stress processes are strongly
indicated, especially in adventitious roots, which were much more pronounced in flight-grown plants. VEG04/05 data indicate that astronauts enjoy growing and eating plants in spaceflight in general. Overall, plants 
adapt well to the space environment, and this project demonstrates the potential for space-grown crops. In 
order to increase the integration of crops in spaceflight, further work is needed on crop selection, hardware,

These countermeasure protocols should use the fewest crew and vehicle resources. NASA s Exercise Physiology and Countermeasures (ExPC) Project works to identify, collect, interpret, and summarize evidence that results in effective exercise countermeasure protocols which protect crew health and performance during International Space Station (ISS) and future exploration-class missions. The ExPC and NASA s Human Research Program are sponsoring multiple studies to evaluate and improve the efficacy of spaceflight exercise countermeasures. First, the Project will measure maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) during cycle ergometry before, during, and after ISS missions. Second, the Project is sponsoring an evaluation of a new prototype harness that offers improved comfort and increased loading during treadmill operations. Third, the Functional Tasks Test protocol will map performance of anticipated lunar mission tasks with physiologic systems before and after short and long-duration spaceflight, to target system contributions and the tailoring of exercise protocols to maximize performance. In addition to these studies that are actively enrolling crewmember participants, the ExPC is planning new studies that include an evaluation of a higher-intensity/lower-volume exercise countermeasure protocol aboard the ISS using the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device and second-generation treadmill, studies that evaluate bone loading during spaceflight exercise, and ground-based studies that focus on fitness for duty standards required to complete lunar mission tasks and for which exercise protocols need to protect. Summaries of these current and future studies and strategies will be provided to international colleagues for knowledge sharing and possible collaboration.","[{""submissionId"":20090032646,""id"":""f138d5321bd646178bfa17cd9383b0e9"",""publicationDate"":""2009-06-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20090032646,""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Paris, France"",""id"":""f7855d80580240f3bd5b2de8ca09f466""},{""country"":""Russia"",""submissionId"":20090032646,""endDate"":""2009-06-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""4e27d16fe02c4731a702d39eb7e32cc2"",""id"":""15c97630688c441989fe2354091d3236""}],""name"":""17th IAA Humans in Space Symposium"",""location"":""Moscow"",""id"":""4e27d16fe02c4731a702d39eb7e32cc2"",""startDate"":""2009-06-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090032646

L.""]","The addition of probiotic bacteria to the space food system is expected to confer immunostimulatory benefits on crewmembers during spaceflight, counteracting the immune dysregulation that has been documented in spaceflight [1]. Specifically, the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus has been shown to promote health benefits including antagonism towards and inhibition of virulence related gene expression in pathogens, mucosal stimulation of immune cells, and a reduction in the occurrence and duration of cold and flu-like symptoms [2-5]. The optimum delivery system for probiotics has not been determined for spaceflight, where the food system is shelf stable and the lack of refrigeration prevents the use of traditional dairy delivery methods. This work proposes to determine whether L. acidophilus is more viable, and therefore more likely to confer immune benefit, when delivered in a capsule form or when delivered in nonfat dry milk powder with a resuscitation opportunity upon rehydration, following 0, 4, and 8 months of storage at -80degC, 4degC, and 22degC, and both prior to and after challenge with simulated gastric and intestinal juices. We hypothesize that the low moisture neutral dairy matrix provided by the nonfat dry milk, and the rehydration step prior to consumption, will extend probiotic viability and stress tolerance compared to a capsule during potential storage conditions in spaceflight and in simulated digestion conditions.","[{""submissionId"":20140005954,""id"":""31d0704b8b6346c7930faea3deabd089"",""publicationDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140005954,""endDate"":""2014-02-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""ab90b6af5edb45c397a8387bc2e376ed"",""startDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20140006561,""title"":""Delivery of Probiotics in the Space Food System""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140005954
20160008094,ABSTRACT,Designing for Reliability and Robustness,"[""Svetlik, Randall G."",""Moore, Cherice"",""Williams, Antony""]","Long duration spaceflight has a negative effect on the human body, and exercise countermeasures are used on-board the International Space Station (ISS) to minimize bone and muscle loss, combatting these effects. Given the importance of these hardware systems to the health of the crew, this equipment must continue to be readily available. Designing spaceflight exercise hardware to meet high reliability and availability standards has proven to be challenging throughout the time the crewmembers have been living on ISS beginning in 2000. Furthermore, restoring operational capability after a failure is clearly time-critical, but can be problematic given the challenges of troubleshooting the problem from 220 miles away. Several best-practices have been leveraged in seeking to maximize availability of these exercise systems, including designing for robustness, implementing diagnostic instrumentation, relying on user feedback, and providing ample maintenance and sparing. These factors have enhanced the reliability of hardware systems, and therefore have contributed to keeping the crewmembers healthy upon return to Earth. This paper will review the failure history for three spaceflight exercise countermeasure systems identifying lessons learned that can help improve future systems. Specifically, the Treadmill with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization System (TVIS), Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization System (CEVIS), and the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) will be reviewed, analyzed, and conclusions identified so as to provide guidance for improving future exercise hardware designs. These lessons learned, paired with thorough testing, offer a path towards reduced system down-time.

Astronauts experience postflight disturbances in postural and locomotor control due to sensorimotor adaptations during spaceflight. These alterations may have adverse consequences if a rapid egress is required after landing. Although exercise is partially effective for mitigating cardiovascular and muscular deconditioning, additional countermeasures are needed to further preserve sensorimotor function for exploration missions. We have identified proprioceptive training and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) as promising in-flight countermeasures. Since prolonged head down bed rest (HDBR) is a spaceflight analog for body unloading and causes postural and locomotor control decrements that parallel those observed after spaceflight, it can be used to facilitate the development of these countermeasures.  

METHODS
This study will determine the effects of proprioceptive training and EMS on functional task performance and sensorimotor function following 60 days of 6° HDBR. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1)an EMS arm, 2) a proprioceptive training arm, 3) an exercise plus proprioceptive training arm, and 4) a control arm. The EMS countermeasure will include daily bilateral stimulation of selected bilateral lower extremity muscles (30 minutes per session). Proprioceptive training will be performed three days per week (20 minutes per session) consisting of body-loaded postural tasks in the horizontal position on an air bearing sled. Exercise training will mimic current protocols used on the International Space Station, but treadmill aerobic exercise will be replaced with additional cycling aerobic exercise. Primary outcome measures will include pre and post HDBR functional tests that are representative of high priority exploration mission tasks and require high demand for dynamic control of postural stability. Additional measures will be used to identify the key physiological factors contributing to countermeasure benefits. Given the constrained samples size, a Bayesian modelling approach will be used to quantify the probability that there is an effect of a given magnitude. 

HARDWARE AND PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT
Proprioceptive countermeasure design enhancements continued as part of the Mars Campaign Office (MCO) Crew Health and Performance (CHP) Crew Health Countermeasures (CHC). The primary goals of this work were to assemble a portable version of the countermeasure system that can be used at the :envihab facility, expand the software feedback system’s capabilities, and develop an actuator loading system that mimics what could be used on the International Space Station. In addition, one major piece of exercise hardware used in previous HDBR studies, the Horizontal Squat Device, was reassembled and restored to full functionality. Human-in-the-loop pilot testing is ongoing, prior to shipping both devices to the :envihab HDBR facility. Evaluations are also underway for the best EMS device technologies and specific methods. Finally, assessment techniques are being translated for administration in the horizontal position (e.g., leg dexterity and foot sole skin sensitivity). Our current goals are to refine the countermeasure training and assessment techniques and integrate protocols across multiple modalities. 
 
RELEVANCE
The deliverable from this project will be proof-of-concept sensorimotor countermeasure designs for functional task performance with full assessment of efficacy in a spaceflight analog. If one or more countermeasures are effective, they will be translated for validation with the suite of operationally implemented in-flight countermeasures.

Romeyn"",""LaShelle E. Spencer"",""Raymond M. Wheeler""]","Growing fresh, nutritious, palatable produce for crew consumption during spaceflight may provide health-promoting, bioavailable nutrients and enhance the astronaut dietary experience as we move toward longer-duration missions.  Tending plants may also serve as a countermeasure for crew psychological stresses associated with spaceflight.  However, requirements to support consistent growth of a variety of nutritious crops under spaceflight environmental conditions remain unclear.  This study explores the potential to grow crops for consumption on the International Space Station (ISS) using the Veggie vegetable-production system.  Mizuna mustard was grown during VEG-04 studies in 2019, and human and plant data from those tests continue to be analyzed.  Tomato plants will be grown for the VEG-05 experiment, and preflight definition studies are underway to ascertain the best hardware and operations for growing this fruiting crop.  The variety of tomato selected for this study is ‘Red Robin’, a compact cherry tomato.  Plants will be grown under two different red: blue lighting treatments using the Veggie units on ISS, and the impact of spectral quality on plant growth and yield, nutrient content, organoleptic acceptability, and microbial composition of the tomatoes will be assessed.  Preliminary testing with this crop helped to identify responses to different analog types of growth hardware including both plant pillows and Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System (PONDS) units, and current testing is focusing on flight-like versions of this hardware.  Challenges with fertilizer salts leaching out into the plant wicks and burning the stems of tomato were observed in earlier tests, so amended fertilizer and wick configurations have been developed.  Crew procedures including plant thinning, watering, height adjustment with respect to lighting, and pollination are being validated.  VEG-05 will be the first test of tomato fruit production on ISS.  Lessons learned during preparation and implementation of the VEG-04 mizuna test for watering, and a separate ISS investigation with peppers (PH-04) in the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH)  in terms of fertilizer, plant wicks, and pollination, will be adapted for this experiment.

SIGNIFICANCE: ISS crewmembers training in Star City are at potential physical and occupational risk of trauma or dysbarism during nominal Soyuz training flow, requiring medical support from an on-duty aerospace medicine specialist. This support maintains human health and performance by preserving crewmember safety and well-being for mission success; sharing information regarding this operational model may contribute to advances in other areas of international, military, and civilian operational aerospace medicine.

20240011745,ABSTRACT,Measuring Unique Contextual Factors: Group Living Skills,"[""J C W Miller"",""L B Landon"",""S T Bell"",""P G Roma""]","<b>BACKGROUND</b>
The Human Factors and Behavioral Performance Exploration Measures (HFBP-EM) suite is a set of standardized measures used to assess behavioral health and performance risks related to future exploration-class space missions. During the HFBP-EM suite development, the importance of assessing unique contextual factors to understand the drivers of team dynamics was identified. Group living skills are a unique workplace skill which applies to those coworkers who live and work together. As mission lengths become longer, the line between work and non-work life may blur. Extreme living conditions such as spaceflight can result in increased stress over time, negatively impact mood and well-being, decrease team cohesion and increase conflict, deteriorate task performance, and potentially reduce mission success [1]. With no breaks in their isolated and confined environment possible, living with a messy, inconsiderate crewmember can add to the stress. Alternatively, crews with good group living skills may support one another, mitigating the negative effects of the extreme environment. There was no direct measure of group living skills. This work sought to fill this measurement gap and collect data related to group living in isolated, confined, extreme (ICE) environments.

<b>METHODS</b>
Group living skills as an astronaut competency area were developed with the input of experts familiar with ICE environments. Distinct aspects of this competency were reviewed and discussed by a NASA-invited group of spaceflight experts in 2015 to identify individual and team behavioral health and performance measures for operational environments. This work resulted in a 5-item measure focused on group living experiences with each crewmember (or the crew as a whole). A 6th item asks whether an individual would go on another mission with a particular crewmember or crew as a measure of future-oriented group living, or team viability. The measure was deployed in 24 teams living and working together in isolated and confined environments (e.g., International Space Station, space mission simulation analogs).

<b>RESULTS & DISCUSSION</b>
In this presentation, we will summarize results which indicate the Group Living Skills (GLS) Survey is a reliable, valid, and operationally feasible measure. Reliability was evaluated in several ways. Two-way multilevel mixed models revealed strong repeated measures reliability (ICC2 = .902, Omega between = .954). Reliability of change within teams was strong (Rc = .81). Factor analysis showed a consistent two-factor structure when individuals rated either the whole crew, all individuals, just peers, or a focal roommate. The latter used a sociometric approach to rating the GLS of the roommates. The two factors were tidiness and being considerate of others. We assessed the criterion-related validity of GLS, by examining GLS operationalized as the team-level aggregated GLS Survey scores as a predictor of team viability, team cohesion, and team performance. We used generalized mixed models to account for the repeated measures and longitudinal data. The marginal R2 change was used to determine the extent to which GLS were related to the team outcomes while controlling for mission day and campaign. Results suggested GLS was strongly related to team viability (marginal R2 change = .40), team cohesion (marginal R2 change = 0.28), social cohesion (marginal R2 change = 0.25), and moderately related to task cohesion (marginal R2 change = 0.18). GLS scores had a small relationship with team performance (marginal R2 change = .08). Results support GLS as a measure that can be used to capture group living skills of crews who live and work together in ICE. Because the items were written to be broadly applicable, less extreme environments with teams living and working together for some length of time also benefit from this measure (e.g., college roommates, camps). See Landon et al. (2024) for full results [2].

<b>SUMMARY</b>
We report reliability and validity evidence for a new measure that assesses the Group Living Skills for teams that live and work in operational environments such as spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":20240011745,""publisher"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""id"":""03ddc07dbd404b2dbbadc4c4a476b66a"",""publicationDate"":""2025-01-28T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240011745,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ba2f748c3c394a9caa537c7ba30303f9"",""id"":""e0e4bdf2ba8b438d8fbd272ff2b51e29""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""ba2f748c3c394a9caa537c7ba30303f9"",""url"":""https://www.nasa.gov/hrp-iws-2025/"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B"",""10449.2.03.08.22.0968""]",undefined,"[""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240011745

Tending plants may also serve as a countermeasure for crew psychological stresses associated with spaceflight.  However, requirements to support consistent growth of a variety of nutritious crops under spaceflight environmental conditions remain unclear.  This study explores the potential to grow crops for consumption on the International Space Station (ISS) using the Veggie vegetable-production system.  Mizuna mustard was grown during VEG-04 studies in 2019, and human and plant data from those tests continue to be analyzed.  Tomato plants will be grown for the VEG-05 experiment, and preflight definition studies are underway to ascertain the best hardware and operations for growing this fruiting crop.  The variety of tomato selected for this study is ‘Red Robin’, a compact cherry tomato.  Plants will be grown under two different red: blue lighting treatments using the Veggie units on ISS, and the impact of spectral quality on plant growth and yield, nutrient content, organoleptic acceptability, and microbial composition of the tomatoes will be assessed.  Preliminary testing with this crop helped to identify responses to different analog types of growth hardware including both plant pillows and Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System (PONDS) units, and current testing is focusing on flight-like versions of this hardware.  Challenges with fertilizer salts leaching out into the plant wicks and burning the stems of tomato were observed in earlier tests, so amended fertilizer and wick configurations have been developed.  Crew procedures including plant thinning, watering, height adjustment with respect to lighting, and pollination are being validated.  VEG-05 will be the first test of tomato fruit production on ISS.  Lessons learned during preparation and implementation of the VEG-04 mizuna test for watering, and a separate ISS investigation with peppers (PH-04) in the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH)  in terms of fertilizer, plant wicks, and pollination, will be adapted for this experiment.

Some elements of exploration may be safely and effectively performed by robots, but certain critical elements will require the trained, assertive, and reasoning mind of a human crewmember. To effectively use these skills, NASA needs a safe, effective, and efficient EVA component integrated into the human exploration program. The EVA preparation time should be minimized and the suit pressure should be low to accommodate EVA tasks without causing undue fatigue, physical discomfort, or suit-related trauma. Commissioned in 2005, the Exploration Atmospheres Working Group (EAWG) had the primary goal of recommending to NASA an internal environment that allowed efficient and repetitive EVAs for missions that were to be enabled by the former Constellation Program. At the conclusion of the EAWG meeting, the 8.0 psia and 32% oxygen (O2) environment were recommended for EVA-intensive phases of missions. After re-evaluation in 2012, the 8/32 environment was altered to 8.2 psia and 34% O2 to reduce the hypoxic stress to a crewmember. These two small changes increase alveolar O2 pressure by 11 mmHg, which is expected to significantly benefit crewmembers. The 8.2/34 environment (inspired O2 pressure = 128 mmHg) is also physiologically equivalent to the staged decompression atmosphere of 10.2 psia / 26.5% O2 (inspired O2 pressure = 127 mmHg) used on 34 different shuttle missions for approximately a week each flight. As a result of selecting this internal environment, NASA gains the capability for efficient EVA with low risk of decompression sickness (DCS), but not without incurring the additional negative stimulus of hypobaric hypoxia to the already physiologically challenging spaceflight environment. This report provides a review of the human health and performance risks associated with the use of the 8.2 psia / 34% O2 environment during spaceflight. Of most concern are the potential effects on the central nervous system (CNS), including increased intracranial pressure, visual impairment, sensorimotor dysfunction, and oxidative damage. Other areas of focus include validation of the DCS mitigation strategy, incidence and treatment of transient acute mountain sickness (AMS), development of new exercise countermeasure protocols, effective food preparation at 8.2 psia, assurance of quality sleep, and prevention of suit-induced injury. Although missions proposing to use an 8.2/34 environment are still years away, it is recommended that these studies begin early enough to ensure that the correct decisions pertaining to vehicle design, mission operational concepts, and human health countermeasures are appropriately informed.","[{""submissionId"":20150021491,""id"":""c985f195b06c4123963ce3ecc225b953"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Oceanography""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150021491
20220014425,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Functional Task Tests in Partial Gravity During Parabolic Flight,"[""T. R. Macaulay"",""A. Bollinger"",""S. J. Wood"",""M. F. Reschke"",""G. R. Clement""]","BACKGROUND 
Critical mission tasks required by crews immediately after landing on a planetary surface include walking, jumping, and egressing from a seat. Understanding how these functional tasks are performed in partial gravity such as on the moon or Mars is necessary to define effective and comprehensive countermeasure strategies for preserving crew performance during exploration-class missions. We propose to study the performance of these tasks during the partial gravity phases of parabolic flight. These tasks will be performed using the same equipment and procedures as those used with astronauts returning from spaceflight and with ground-based subjects after prolonged axial body unloading during bed rest (sensorimotor standard measures). 

HYPOTHESIS
We hypothesize that partial gravity during parabolic flight will cause acute changes in vestibular, proprioceptive, and sensorimotor functions, and these changes will impact the performance of mission critical tasks such as standing, walking, and jumping. The largest changes in performance are expected at the lowest gravity level (0.25g) because subjects will no longer be able to use the gravitational reference for the perception of upright. Ultimately, this information could be used to assess performance risks and inform the design of countermeasures for NASA exploration-class human missions.

METHODS
Twelve subjects will be tested during three flights of 30 parabolas, including 10 parabolas at 0.25g, 10 parabolas at 0.5g, and 10 parabolas at 0.75g. Subjects also will perform tests in 1g between parabolas. The  tasks will be the same as those tested on astronauts returning from spaceflight: sit-to-stand with obstacle walk, tandem rail balance, jump down, and recovery from fall. Measurements will include: (a) time to test completion (sit-to-stand with obstacle walk, recovery from fall); (b) time elapsed between the start of motion and the stabilization of upright posture (recovery from fall, jump down); (c) mean sway speed during quiet standing (recovery from fall, jump down); (d) changes in heart rate and blood pressure (recovery from fall); (e) balance time and torso accelerations (tandem rail balance); (f) cone of stability (jump down); and (g) severity of motion sickness symptoms.

RELEVANCE
Although gravitational dose-response curves have been obtained for some biochemical systems in animals, these dose-responses are unknown for most human physiologic systems. Our study will compare the outcomes of four functional task tests in 0.25g, 0.5g, 0.75g, and 1g with those previously obtained in ground-based subjects after prolonged axial body unloading and in astronauts immediately after spaceflight. These comparisons will help us understand the true extent of functional task performance deficits in partial gravity. The dose-response relationship between gravity level and task performance decrement also will help determining the gravity threshold for these functional tasks.

Acute CNS risks may include: altered cognitive function, reduced motor function, and behavioral changes, all of which may affect performance and human health. Late CNS risks may include neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia and premature aging. Although detrimental CNS changes are observed in humans treated with high-dose radiation (e.g., gamma rays and 9 protons) for cancer and are supported by experimental evidence showing neurocognitive and behavioral effects in animal models, the significance of these results on the morbidity to astronauts has not been elucidated. There is a lack of human epidemiology data on which to base CNS risk estimates; therefore, risk projection based on scaling to human data, as done for cancer risk, is not possible for CNS risks.

20150016007,OTHER,Evidence Report: Risk of Acute and Late Central Nervous System Effects from Radiation Exposure,"[""Nelson, Gregory A."",""Simonsen, Lisa"",""Huff, Janice L.""]"," Possible acute and late risks to the central nervous system (CNS) from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE) are a documented concern for human exploration of space. Acute CNS risks include: altered cognitive function, reduced motor function, and behavioral changes, all of which may affect performance and human health. Late CNS risks include neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia and premature aging. Although detrimental CNS changes are observed in humans treated with high-dose radiation (e.g., gamma rays and protons) for cancer and are supported by experimental evidence showing neurocognitive and behavioral effects in animal models, the significance of these results on the morbidity to astronauts has not been elucidated. There is a lack of human epidemiology data on which to base CNS risk estimates; therefore, risk projection based on scaling to human data, as done for cancer risk, is not possible for CNS risks. Research specific to the spaceflight environment using animal and cell models must be compiled to quantify the magnitude of CNS changes in order to estimate this risk and to establish validity of the current permissible exposure limits (PELs). In addition, the impact of radiation exposure in combination with individual sensitivity or other space flight factors, as well as assessment of the need for biological/pharmaceutical countermeasures, will be considered after further definition of CNS risk occurs.

20140006561,PRESENTATION,Delivery of Probiotics in the Space Food System,"[""Castro, S. L."",""Ott, C. M."",""Douglas, G. L.""]","The addition of probiotic bacteria to the space food system is expected to confer immunostimulatory benefits on crewmembers during spaceflight, counteracting the immune dysregulation that has been documented in spaceflight. Specifically, the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus has been shown to promote health benefits including antagonism towards and inhibition of virulence related gene expression in pathogens, mucosal stimulation of immune cells, and a reduction in the occurrence and duration of cold and flu‐like symptoms. The optimum delivery system for probiotics has not been determined for spaceflight, where the food system is shelf stable and the lack of refrigeration prevents the use of traditional dairy delivery methods. This work proposes to determine whether L. acidophilus is more viable, and therefore more likely to confer immune benefit, when delivered in a capsule form or when delivered in nonfat dry milk powder with a resuscitation opportunity upon rehydration, following 0, 4, and 8 months of storage at ‐80degC, 4degC, and 22degC, and both prior to and after challenge with simulated gastric and intestinal juices. We hypothesize that the low moisture neutral dairy matrix provided by the nonfat dry milk, and the rehydration step prior to consumption, will extend probiotic viability and stress tolerance compared to a capsule during potential storage conditions in spaceflight and in simulated digestion conditions.","[{""submissionId"":20140006561,""id"":""2e8868ab9dae48dbac487ba239a6ccd7"",""publicationDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140006561,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""2ec01b532d55473caaf13944fb74faed""},{""submissionId"":20140006561,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""66d47c136541403b943628e873e161d7""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140006561,""endDate"":""2014-02-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""8ccaff322ecb48d2811364bf91d9f59d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""46638c46b6544154ad5f33dd62fb2b34"",""id"":""1aa501cefab243aa974a90e76a91699e""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""46638c46b6544154ad5f33dd62fb2b34"",""id"":""c77251c7f1a14fef94cbc98673dfc62d""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""46638c46b6544154ad5f33dd62fb2b34"",""id"":""3b1902396b214dcf9b6b0a06ae19b675""}],""name"":""2014 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP 2014)"",""location"":""Galveston,TX"",""id"":""46638c46b6544154ad5f33dd62fb2b34"",""startDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]","[{""id"":20140005954,""title"":""Delivery of Probiotics in the Space Food System""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140006561

20170002604,ABSTRACT,A PCR Based Microbial Monitoring Alternative Method of Detection and Identification of Microbes Aboard ISS,"[""Christina Khodadad"",""Cherie Oubre"",""Victoria Castro"",""Stephanie Flint"",""Mark Ott"",""Monserrate Roman"",""Ray Wheeler"",""Orlando Melendez""]","Previous research has shown that microorganisms and potential human pathogens have been detected on the International Space Station (ISS) with additional introduction of new microflora occurring with every exchange of crew or addition of equipment and supplies. These microbes are readily transferred between crew and subsystems (i.e. ECLSS, environmental control and life support systems). As this can be detrimental to astronaut health and optimal performance of ISS systems, monitoring of systems such as ECLSS to include identification of microbial contaminants could prevent adverse effects on human health and life support systems. Current monitoring on ISS is laborious and utilizes culture based methods followed by sample return to Earth for complete analysis. Future, long-distance spaceflight missions will require real-time monitoring capabilities that enable efficient and rapid assessments of the microbial environment allowing for expedited decisions and more targeted response to cope with anomalies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a molecular microbial monitoring method was chosen and numerous PCR instruments investigated for their potential to perform in microgravity conditions. Using ISS as a test bed for PCR verification in microgravity will enable NASA to assess whether molecular based microbiological sensors may be components of reliable, closed-loop life support and habitation systems in spacecraft, enhancing infrastructure capabilities through increased efficiency, reliability, and time savings by enabling sample analysis on orbit. NASA selected the Water Monitoring Suite as one of the rapid spaceflight hardware demonstration activities utilizing a streamlined process to minimize the time required to fly experimental flight hardware. The RAZOR EX (BioFire Defense, Salt Lake City, UT) system was part of the water monitoring suite and is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) real-time PCR instrument designed for field work. The RAZOR EX was originally designed for Department of Defense (DoD) under a small business innovative research (SBIR) grant and is ruggedized, compact and provides a rapid, sample to answer in less than an hour. PCR assays using a fluorescent probe were optimized and spiked with known concentrations of DNA (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) ranging from 0.002 to 20 ng. PCR reagents were lyophilized and configured in customized pouches and tested for flight readiness. Three types of water were used to rehydrate the reagents and demonstrate the fidelity of the PCR reaction in microgravity. Molecular grade deionized water served as a control while filtered and unfiltered ISS potable water served to test for chemical or biological inhibitors. All three types were compared to parallel ground test results. Nine tests were run on ISS (3 of each water type) and the critical threshold cycle (Ct) was compared to parallel ground tests completed at Kennedy Space Center, FL and Johnson Space Center, TX. All concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa DNA were detected. A comparison of the Ct produced in real time PCR indicated similarity between flight and ground samples. There appeared to be no significant difference between flight or ground PCR reactions or between any of the three water types. This testing demonstrated the ability to perform molecular testing during spaceflight operations with similar sensitivity. It will allow for future ground development of molecular protocols and minimize the need for spaceflight testing. Future testing will include development of additional targets including environmental and health related organisms.","[{""submissionId"":20170002604,""id"":""26ce053a27aa41c19e8245c7bd7b76c0"",""publicationDate"":""2017-07-17T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20170002604,""name"":""American Astronomical Society"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States"",""id"":""2b4188ae516148b78ae04713474734c7""},{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20170002604,""endDate"":""2017-07-20T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""3c331303e1885ed4b4fd4970bd6f644a"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Center for the Advancement of Science in Space"",""location"":""Melbourne, Florida, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f8e0786d96fa401b9bb68ed328320383"",""id"":""467ad06c7dd74edfafaf147678fd0e28""},{""organizationId"":""4a2951f82ac556ae8fbdafdfb8996b78"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Astronomical Society"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f8e0786d96fa401b9bb68ed328320383"",""id"":""505bf71554644153b18ea9c5cba8c802""},{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f8e0786d96fa401b9bb68ed328320383"",""id"":""e8827e6e0c7e4d4083b334dc69b8ca16""}],""name"":""International Space Station Research and Development (ISS R&D) Conference"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""f8e0786d96fa401b9bb68ed328320383"",""startDate"":""2017-07-17T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170002604
20090007456,ABSTRACT,Microbial Risk Assessment,"[""Ott, C. M."",""Mena, K. D."",""Nickerson, C.A."",""Pierson, D. L.""]","Historically, microbiological spaceflight requirements have been established in a subjective manner based upon expert opinion of both environmental and clinical monitoring results and the incidence of disease. The limited amount of data, especially from long-duration missions, has created very conservative requirements based primarily on the concentration of microorganisms. Periodic reevaluations of new data from later missions have allowed some relaxation of these stringent requirements. However, the requirements remain very conservative and subjective in nature, and the risk of crew illness due to infectious microorganisms is not well defined. The use of modeling techniques for microbial risk has been applied in the food and potable water industries and has exceptional potential for spaceflight applications. From a productivity standpoint, this type of modeling can (1) decrease unnecessary costs and resource usage and (2) prevent inadequate or inappropriate data for health assessment. In addition, a quantitative model has several advantages for risk management and communication. By identifying the variable components of the model and the knowledge associated with each component, this type of modeling can: (1) Systematically identify and close knowledge gaps, (2) Systematically identify acceptable and unacceptable risks, (3) Improve communication with stakeholders as to the reasons for resource use, and (4) Facilitate external scientific approval of the NASA requirements. The modeling of microbial risk involves the evaluation of several key factors including hazard identification, crew exposure assessment, dose-response assessment, and risk characterization. Many of these factors are similar to conditions found on Earth; however, the spaceflight environment is very specialized as the inhabitants live in a small, semi-closed environment that is often dependent on regenerative life support systems. To further complicate modeling efforts, microbial dose-response characteristics may be affected by a potentially dysfunctional crew immune system during a mission. In addition, microbial virulence has been shown to change under certain conditions during spaceflight, further complicating dose-response characterization. An initial study of the applicability of microbial risk assessment techniques was performed using Crew Health Care System (CHeCS) operational data from the International Space Station potable water systems. The risk of infection from potable water was selected as the flight systems and microbial ecology are well defined. This initial study confirmed the feasibility of using microbial risk assessment modeling for spaceflight systems. While no immediate threat was detected, the study identified several medically significant microorganisms that could pose a health risk if uncontrolled. The study also identified several specific knowledge gaps in making a risk assessment and noted that filling these knowledge gaps is essential as the risk estimates may change by orders of magnitude depending on the answers. The current phase of the microbial risk assessment studies focuses on the dose-response relationship of specific infectious agents, focusing on Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, Pseudomonas spp., and Escherichia coli, as their evaluation will provide a better baseline for determining the overall hazard characterization. The organisms were chosen as they either have been isolated on spacecraft or have an identified route of infection during a mission. The characterization will utilize dose-response models selected either from the peer-reviewed literature and/or by using statistical approaches. Development of these modeling and risk assessment techniques will help to optimize flight requirements and to protect the safety, health, and performance of the crew.","[{""submissionId"":20090007456,""id"":""d84f8054836f49a29c473d18752e9715"",""publicationDate"":""2009-02-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20090007456,""endDate"":""2009-02-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""8ccaff322ecb48d2811364bf91d9f59d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""be0875aa3c6f4f88ada09670b20764a1"",""id"":""daf979f1d9da475fbfecd749c6c06cc9""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators Workshop"",""location"":""League City, TX"",""id"":""be0875aa3c6f4f88ada09670b20764a1"",""startDate"":""2009-02-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090007456

We report that under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) stationary-phase uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) become more resistant to gentamicin (Gm). UPEC causes urinary tract infections (UTIs), reported to afflict astronauts; Gm is a standard treatment, so these findings could impact astronaut health. Because LSMMG has been shown to differ from MG, we report here preparations to examine UPEC's Gm sensitivity during spaceflight using the E. coli Anti-Microbial Satellite (EcAMSat) on a free flying nanosatellite in low Earth orbit. Within EcAMSats payload, a 48-microwell fluidic card contains and supports study of bacterial cultures at constant temperature; optical absorbance changes in cell suspensions are made at three wavelengths for each microwell and a fluid-delivery system provides growth medium and predefined Gm concentrations. Performance characterization is reported for spaceflight prototypes of this payload system. Using conventional microtiter plates, we show that Alamar Blue (AB) absorbance changes due to cellular metabolism accurately reflect E. coli viability changes: measuring AB absorbance onboard EcAMSat will enable telemetry of spaceflight data to Earth. Laboratory results using payload prototypes are consistent with wellplate and flask findings of differential sensitivity of UPEC and its delta rpoS strain to Gm. Space MG studies using EcAMSat should clarify inconsistencies from previous space experiments on bacterial antibiotic sensitivity. Further, if sigma (sup s) plays the same role in space MG as in LSMMG and Earth gravity, EcAMSat results would facilitate utilizing our previously developed terrestrial UTI countermeasures in astronauts.","[{""submissionId"":20190001420,""id"":""7ba7c6ce477740fd84a9af5f7e304bba"",""publicationDate"":""2016-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNA13AC87"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190001420

Understanding the impact that space has on human health is paramount to the success of these missions. Controlled experiments with model organisms are run to infer the impact of space conditions on human health, but the data these experiments generate are too large to transfer to Earth for building models.  The same is true for space-relevant data generated on Earth.  Ideally, these datasets should be combined to improve statistical power and model accuracy without having to transfer data.  Federated learning is such a method which trains an algorithm across decentralized computing systems, each of which has their own local copy of training and testing data.

20140004048,ABSTRACT,A Case for Hypogravity Studies Aboard ISS,"[""Paloski, William H.""]","Future human space exploration missions being contemplated by NASA and other spacefaring nations include some that would require long stays upon bodies having gravity levels much lower than that of Earth. While we have been able to quantify the physiological effects of sustained exposure to microgravity during various spaceflight programs over the past half-century, there has been no opportunity to study the physiological adaptations to gravity levels between zero-g and one-g. We know now that the microgravity environment of spaceflight drives adaptive responses of the bone, muscle, cardiovascular, and sensorimotor systems, causing bone demineralization, muscle atrophy, reduced aerobic capacity, motion sickness, and malcoordination. All of these outcomes can affect crew health and performance, particularly after return to a one-g environment. An important question for physicians, scientists, and mission designers planning human exploration missions to Mars (3/8 g), the Moon (1/6 g), or asteroids (likely negligible g) is: What protection can be expected from gravitational levels between zero-g and one-g? Will crewmembers deconditioned by six months of microgravity exposure on their way to Mars experience continued deconditioning on the Martian surface? Or, will the 3/8 g be sufficient to arrest or even reverse these adaptive changes? The implications for countermeasure deployment, habitat accommodations, and mission design warrant further investigation into the physiological responses to hypogravity. It is not possible to fully simulate hypogravity exposure on Earth for other than transient episodes (e.g., parabolic flight). However, it would be possible to do so in low Earth orbit (LEO) using the centrifugal forces produced in a live-aboard centrifuge. As we're not likely to launch a rotating human spacecraft into LEO anytime in the near future, we could take advantage of rodent subjects aboard the ISS if we had a centrifuge that could accommodate the rodent subjects for extended periods (weeks to months) at various hypogravity levels. Experiments aboard such a centrifuge could provide important insight into human exploration questions and simultaneously answer fundamental questions in gravitational physiology.","[{""submissionId"":20140004048,""id"":""74ff425c9a0447aca45645652a3f8d07"",""publicationDate"":""2014-05-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140004048,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States"",""id"":""93ffbbeb45774a59bfe3f30a60b3ad3d""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140004048,""endDate"":""2014-05-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ef67d12d294640c7a7d31a2705cc740e"",""id"":""7f523e2768034a849640bb3630b97b96""}],""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association 2014 Annual Meeting"",""location"":""San Diego, CA"",""id"":""ef67d12d294640c7a7d31a2705cc740e"",""startDate"":""2014-05-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140004048
20220012419,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Neurovascular effects of simulated space radiation,"[""Egle Cekanaviciute""]","A major health risk for human deep space exploration is central nervous system (CNS) damage by ionizing radiation. Simulated galactic cosmic rays or their components, especially high-linear energy transfer particles such as 56Fe ions, have been shown to cause CNS damage, neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in rodent models, but their effects on human CNS remain to be investigated. CNS damage from any insult, including ionizing radiation, is partially mediated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which regulates interactions between CNS and the rest of the body. Astrocytes are major cellular regulators of BBB permeability and also modulate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. However, BBB and astrocyte functions in regulating CNS responses to space radiation remain little investigated, especially in human organ analogs. Therefore, we developed and utilized a high-throughput 3D human neurovascular organ-on-a-chip model, seeded with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cells. The effects of time course, ionizing radiation dose and dose rate were mapped by exposing the model to either acute, high dose rate radiation with simulated galactic cosmic rays or 600 MeV/n 56Fe particles, or protracted, low dose rate gamma radiation using a 57Co sealed source setup. We investigated BBB permeability, oxidative stress, cellular damage and secreted factors over the time period between 24 hours – 2 weeks after 0.1 – 0.8 Gy irradiation. We observed that ionizing radiation exposure increased BBB permeability, caused oxidative stress, damaged endothelial cells and altered expression of inflammatory cytokines with a subset of outcomes dependent on ionizing radiation dose rate. Furthermore, our results indicated that astrocyte functions were primarily deleterious at early time points and protective later after irradiation, resembling CNS responses to injury in vivo. Our findings in organ models were complemented by studies on true spaceflight using mouse spatial and single cell multi-omics, which similarly indicated spaceflight-mediated changes in astrocyte functions. In summary, our study evaluates the regulation of neurovascular responses to simulated space radiation, suggesting astrocytes as targets for countermeasures to mitigate CNS damage in deep space exploration.

Mark"",""Bruce, Rebekah"",""Castro, Victoria A."",""Mehta, Satish K.""]","After 30 years of being the centerpiece of NASA s human spacecraft, the Space Shuttle will retire. This highly successful program provided many valuable lessons for the International Space Station (ISS) and future spacecraft. Major microbiological risks to crewmembers include food, water, air, surfaces, payloads, animals, other crewmembers, and ground support personnel. Adverse effects of microorganisms are varied and can jeopardize crew health and safety, spacecraft systems, and mission objectives. Engineering practices and operational procedures can minimize the negative effects of microorganisms. To minimize problems associated with microorganisms, appropriate steps must begin in the design phase of new spacecraft or space habitats. Spacecraft design must include requirements to control accumulation of water including humidity, leaks, and condensate on surfaces. Materials used in habitable volumes must not contribute to microbial growth. Use of appropriate materials and the implementation of robust housekeeping that utilizes periodic cleaning and disinfection will prevent high levels of microbial growth on surfaces. Air filtration can ensure low levels of bioaerosols and particulates in the breathing air. The use of physical and chemical steps to disinfect drinking water coupled with filtration can provide safe drinking water. Thorough preflight examination of flight crews, consumables, and the environment can greatly reduce pathogens in spacecraft. The advances in knowledge of living and working onboard the Space Shuttle formed the foundation for environmental microbiology requirements and operations for the International Space Station (ISS) and future spacecraft. Research conducted during the Space Shuttle Program resulted in an improved understanding of the effects of spaceflight on human physiology, microbial properties, and specifically the host-microbe interactions. Host-microbe interactions are substantially affected by spaceflight. Astronaut immune functions were found to be altered. Selected microorganisms were found to become more virulent during spaceflight. The increased knowledge gained on the Space Shuttle resulted in further studies of the host-microbe interactions on the ISS to determine if countermeasures were necessary. Lessons learned from the Space Shuttle Program were integrated into the ISS resulting in the safest space habitat to date.","[{""submissionId"":20110013207,""id"":""4f7c14c565c6447fa808eb2fbfe23bc0"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110013207,""endDate"":""2011-07-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""41st futemational Meeting on Enviromental Systems"",""location"":""Portland, OR"",""id"":""ab03955967934ba9af6f344a0a9be553"",""startDate"":""2011-07-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110013207

As space agencies and private companies continue to push the boundaries of human exploration, it is essential to understand the risks associated with Extravehicular Activities (EVAs) and develop strategies to mitigate them. The tempo at which EVAs are conducted – the total number and frequency of these activities – can have a profound impact on medical risks, resource consumption, and overall mission success. 

Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) provides a powerful framework for evaluating complex systems and identifying potential hazards. Our work employs the Medical Extensible Dynamic Probabilistic Risk Assessment Tool (MEDPRAT) [1] to simulate mission events, occurrence and treatment of medical conditions, and track the utilization of resources. Coupled with the Evidence Library [2], a medical evidence base for exploration-class missions developed by the Exploration Medical Capability within NASA’s Human Research Program, we can estimate these risks with increased fidelity and optimize medical kit contents to meet specific mission requirements.

This presentation provides a detailed examination of how EVA tempo influences medical risk estimates for a lunar surface design reference mission. A comprehensive analysis is conducted to assess the additional mass and volume burden imposed on medical kits required to maintain adequate levels of risk mitigation. Furthermore, we estimate the distribution of the number of successful EVAs completed based on the level of task impairment imposed by medical events and flight rules related to specific medical events, such as decompression sickness.

The Space Medicine Exploration Medical Conditions List (SMEMCL), developed by the Exploration Medical Capability element of the Human Research Program, addresses the risk of ""unacceptable health and mission outcomes due to limitations of in-flight medical capabilities"". It itemizes 85 evidence-based clinical requirements for eight different mission profiles and identifies conditions warranting further research and technology development. Each condition is given a clinical priority for each mission profile. Four conditions -- intra-abdominal infections, skin lacerations, anaphylaxis, and behavioral emergencies -- were selected as a starting point for analysis. A systematic literature review was performed to understand how these conditions are treated in austere, limited-resource, space-analog environments (i.e., high-altitude and mountain environments, submarines, military deployments, Antarctica, isolated wilderness environments, in-flight environments, and remote, resource-poor, rural environments). These environments serve as analogs to spaceflight because of their shared characteristics (limited medical resources, delay in communication, confined living quarters, difficulty with resupply, variable time to evacuation). Treatment of these four medical conditions in austere environments provides insight into medical equipment and training requirements for exploration-class missions.","[{""submissionId"":20120014366,""id"":""258400fd28b246faa8eed72b920095e7"",""publicationDate"":""2012-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120014366

Plant care and the addition of fresh veggies to the diet may also have a role in astronaut well-being. Pick-and-eat salad crops are the best candidates for this near-term supplementation since they require minimal processing or preparation to add to meals. While light quality can strongly influence plant responses on Earth, the impacts of light quality on plant growth and composition in spaceflight remain unclear. The VEG-04 experiment uses two Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station to simultaneously test different red: blue light ratios on the growth of Mizuna mustard, a leafy green salad crop. In addition to plant health and yield, the composition of key nutrients is assessed. Astronauts conduct on-board organoleptic evaluation of the fresh produce. Microbial food safety of returned produce is examined, and a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan has been developed for this crop. VEG-04 consists of two experiments, one lasting 28 days with a single harvest, and the second lasting 56 days, with three cut-and-come-again harvests. These different scenarios provide an opportunity to test two production concepts, examine different fertilizers, monitor microbial changes over time for this crop, and assess potential impacts of interacting with plants on crew behavioral health and performance in spaceflight operations. In ground testing, plant growth was not significantly different across the different light treatments, however nutrient composition did differ significantly. Flight test results will be compared with ground data.

20230015159,PRESENTATION,Radiation Transport Models in Space: from Supernovae to Cells,"[""Tony C. Slaba""]","Humans embarking on deep space exploration missions will encounter persistent exposure to galactic cosmic rays (GCR) - an energetic and highly complex radiation field that is unlike anything found on Earth. Exposure to such radiation fields is attributed to various adverse health effects, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive impairment and is identified by NASA as one of the five main hazards of human spaceflight. It is therefore critical to be able to fully characterize the exposure received by humans behind shielding in space and project consequent health risks. A wide variety of computational models have been developed over the years to help meet this requirement. In this talk, an overview of the GCR environment in deep space is provided. Methods of propagating GCR fields through the shielding that protects humans in space are described along with simulation tools used to assess biological damage at the cellular scale. Finally, the NASA cancer risk model is briefly described, and risk projections are provided for various mission scenarios. Radiation transport models and solution methods pervade many aspects of this talk. For example, the GCR spectrum impinging on spacecraft is determined by solving the Fokker-Planck transport equation to propagate cosmic rays (believed to originate from supernovae) from the edge of the heliosphere to the vicinity of Earth. The Boltzmann transport equation is solved to transport this GCR spectrum through shielding and human tissue. Monte Carlo methods are used to simulate the transport of low energy electrons that dominate biological damage at the cellular scale. Progress and challenges in each of these areas will be highlighted.

20210022852,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Functional Task Tests in Partial Gravity During Parabolic Flight,"[""Gilles Clement"",""Marissa Rosenberg"",""Timothy Macaulay"",""Millard Reschke""]","BACKGROUND
Critical mission tasks that are required by crews immediately after landing on a planetary surface are seat egress, jump, and walk. To be able to define an effective and comprehensive countermeasure strategy for preserving crew performance during exploration-class missions, there is a need to understand how these functional tasks are actually performed in partial gravity such as on the Moon or Mars. We propose to study the performance in the execution of these tasks during the partial gravity and hypergravity phases of parabolic flight. These tasks will be completed using the same equipment and procedures as the Standard Measures Sensorimotor protocol, which is performed by astronauts returning from spaceflight and by ground-based subjects after prolonged axial body unloading during bed rest.
HYPOTHESIS
We hypothesize that partial gravity during parabolic flight will cause acute changes in vestibular, proprioceptive, and sensorimotor functions, and these changes will impact the performance of mission critical tasks such as standing, walking, and jumping. The largest changes in performance are expected at the lowest gravity level (0.25g) because subjects will no longer be able to use the gravitational reference for the perception of vertical. Ultimately, this information could be used to assess performance risks and inform the design of countermeasures for NASA exploration-class human missions.
METHODS
Twelve subjects will be tested during three flights of 30 parabolas, including 10 parabolas at 0.25g, 10 parabolas at 0.5g and 10 parabolas at 0.75g. Subject also will perform tests in 1g between parabolas and in hypergravity (1.8g) during the pull-out phases. Subjects will perform the same tasks as those tested on astronauts returning from spaceflight: sit-to-stand and obstacle walk, tandem walk, jump down, and recovery from fall. Measurements will include: (a) the time for the subject to complete the test (sit-to-stand and obstacle walk, recovery from fall); (b) the time elapsed between the start of motion and the stabilization of upright posture (recovery from fall, jump down); (c) the mean sway speed during quiet standing (recovery from fall, jump down); (d) changes in heart rate and blood pressure (recovery from fall); (e) the percentage of correct steps and torso acceleration (tandem walk); and (f) the severity of motion sickness symptoms.
RELEVANCE
Although gravitational dose-response curves have been obtained for some biochemical systems in animals, these dose-responses are unknown for most human physiologic systems. Our study will compare the outcomes of 5 functional task tests in 0.25g, 0.5g, 0.75g, 1g, and 1.8g with those previously obtained in ground-based subjects after prolonged axial body unloading and in astronauts immediately after spaceflight. This comparison will help understanding the true extent of functional task performance deficits in partial gravity. The dose-response relationship between gravity level and task performance decrement also will help determining the gravity threshold for these functional tasks.

The overall goal was to help inspire creativity that will guide us towards new synergistic ideas complementing these existing disciplines that are of such importance to NASA. Workshop participants aspired to: (1) Exploit synergies across the biological sciences at NASA, (2) Foster research, enabling technology, and mission concepts that support commonalities in space biology, astrobiology, synthetic biology, planetary protection, and relevant human health, performance, and habitation concerns, (3) Envision the development of an “Arc of Biology in Space” to encompass this multi-faceted joint research community.

The focused objective of the workshop series was to explore and demonstrate how the integration of astrobiology and space biology could be achieved, identify strengths and weaknesses in the current state of the art, and recognize where our greatest challenges lay.  Specifically, we seek to: (1) Establish a scientific framework for an integrated life sciences effort, (2) Pioneer discovery by creating unique opportunities in the fundamental biological sciences, (3) Explore novel combinations of existing technologies across the relevant disciplines, (4) Invent new technologies and applications in space life sciences, and (5) Creatively increase access to spaceflight, emerging and novel technologies, Earth analogs, and simulated natural and spaceflight environments.

The community aims for a broad arc of biological competence in the context of space and planetary science, spaceflight, and habitation.

Extended distance and multi-year missions introduce new elements of operational complexity and additional risk. These elements include: inability to resupply medications and consumables, inability to evacuate injured or ill crew, uncharted psychosocial conditions, and communication delays that create a requirement for some level of autonomous medical capability. Because of these unique challenges, the approaches used in prior programs have limited application to a Mars mission. On a Mars mission, resource limitations will significantly constrain available medical capabilities, and require a paradigm shift in the approach to medical system design and risk mitigation for crew health. To respond to this need for a new paradigm, the Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element is assessing each Mars mission phase-transit, surface stay, rendezvous, extravehicular activity, and return-to identify and prioritize medical needs for the journey beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). ExMC is addressing both planned medical operations, and unplanned contingency medical operations that meld clinical needs and research needs into a single system. This assessment is being used to derive a gap analysis and studies to support meaningful medical capabilities trades. These trades, in turn, allow the exploration medical system design to proceed from both a mission centric and ethics-based approach, and to manage the risks associated with the medical limitations inherent in an exploration class mission. This paper outlines the conceptual drivers used to derive medical system and vehicle needs from an integrated vision of how medical care will be provided within this paradigm.

20205008547,PRESENTATION,The Integration of Life Sciences in Space: Astrobiology and Space Biology Virtual Workshops Report,"[""Jon Rask"",""Penelope Boston"",""Edward Goolish"",""Melissa Kirven-Brooks"",""Sandra Dueck""]","A series of virtual workshops was held during June 2020 to seek ways to integrate the efforts of the astrobiology and space biology research communities under a broad umbrella of space life sciences. The overall goal was to help inspire creativity that will guide us towards new synergistic ideas complementing these existing disciplines that are of such importance to NASA. Workshop participants aspired to: (1) Exploit synergies across the biological sciences at NASA, (2) Foster research, enabling technology, and mission concepts that support commonalities in space biology, astrobiology, synthetic biology, planetary protection, and relevant human health, performance, and habitation concerns, (3) Envision the development of an “Arc of Biology in Space” to encompass this multi-faceted joint research community.

The focused objective of the workshop series was to explore and demonstrate how the integration of astrobiology and space biology could be achieved, identify strengths and weaknesses in the current state of the art, and recognize where our greatest challenges lay.  Specifically, we seek to: (1) Establish a scientific framework for an integrated life sciences effort, (2) Pioneer discovery by creating unique opportunities in the fundamental biological sciences, (3) Explore novel combinations of existing technologies across the relevant disciplines, (4) Invent new technologies and applications in space life sciences, and (5) Creatively increase access to spaceflight, emerging and novel technologies, Earth analogs, and simulated natural and spaceflight environments.

The community aims for a broad arc of biological competence in the context of space and planetary science, spaceflight, and habitation.

Meal replacement with nutritionally balanced, 700-900 calorie bars was identified as a method to reduce mass. However, commercially available products do not meet the requirements for a meal replacement in the spaceflight food system. The purpose of this task was to develop a variety of nutritionally balanced, high quality, breakfast replacement bars, which enable a 10% food mass savings. To date, six nutrient-dense meal replacement bars have been developed, all of which meet spaceflight nutritional, microbiological, sensory, and shelf-life requirements. The four highest scoring bars were evaluated based on final product sensory acceptability, nutritional stability, qualitative stability of analytical measurements (i.e. color and texture), and microbiological compliance over a period of two years to predict long-term acceptability. All bars maintained overall acceptability throughout the first year of storage, despite minor changes in color and texture. However, added vitamins C, B1, and B9 degraded rapidly in fortified samples of Banana Nut bars, indicating the need for additional development. In addition to shelf-life testing, four bar varieties were evaluated in the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA), campaign 3, to assess the frequency with which actual meal replacement options may be implemented, based on impact to satiety and psychosocial measurements. Crewmembers (n=16) were asked to consume meal replacement bars every day for the first fifteen days of the mission and every three days for the second half of the mission. Daily surveys assessed the crew's responses to bar acceptability, mood, food fatigue and perceived stress. Preliminary results indicate that the majority of crew members were noncompliant with daily meal replacement during the first half of the mission. Several crew members chose to forgo the meal, resulting in caloric deficits that were higher on skipped-bar days. Body mass loss was significant throughout the mission. Although there was no significant difference in body mass loss overall between the first half and second half of the mission, a higher number of individual crew members lost more body mass in the first half of the mission. Analysis is still ongoing, but current trends suggest that daily involuntary meal replacement can lead to greater individual impacts on body mass and psychological factors, while meal replacement on a more limited basis may be acceptable to most crew for missions up to 30 days. This data should be considered in Orion mass trades with health and human performance.","[{""submissionId"":20170009922,""id"":""eb4604a004cc4fd9aebfd4dfdec5fefc"",""publicationDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170009922,""endDate"":""2018-01-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""0ea94238e34b4c7db3421163f575f964"",""id"":""4809ac0055264a8ca9f602c7746dcd96""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigator''s Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""0ea94238e34b4c7db3421163f575f964"",""startDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170009922

D."",""Castillo, A. B."",""Globus, R. K.""]","Weightlessness causes a cephalad fluid shift and reduction in mechanical stimulation, adversely affecting both cortical and trabecular bone tissue in astronauts. In rodent models of weightlessness, the onset of bone loss correlates with reduced skeletal perfusion, reduced and rarified vasculature and lessened vasodilation, which resembles blood-bone symbiotic events that can occur with fracture repair and aging. These are especially serious risks for long term, exploration class missions when astronauts will face the challenge of increased exposure to space radiation and abrupt transitions between different gravity environments upon arrival and return. Previously, we found using the mouse hindlimb unloading model and exposure to heavy ion radiation, both disuse and irradiation cause an acute bone loss that was associated with a reduced capacity to produce bone-forming osteoblasts from the bone marrow. Together, these findings led us to hypothesize that exposure to space radiation exacerbates weightlessness-induced bone loss and impairs recovery upon return, and that treatment with anti-oxidants may mitigate these effects. The specific aims of this recently awarded grant are to: AIM 1 Determine the functional and structural consequences of prolonged weightlessness and space radiation (simulated spaceflight) for bone and skeletal vasculature in the context of bone cell function and oxidative stress. AIM 2 Determine the extent to which an anti-oxidant protects against weightlessness and space radiation-induced bone loss and vascular dysfunction. AIM 3 Determine how space radiation influences later skeletal and vasculature recovery from prolonged weightlessness and the potential of anti-oxidants to preserve adaptive remodeling.","[{""submissionId"":20120011349,""id"":""b1aed3b190ee41dfabc33d3153fcabea"",""publicationDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20120011349,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9b600851e6e64ad5a5aae3ab49149286"",""id"":""abeacb6bae2742939a29912d269d4781""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators Workshop"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""9b600851e6e64ad5a5aae3ab49149286"",""startDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""DE-SC0001507"",""NNH06CC03B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120011349
20150003008,ABSTRACT,Multilateral Research Opportunities in Ground Analogs,"[""Corbin, Barbara J.""]","The global economy forces many nations to consider their national investments and make difficult decisions regarding their investment in future exploration. International collaboration provides an opportunity to leverage other nations' investments to meet common goals. The Humans In Space Community shares a common goal to enable safe, reliable, and productive human space exploration within and beyond Low Earth Orbit. Meeting this goal requires efficient use of limited resources and International capabilities. The International Space Station (ISS) is our primary platform to conduct microgravity research targeted at reducing human health and performance risks for exploration missions. Access to ISS resources, however, is becoming more and more constrained and will only be available through 2020 or 2024. NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) is actively pursuing methods to effectively utilize the ISS and appropriate ground analogs to understand and mitigate human health and performance risks prior to embarking on human exploration of deep space destinations. HRP developed a plan to use ground analogs of increasing fidelity to address questions related to exploration missions and is inviting International participation in these planned campaigns. Using established working groups and multilateral panels, the HRP is working with multiple Space Agencies to invite International participation in a series of 30- day missions that HRP will conduct in the US owned and operated Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) during 2016. In addition, the HRP is negotiating access to Antarctic stations (both US and non-US), the German :envihab and Russian NEK facilities. These facilities provide unique capabilities to address critical research questions requiring longer duration simulation or isolation. We are negotiating release of international research opportunities to ensure a multilateral approach to future analog research campaigns, hoping to begin multilateral campaigns in the latter facilities by 2017. Collaborative use of analog facilities and shared investment in the development of spaceflight countermeasures through multilateral campaigns or missions that leverage the global scientific community will focus high quality research and provide sufficient power to accelerate the development of countermeasures and drive sound recommendations for exploration missions. This panel will provide an overview of efforts to encourage and facilitate multilateral collaboration in analog missions or campaigns and describe the facilities currently under consideration to reach the common goal of enabling safe, reliable, and productive human space exploration.

D.""]","Herpesviruses are leading causes of infectious blindness and death in immunocompromised individuals. Impaired cellular immunity, which is known to result in increased frequency and severity of herpesvirus infections, has been demonstrated both during and after spaceflight. Therefore, we examined whether Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a well-characterized latent herpesvirus, undergoes reactivation in astronauts. Sera from Shuttle astronauts, taken before and after spaceflight, were examined for evidence of EBV reactivation. The geometric mean antibody titer to EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) was significantly increased prior to flight compared to baseline (p = 0. 0001). After spaceflight, evidence of acute lytic replication was found in which 8- to 64-fold increases in EBV early antigen (EA) antibodies occurred without significant increases in antibodies to measles virus. Additionally, stress-induced shifts in circulating leukocytes and elevated levels of urinary cortisol and epinephrine were found. Overall, significant increases in EA or high VCA/EA antibody titers were found in 8 of 23 (35%) male astronauts and 3 of 5 (60%) female astronauts. These results indicate that stress reactivates EBV prior to flight and suggest that acute lytic replication of EBV occurs during spaceflight. Copyright 2000 S.

This rich source of meticulously curated metadata and data from spaceflight and analog studies has been mined by the scientific community resulting in dozens of high impact scientific publications that reveals a complex network of molecular and physiological effects of spaceflight across living systems, from microbes to plants, to mammals. Understanding how these effects translate to the human condition is critical as we move deeper into the era of commercial space travel. However, the integration of data, specifically omics data, from astronauts is particularly challenging due to their sensitive nature. OSDR has risen to this challenge by developing a mechanism to control access to identifiable levels of omics data, such as raw sequence data, while enabling public access to processed, unidentifiable, data and associated metadata that will allow the scientific community to interrogate human astronaut data alongside data from model organisms to begin answering these critical questions.

The 2021 SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission collected a comprehensive atlas of biological measurements from four civilian astronauts, providing a wealth of data to characterize the effects of spaceflight on the human body. These data include both non-omics and omics assays such as direct RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single nuclei ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, metagenomics, proteomics, and comprehensive metabolic and cytokine panels, all of which have been integrated into the OSDR system across no less than 9 studies. Each study has been carefully curated using community-backed OSDR standards for sample and assay level metadata ensuring these data are findable and accessible. In addition to hosting both raw and processed data from the principal investigator team for each assay type, the GeneLab team plans to re-process the I4 omics data using GeneLab’s standard processing pipelines. The GeneLab processed data outputs will allow for comparisons across studies on OSDR and enable visualization of these data through the OSDR data visualization platform thereby enabling data reusability and interoperability.

Here we describe the robust privacy and security protocols implemented by OSDR to safeguard sensitive health data from astronauts while facilitating metadata and processed data sharing for research purposes. We further provide a road map for navigating the vast amount of data provided for each I4 study on the OSDR, including experimental design, associated experiments, payloads, and missions, data generation and analysis protocols, and associated scientific articles. Additionally, we illustrate how to interrogate the standardized metadata provided in the sample and assay tables as well as various means to download and access the data including programmatically through the GeneLab Open API (GLOpenAPI). 
 
The open access of datasets in NASA’s OSDR provides a unique opportunity for the scientific community, as well as citizen scientists and students, to continue using OSDR resources to further unlock profound insights into the consequences of space travel on the human body. Through implementation of security measures to protect sensitive human data, the OSDR seeks to strengthen the science exchange between the Biological and Physical Sciences Program and the Human Research Program, per recommendation 4-1 of the 2023-2032 Decadal Survey, and encourage further sharing and dissemination of astronaut data to provide the scientific community with the resources needed to lay the groundwork for developing targeted mitigation strategies to help withstand the rigors of long-duration spaceflight.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230014307,""endDate"":""2024-02-16T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""16639dfa2e6c4769b080acd58334b0a5"",""id"":""d5cf1b184f6d42bca3cb682ac37a19c3""}],""name"":""NASA HRP Investigators' Workshop (IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston , Texas"",""id"":""16639dfa2e6c4769b080acd58334b0a5"",""url"":""https://www.nasa.gov/hrp-iws-2024/"",""startDate"":""2024-02-13T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.06.01.02.01.02""]",undefined,"[""Space Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20240001570,""title"":""Enabling Model Organism and Commercial Astronaut Data Access Through the NASA Open Science Data Repository""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230014307
20250005931,CONTRACTOR_OR_GRANTEE_REPORT,Team 6 – Moon to Mars Exploration Systems and Habitation: Senior Design Operational Readiness Report,"[""Jackson Butler"",""Bo Dombek"",""Trace Fletcher"",""Xavier Fuell"",""Benicio Gallegos"",""Julia Gomez"",""Megan Mack"",""Connor Murphy"",""Drew Turnipseed"",""Eric Zheng"",""Kyle Schulze""]","Life on extraterrestrial planets like the Earth’s Moon and Mars have unique qualities that most humans are not used to. Lower gravity has negative effects on humans’ biological systems. NASA studies show that “without Earth’s gravity affecting the human body, weight-bearing bones lose on average 1% to 1.5% of mineral density per month during spaceflight” [1]. Additionally, lessened gravity affects the human heart and circulatory system. NASA comments, “the loss of blood volume, combined with atrophy of the heart and blood vessels that can occur in space, reduces the ability to regulate a drop in blood pressure that happens while standing on Earth” [2]. Blood flow plays a key role in muscle growth. Essentially, humans lose muscle mass and bone density in a lower gravity environment. 

To counteract the reduction of bone density and muscle mass in a lower gravity environment, astronauts must endure resistance training, cardiovascular and bone strengthening exercises. Although these precautions do help to mitigate the loss of muscle and bone density and aid adequate cardiovascular health, astronauts continue to face issues upon returning to Earth. Some of these issues include difficulty walking or standing, lightheadedness, fainting, balance, coordination, and visual impairments like blurred vision. 

However, lower gravity changes the paradigm of mobility, especially in a habitat. Habitational systems are put on the Moon and Mars which include life support, environmental control, radiation protection, exercise and health maintenance, and other factors needed to keep the crew safe, healthy, and productive on long deep space missions. Instead of walking or using a staircase to increase elevation; astronauts can move in different ways such as climbing, swinging, pole transportation, jumping, and other modes around the habitat. These mobility modes allow for a more natural way to diminish the loss of muscle and bone density and maintain cardiovascular health. 

The objective of this project is to design elements in a habitat on the Earth’s Moon or Mars that consist of these mobility modes for a crew to use while navigating their daily routines within the habitat. This can be used to reduce the loss of muscle and bone density, maintain cardiovascular health, allow for a quicker way to traverse about the habitat, and introduce fun activities into everyday routines.","[{""submissionId"":20250005931,""id"":""d19e9f5000514446b71b29f3873879b8"",""publicationDate"":""2025-06-26T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""089407""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology and Life Support"",""Ground Support Systems and Facilities (Space)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250005931
20190033207,PRESENTATION,Gravity as a Continuum: Effects of Altered Gravity on Drosophila Melanogaster Immunity,"[""Olivieri, Joe"",""Paul, Amber M."",""Bhattacharya, Sharmila""]","The impact of spaceflight on immune function is undoubtedly a critical focus in the area of space biology and human health research. Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins that are expressed in response to cellular and physiological stressors, experienced during radiation exposure, confinement, circadian rhythm disruption, and altered gravity (hypergravity experienced at launch/landing and microgravity experienced in-flight). In particular, Hsp70 aids in the folding of proteins, facilitates the movement of proteins across the membranes during signal transductions and can stimulate innate immunity. Since Hsp70 is induced during cellular stress, and can act as a stimulator for innate immunity, we sought to address how a loss of Hsp70 affects immunity, under the stress-inducing model of acute and chronic hypergravity. Moreover, the effects of gravity as a continuum on the induction of Hsps and key immune genes were also assessed to determine if increased cellular stress, via increased gravity (g)-force, contributes to immune dysfunctions. For this, wildtype (W1118) and Hsp70 deficient (Hsp70null) Drosophila melanogaster were subjected to simulated hypergravity at increasing levels of g-force (1.2g, 3g, and 5g) for acute (1hr) and chronic (7-day) timepoints and were compared to 0g 'non-hypergravity' controls. Following simulation, whole bodies were sex-segregated, RNA was isolated and quantitative (q)PCR was performed to determine differential immune gene expression profiles. Further, functional output of hemocytes were assessed by a phagocytosis assay. Collectively, these studies evaluated the effects of Hsp70 in the context of immunity during acute and chronic hypergravity. Indeed, relevance for this work can directly translate to acute effects of launch/landing gravitational forces upon liftoff (~1.7g) and entry (~3.4g) that astronauts experience. In addition, the effects of chronic cellular stress is directly relevant to the immune health of astronauts on long duration missions, as well. Thus, as we approach the goal of returning to the Moon and landing the first humans on Mars, an evaluation of gravity as a continuum and the stress-inducing effects of altered gravity experienced during spaceflight on astronaut immunity and health are necessary.","[{""submissionId"":20190033207,""id"":""742b2b2b21f0491a9f40b71d755bf76c"",""publicationDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190033207,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""da8371b395c24c9f9a249467f30128d1""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190033207,""endDate"":""2019-11-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""de7b5c111c9c41e4ac1848b90fcee780"",""id"":""6abad9abcc024351b82322c302db9914""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""de7b5c111c9c41e4ac1848b90fcee780"",""startDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNH15CO48B""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190033207

20220005744,PRESENTATION,"Teams in Space: Knowledge Gained, but More to Explore","[""Lauren Blackwell Landon"",""Suzanne T. Bell""]","NASA’s Human Research Program oversees the Team Risk (i.e., Risk of Performance and Behavioral Health Decrements due to Inadequate Cooperation, Coordination, Communication and Psychosocial Adaptation within a Team). Research in this area informs all aspects of an astronaut’s career, from hiring to training to mission support, and works to address new challenges related to lunar and Mars missions. NASA’s astronaut selection process creates an astronaut corps of highly qualified, team-oriented individuals, which allows mission planners much flexibility in composing small crews for specific missions. These crews are further developed and supported through extensive training, including team skills training, and countermeasures available to the crew throughout the mission. However, in the high consequence environment of long-duration missions, team composition is complex and is not a one-time concern to be addressed pre-mission. Team factors such as team cohesion, dyadic relationships, and shared team cognition are likely to change dynamically in response to each interaction and event experienced by the individuals and the team as a whole. Thus, monitoring and optimizing team composition at a more micro level (e.g., per task) is one way to support team functioning and performance. Spaceflight teams research also includes the multi-team system of Mission Control and coordination between space-to-ground, adding another avenue in which risk might be introduced, particularly under exploration missions that experience significant communication delays. Spaceflight teams research has recently experienced a concentrated flurry of analog research over the past decade, shedding light on the many unique challenges and potential solutions to mitigate the team risk in long-duration exploration missions. However, questions still remain about how to, for example, create unobtrusive operational measures and how to advance interdisciplinary teams research and countermeasure development. We present an overview of the challenges facing teams in space, our current knowledge, and the next steps for research and spaceflight operations.

Mcclam"",""Melissa D. Flores""]","The Artemis I mission in 2022 accomplished humanity’s first venture beyond Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) with a human-rated spacecraft in over fifty years. Artemis comprises several key Program elements – Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Orion Crew Module, Service Module, Launch Abort System; the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Exploration Ground System (EGS). Much of our human spaceflight experience with crewed lunar missions is captured in historical program documents, but first-hand knowledge is limited to a few spaceflight veterans. Missions to LEO have offered the opportunity of direct, near-instantaneous communications and assistance, and the ability to return to Earth within a matter of hours in case of emergency. Outward-bound missions do not have these features and will require a more autonomous and reliable spacecraft.

The assessment of compliance with applicable safety requirements and adequacy of hazard controls and verifications is the responsibility of the MPCV Safety and Engineering Review Panel (MSERP), along with a Joint [NASA/ESA] Safety and Engineering Review Panel (JSERP) for the review of the European Service Module (ESM). The MSERP has two features that are relatively unique amongst NASA safety panels. First, NASA Engineering was added as a Panel co-chair, which enhanced the Engineering organization’s engagement and level of understanding of hazard analysis methodology and results. The MSERP has representation from each office, including Flight Operations Directorate (FOD) and Health and Medical Technical Authority, supporting the Orion Program in addition to the Engineering and Safety Technical Authority co-chairs.  Second, the JSERP has a second set of co-chairs from ESA Engineering and ESA Product Assurance and Safety organizations, which recognizes the international arrangement as one of partnership.

Oxygen, water and food are absolute requirements to sustain life and must be supplied at adequate rates. However, these rates can vary from day to day and from person to person. Beyond the body's immediate physical needs, water is also required for important health and hygiene functions within the spacecraft. Undesirable weight loss or gain aside, human waste product mass outputs will equal the inputs over time, resulting in an average astronaut mass balance. Best values, as well as range of variability for inputs and outputs are explored at both the individual physiological level and the spacecraft level. These values are important for design of life support and habitability systems as well as for mission planning of consumables. Current spacecraft life support systems are not fully closed loop, but the International Space Station (ISS) does recycle most of its air and water. The astronaut mass balances at the personal and vehicle level can have different impacts at different levels of system closure. Recommendations are made for a consistent set of values representing a realistic average astronaut mass balance over reasonable durations for exploration missions.","[{""submissionId"":20190027563,""id"":""003539d303a04361a1f7fb5827f9b5ab"",""publicationDate"":""2019-07-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190027563,""name"":""International Conference On Environmental Systems, Inc."",""location"":""Stafford Springs, CT, United States"",""id"":""ade84b479e984865aa0d92fe5acd4788""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190027563,""endDate"":""2019-07-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Conference On Environmental Systems, Inc."",""location"":""Stafford Springs, CT, United States""}},""meetingId"":""1dcd5e8967694cfd9b17c74a17c13176"",""id"":""366d09f84b5342ed9a335ec5330b6a9a""}],""name"":""International Conference on Environmental Systems (ICES 2019)"",""location"":""Boston, MA"",""id"":""1dcd5e8967694cfd9b17c74a17c13176"",""startDate"":""2019-07-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""80LARC17C0003""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190027563

This rich source of meticulously curated metadata and data from spaceflight and analog studies has been mined by the scientific community resulting in dozens of high impact scientific publications that reveals a complex network of molecular and physiological effects of spaceflight across living systems, from microbes to plants, to mammals. Understanding how these effects translate to the human condition is critical as we move deeper into the era of commercial space travel. However, the integration of data, specifically omics data, from astronauts is particularly challenging due to their sensitive nature. OSDR has risen to this challenge by developing a mechanism to control access to identifiable levels of omics data, such as raw sequence data, while enabling public access to processed, unidentifiable, data and associated metadata that will allow the scientific community to interrogate human astronaut data alongside data from model organisms to begin answering these critical questions.

The 2021 SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission collected a comprehensive atlas of biological measurements from four civilian astronauts, providing a wealth of data to characterize the effects of spaceflight on the human body. These data include both non-omics and omics assays such as direct RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single nuclei ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, metagenomics, proteomics, and comprehensive metabolic and cytokine panels, all of which have been integrated into the OSDR system across no less than 9 studies. Each study has been carefully curated using community-backed OSDR standards for sample and assay level metadata ensuring these data are findable and accessible. In addition to hosting both raw and processed data from the principal investigator team for each assay type, the GeneLab team plans to re-process the I4 omics data using GeneLab’s standard processing pipelines. The GeneLab processed data outputs will allow for comparisons across studies on OSDR and enable visualization of these data through the OSDR data visualization platform thereby enabling data reusability and interoperability.

Here we describe the robust privacy and security protocols implemented by OSDR to safeguard sensitive health data from astronauts while facilitating metadata and processed data sharing for research purposes. We further provide a road map for navigating the vast amount of data provided for each I4 study on the OSDR, including experimental design, associated experiments, payloads, and missions, data generation and analysis protocols, and associated scientific articles. Additionally, we illustrate how to interrogate the standardized metadata provided in the sample and assay tables as well as instructions for how to download and access the data.

20180007048,ABSTRACT,Demonstrating Capabilities for Mars Exploration on the Moon,"[""Christopher Moore""]","The U.S. Space Policy Directive of 2017 calls for the United States to lead the return of humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and utilization, followed by human missions to Mars. In 2019, the National Space Council gave NASA a goal to land humans at the south pole of the Moon in 2024. To achieve these goals, NASA’s Exploration Campaign Strategy involves the International Space Station (ISS) to investigate the effects of long-duration spaceflight on human health and performance, a crew-tended Gateway in lunar orbit to demonstrate deep space operations, initial robotic missions to the Moon followed by human missions, and robotic precursor missions to Mars to characterize environments and resources. A huge jump in current capabilities is required to land humans on Mars. These include landing large payloads, surface habitation, extra-vehicular activity (EVA) and crew mobility systems, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), and ascent from Mars to return the crew to Earth. Many of these needed capabilities could be tested on the Moon to reduce the risk for Mars missions. There are a few challenges, however, in extrapolating from capability demonstrations on the Moon to enabling Mars missions such as greater remoteness, the Mars atmosphere, different gravity levels, and planetary protection. Key technology development activities, concepts for early demonstration of the required capabilities on the Moon, and potential areas for commercial and international partnerships will be discussed.","[{""submissionId"":20180007048,""isbn"":""9781510881655"",""publisher"":""International Astronautical Federation (IAF)"",""id"":""7ed2a7658b6e46a9bf9e6c380e8239d6"",""publicationName"":""69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC 2018)"",""publicationDate"":""2018-10-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""DE"",""submissionId"":20180007048,""endDate"":""2018-10-05T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""ab2f731624744ec49d4a31992566d6c2"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Astronautical Federation (IAF)"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""a80bf374354b4dfda3fdb68575cba3b1"",""id"":""2ef440819cba4d0898c9484dc6f2aaca""}],""name"":""69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC)"",""location"":""Bremen"",""id"":""a80bf374354b4dfda3fdb68575cba3b1"",""startDate"":""2018-10-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Lunar And Planetary Science And Exploration""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180007048
20040089243,REPRINT,Medical and surgical applications of space biosensor technology,"[""Hines, J. W.""]","Researchers in space life sciences are rapidly approaching a technology impasse. Many of the critical questions on the impact of spaceflight on living systems simply cannot be answered with the limited available technologies. Research subjects, particularly small animal models like the rat, must be allowed to function relatively untended and unrestrained for long periods to fully reflect the impact of microgravity and spaceflight on their behavior and physiology. These requirements preclude the use of present hard-wired instrumentation techniques and limited data acquisition systems. Implantable sensors and miniaturized biotelemetry are the only means of capturing the fundamental and critical data. This same biosensor and biotelemetry technology has direct application to Earth-based medicine and surgery. Continuous, on-line data acquisition and improved measurement capabilities combined with the ease and flexibility offered by automated, wireless, and portable instruments and data systems, should provide a boon to the health care industry. Playing a key role in this technology revolution is the Sensors 2000! (S2K!) Program at NASA Ames Research Center. S2K!, in collaboration with space life sciences researchers and managers, provides an integrated capability for sensor technology development and applications, including advanced biosensor technology development, spaceflight hardware development, and technology transfer and commercialization. S2K! is presently collaborating on several spaceflight projects with dual-use medical applications. One prime example is a collaboration with the Fetal Treatment Center (FTC) at the University of California at San Francisco. The goal is to develop and apply implantable chemical sensor and biotelemetry technology to continuously monitor fetal patients during extra-uterine surgery, replacement into the womb, through birth and beyond.

L.""]","The capability to grow nutritious, palatable food for crew consumption during spaceflight has the potential to provide health-promoting, bioavailable nutrients, enhance the dietary experience, and reduce launch mass as we move toward longer-duration missions. Studies of edible produce during spaceflight have been limited, leaving a significant knowledge gap in the methods required to grow safe, acceptable, nutritious crops for consumption in space. Researchers from Kennedy Space Center, Johnson Space Center, Purdue University and ORBITEC have teamed up to explore the potential for plant growth and food production on the International Space Station (ISS) and future exploration missions. Ground testing of Chinese cabbage and dwarf tomato crops under different LED lighting and fertilizer conditions is being conducted to allow for a preliminary down selection of the two best lighting recipes and the best fertilizer treatment. Two trials of Chinese cabbage and one trial on dwarf tomato have been completed in on-going ground tests. Horticultural data on crop growth and productivity and chemical data on specific nutrients have been collected and are being analyzed to allow preliminary down selection. Taste test evaluations are planned on the preliminary down selection treatments to allow a final down selection for flight testing. Microbial assessment for hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP) evaluation is also underway to enable implementation of food consumption. Following down selection flight preparation will commence for testing these crops in the Veggie vegetable-production system on the ISS. A crew questionnaire has been developed to better understand the impact of crop growth in Veggie on crew behavioral health. A single Veggie plant growth chamber is currently installed on ISS, and preparations are underway to launch a second Veggie, allowing side-by-side testing under different lighting conditions. Veg-04 will be the first mission that will use this dual-Veggie capability, where the selected cultivar of Tokyo bekana Chinese cabbage will be grown under two different red-to-blue light ratios. ORBITEC has developed custom lighting software allowing independent selection of red and blue light levels. The VEG-05 experiment will test similar light treatments using Red Robin dwarf tomato. These tests offer an opportunity to develop a pick-and-eat fresh vegetable component to the ISS food system as a first step to regular supplemental food production. Our work will help define light colors, levels, and horticultural best practices to achieve high yields of safe, nutritious leafy greens and tomatoes to supplement a space diet of prepackaged food. With this work we will continue the synergistic research to help close gaps in the human research roadmap, and enable humans to venture to Mars and beyond. This research was co-funded by the Human Research Program and Space Biology (MTL1075) in the ILSRA 2015 NRA call.","[{""submissionId"":20170000755,""id"":""c3e88281202545be8e5a1c4f52906f9a"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170000755,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""71f745ef21364dc3ac792df2cf431aec"",""id"":""cea9d2a4989b4179b8931483e5ddae5e""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2017)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""71f745ef21364dc3ac792df2cf431aec"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNK11EA08C"",""NNX15AN78G"",""NNX15AR74G"",""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170000755

In a collaborative effort between the NASA and JAXA space agencies, we are testing whether an antiresorptive drug would provide additional benefit to in-flight exercise to ameliorate bone loss and hypercalciuria during long-duration spaceflight. Measurements of bone loss include DXA, QCT, pQCT, urinary and blood biomarkers. We have completed analysis of R+1year data from 7 crewmembers treated with alendronate during flight, as well as immediate post flight (R+<2wks) data from 6 of 10 concurrent controls without treatment. The treated astronauts used the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) during their missions. The purpose of this report is twofold: 1) to report the results of inflight, post flight and one year post flight bone measures compared with available controls with and without the use of ARED; and 2) to discuss preliminary data on concurrent controls. The figure below compares the BMD changes in ISS crewmembers exercising with and without the current ARED protocol and the alendronate treated crewmembers also using the ARED. This shows that the use of ARED prevents about half the bone loss seen in early ISS crewmembers and that the addition of an antiresorptive provides additional benefit. Resorption markers and urinary Ca excretion are not impacted by exercise alone but are significantly reduced with antiresorptive treatment. Bone measures for treated subjects, 1 year after return from space remain at or near baseline. DXA data for the 6 concurrent controls using the ARED device are similar to DXA data shown in the figure below. QCT data for these six indicate that the integral data are consistent with the DXA data, i.e., comparing the two control groups suggests significant but incomplete improvement in maintaining BMD using the ARED protocol. Biochemical data of the concurrent control group await sample return and analysis. The preliminary conclusion is that an antiresorptive may be an effective adjunct to exercise during long-duration spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":20140014060,""id"":""c9a940ab894b427ba94f32986d2cfdb1"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140014060,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""b18315d1f5ac429aaccdf3585034de1c""},{""submissionId"":20140014060,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""d7decf3589e649039c3f00918807f8e3""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140014060,""endDate"":""2015-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b4416e1aa934464da125de788d78f054"",""id"":""c568a3116b624abf8dfdd043add70b38""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b4416e1aa934464da125de788d78f054"",""id"":""e29b33bb19d545d887ff400dd7d19ffd""}],""name"":""2015 Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2015)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""b4416e1aa934464da125de788d78f054"",""startDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140014060

Mark Settles"",""John Hogan""]","Long duration deep space missions pose a significant challenge when considering adequate nutrition for human spaceflight. Many micronutrients supplied in pre-packaged foods for low Earth orbit flights have a short shelf life and will degrade over multi-year missions. One strategy to mitigate the risk of micronutrient malnutrition is to grow fresh foods to supplement a pre-packaged diet. The BioNutrients project aims to develop systems for growing edible microorganisms that are genetically engineered to produce short shelf life micronutrients. BioNutrients-1 (BN-1) is a five-year spaceflight project currently underway on the International Space Station (ISS) that tests long-term storage and production of two carotenoids, β-carotene and zeaxanthin, in genetically engineered yeast strains. BN-1 on-orbit and ground control activities indicate that the nutrient production system will be stable for at least two years in ambient storage conditions. BN-1 is also testing the effects of long-term ISS storage on viability and gene expression using “stasis packs” containing a series of microorganisms useful in food and biomanufacturing processes. Stasis pack analysis is distinguishing microorganisms with full viability after two years of storage from other species that lose viability rapidly. In parallel, BioNutrients-2 (BN-2) is being developed as a six-month flight experiment that will expand the range of foods produced on ISS to include yogurt, kefir, and probiotic yeast. BN-2 will improve upon hardware design by transitioning from a hard-shell polycarbonate bioreactor to a flexible fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) bag. This change reduces the mass and volume required to store production packs. The long-term goal of BioNutrients is to develop the capability for rapid and safe delivery of multiple micronutrients in single-use production packs. We expect synthetic biology approaches similar to BioNutrients will play an important role for astronaut health in future NASA missions to the Moon and Mars.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20210016184,""endDate"":""2021-11-06T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""fd8e63d8a67044ce81c681e70faedb93"",""id"":""099f1ae2e5cf47509952286a33dcf67b""}],""name"":""37th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Baltimore, MD"",""id"":""fd8e63d8a67044ce81c681e70faedb93"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2021-meeting/"",""startDate"":""2021-11-03T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""596118.04.25.21.03""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210016184

BACKGROUND: NASA embarked on the Commercial Crew Program to launch astronauts into low-earth orbit from US soil and dock with the International Space Station (ISS).  The eventual industry providers selected were SpaceX (SpX) and Boeing.  These commercial transportation systems are vital to ensure crew availability on ISS for research and discovery.

 OVERVIEW: NASA/SpaceX Demo-2 (DM2) mission launched from the Kennedy Space Center in 2020 as the historic first crewed test-flight of the Crew Dragon spacecraft with two NASA Astronauts onboard. DM2 represented the first flight in 9-years from US soil since STS-135 in 2011. The 63-day mission ended with splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, the first US water recovery in 45-years since Apollo-Soyuz.  Validation of system hardware and operations allowed four-person crews to launch on subsequently missions (Crew-1, Crew-2, Crew-3, Crew-4, Crew-5 to date), which included International Partner crewmembers.                  

DISCUSSION: A multitude of operational, training, medical, and technical issues needed to be addressed between NASA Medical Operations, the commercial provider SpaceX, and the Department of Defense. These included Flight rule development, occupant protection, pressurized suit testing, communication plans during mission phases, and emergency simulations for supporting Flight Surgeons and Biomedical Engineers.  In providing crew experience with expected launch and entry G-force profile, Centrifuge training was established. Preventive health measures via the Health Stabilization Program were especially vital during the global COVID-19 pandemic.  Unique aspects arise for SpX Dragon parachute splashdown and shipboard recovery operations in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. The new Commercial Crew Program is indeed a wonderfully challenging and exciting era for human spaceflight.

20110018183,ABSTRACT,Mission Possible: BioMedical Experiments on the Space Shuttle,"[""Bopp, E."",""Kreutzberg, K.""]","Biomedical research, both applied and basic, was conducted on every Shuttle mission from 1981 to 2011. The Space Shuttle Program enabled NASA investigators and researchers from around the world to address fundamental issues concerning living and working effectively in space. Operationally focused occupational health investigations and tests were given priority by the Shuttle crew and Shuttle Program management for the resolution of acute health issues caused by the rigors of spaceflight. The challenges of research on the Shuttle included: limited up and return mass, limited power, limited crew time, and requirements for containment of hazards. The sheer capacity of the Shuttle for crew and equipment was unsurpassed by any other launch and entry vehicle and the Shuttle Program provided more opportunity for human research than any program before or since. To take advantage of this opportunity, life sciences research programs learned how to: streamline the complicated process of integrating experiments aboard the Shuttle, design experiments and hardware within operational constraints, and integrate requirements between different experiments and with operational countermeasures. We learned how to take advantage of commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and developed a hardware certification process with the flexibility to allow for design changes between flights. We learned the importance of end-to-end testing for experiment hardware with humans-in-the-loop. Most importantly, we learned that the Shuttle Program provided an excellent platform for conducting human research and for developing the systems that are now used to optimize research on the International Space Station. This presentation will include a review of the types of experiments and medical tests flown on the Shuttle and the processes that were used to manifest and conduct the experiments.

A team was assembled at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) to help navigate the shifting COVID-19 pandemic. Their goal was to mitigate the impact of COVID on astronauts, other essential personnel, and the human spaceflight program. This team supplemented the JSC Pandemic Incident Response Group, whose function is to set policy for the overall management of JSC’s COVID-19 mitigations for all onsite mission-essential and mission-critical activities, including health policy.

Context

The first mission to return to Earth from the International Space Station at the start of the pandemic returned when there was limited information about the transmission and prevention of COVID-19. The medical leadership at JSC determined that a dedicated team was required to navigate the uncharted waters of the pandemic.

Description of Activities

Issues tackled by this panel included: prevention of COVID-19 transmission during altitude, dive, and spacecraft training – activities that require prolonged close contact between multiple individuals who often cannot safely wear face masks; mitigating the risks of domestic and international travel for essential personnel; securing COVID-19 testing from local and foreign hospital systems; acquiring antigen and PCR analyzers for in-house testing; and the development of quarantine policies for crewed spacecraft launches and landings in Kazakhstan and the United States.

20205008737,PRESENTATION,Clinical Decision Support - Concepts of Operation,"[""B. Russell"",""M. Krihak"",""S. Shetye"",""K. Martin"",""T. Shaw""]","We are entering a new era in space exploration to return to the moon and explore Mars. Crew members operating independently during long duration space exploration missions will require a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to increase autonomy by augmenting their knowledge, skills and abilities in different scenarios.  Significant changes to in-flight and habitat medical care due to constraints on mass, volume, power, crew time and medical evacuation capabilities are needed to increase crew autonomy and self-reliance in decision making and task performance.  The Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element of the Human Research Program (HRP) pushes the boundary of space medical systems to advance the care of astronauts on future exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit by identifying and testing next-generation medical care and crew health maintenance technologies. 
Clinical decision support (CDS) presents knowledge and data in a context aware manner to augment a crew members’ knowledge, skills and abilities during the process of observation, orientation, decisions and action. A comprehensive crew health and performance CDSS is required to augment crew capability and will be used in different scenarios for several reasons. In general, the CDSS’s role is to assist the crew in prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment of crew health and performance related conditions that may arise in exploration spaceflight. For example, CDSS would assist a high acuity scenario such as a heart attack by supplying clear instructions, vital signs and treatment reminders. A lower severity scenario such as kidney stone risk could interface to vehicle systems and display more complex predictive data during a diagnosis. A CDSS needs to contribute to successful missions by maintaining a high performing crew who can potentially exhibit countless medical conditions related to derangements from the space environment (sleep, cognition, nutrition and exercise) as well as conditions intrinsic to humans anywhere. While supporting the crew’s ability to make sound clinical decisions is desirable in any mission, it is essential for exploration missions with significant communication delays, no evacuation capability, and extended exposure to the flight environment. Such missions correspond with medical Level of Care V (LOC V), the highest level specified in NASA-STD-3001.  The project focuses on CDS implementation research to derive requirements for LOC V, where the need for increased autonomy results in new practices and the inclusion of non-clinical data, such as vehicle environmental measures and physical exercise results, from other human and vehicle domains and advanced analytics.  
The CDS project describes how the CDSS is intended to be used by defining concepts of operations (ConOps). The process to derive ConOps focuses on increased autonomy that reduces the likelihood and consequences of accepted medical conditions. These crew health and performance inputs are grouped by common datasets and analysis models. Use cases are derived to research new clinical scenarios, architectural development and workflows. Implementation research is conducted with protypes to inform assumptions and derive requirements. The project also establishes how externally developed analysis and approaches can be added to expand a clinical decision support system and thus highlight how a comprehensive system can be globally developed with collaborators. 
This presentation will cover example scenarios from the CDS ConOps and the method to derive them. One example scenario will be CDSS alerting an increased kidney stone risk during a mission, with diagnosis and treatment options provided during the intervention.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20205008737,""endDate"":""2021-02-04T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA HRP""}},""meetingId"":""44232192daab45f48165405950f44b65"",""id"":""4f8eeecb22ea406980a8030c4fe0a3b9""}],""name"":""2021 Human Research Program Investigators' Workshop"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""44232192daab45f48165405950f44b65"",""url"":""http://www.cvent.com/events/2020-nasa-human-research-program-investigators-workshop/event-summary-bf18acec0c834f7782f48d805a60a43f.aspx?i=ed90f36f-d6bd-4364-b63a-a8058eabe9d5"",""startDate"":""2021-02-01T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205008737

As the gravitational force increases or decreases, the cell function responds in a linear fashion. This poses significant health risks for astronauts in long-term spaceflight. The application of light therapy with the use of NASA LEDs will significantly improve the medical care that is available to astronauts on long-term space missions. NASA LEDs stimulate the basic energy processes in the mitochondria (energy compartments) of each cell, particularly when near-infrared light is used to activate the color sensitive chemicals (chromophores, cytochrome systems) inside. Optimal LED wavelengths include 680, 730 and 880 nm and our laboratory has improved the healing of wounds in laboratory animals by using both NASA LED light and hyperbaric oxygen. Furthermore, DNA synthesis in fibroblasts and muscle cells has been quintupled using NASA LED light alone, in a single application combining 680, 730 and 880 nm each at 4 Joules per centimeter squared. Muscle and bone atrophy are well documented in astronauts, and various minor injuries occurring in space have been reported not to heal until landing on Earth. An LED blanket device may be used for the prevention of bone and muscle atrophy in astronauts.

Airborne particles, also called aerosols, can cause human health problems ranging from mild respiratory discomfort to more severe disease. NASA’s suspended cabin particle and Lunar dust concentration requirements are motivated by protecting crew health and comfort during spaceflight, especially as mission durations lengthen and become increasingly ground-independent. Spacecraft cabin aerosols can originate from a variety of sources, including skin flakes, fibers from clothes and other materials, mechanical wear from equipment, and personal care products (e.g., antiperspirant). As NASA plans future expeditions to the Moon and Mars, Lunar and planetary dust compose an additional, under-characterized source for airborne particles. In addition to these known sources, recent studies on ISS cabin aerosols also revealed particles with unknown origins and poorly understood formation mechanisms, including some that may be formed by oxidative and/or heterogeneous chemical processes. The aerosol monitors payload, to be launched February 2025, will focus on understanding these unknown sources and processes, as well as demonstrating novel technologies for particulate monitoring to be infused in future space flight programs. In this presentation, we will present our knowledge of spacecraft cabin aerosols to date, summarizing aerosol measurement experiments from Shuttle through ISS. Cabin aerosol sources, known and unknown, will be summarized, and knowledge gaps for future long-duration space exploration missions will be discussed.

20110023257,ABSTRACT,"Developing a Habitat for Long Duration, Deep Space Missions","[""Rucker, Michelle A."",""Thompson, Shelby""]","One possible next leap in human space exploration is a mission to a near Earth asteroid (NEA). In order to achieve such an ambitious goal, a space habitat will need to be designed to accommodate a crew of four for the 380-day round trip. The Human Spaceflight Architecture Team (HAT) developed a conceptual design for such a habitat. The team identified activities that would be performed inside a long-duration, deep space habitat, and the capabilities needed to support such a mission. A list of seven functional activities/capabilities was developed: individual and group crew care, spacecraft and mission operations, subsystem equipment, logistics and resupply, and contingency operations. The volume for each activity was determined using NASA STD-3001 and the companion Human Integration Design Handbook (HIDH). Although, the sum of these volumes produced an over-sized spacecraft, the team evaluated activity frequency and duration to identify functions that could share a common volume without conflict, reducing the total volume by 24%. After adding 10% for growth, the resulting functional pressurized volume was calculated to be 268 m3 distributed over the functions. The work was validated through comparison with the International Space Station (ISS), Bigelow Aerospace s proposed habitat module, and NASA s Trans-Hab concepts. In the end, the team developed an internal layout that (a) minimized the transit time between related crew stations, (b) accommodated expected levels of activity at each station, (c) isolated stations when necessary for health, safety, performance, and privacy, and (d) provided a safe, efficient, and comfortable work and living environment.","[{""submissionId"":20110023257,""id"":""5a770743ddad47a28b55aa33b1c9f144"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20110023257,""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""Reston, VA, United States"",""id"":""fce2987d47e04b5d96c89e90c71f77c7""},{""submissionId"":20110023257,""name"":""International Astronautical Federation"",""location"":""Paris, France"",""id"":""bc56803890dd4e88a9078042738a65dd""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110023257,""endDate"":""2012-05-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""Reston, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""97eeae24da94444099150f1c29e80a03"",""id"":""a24a5dc3ca9a44e4bdf0e32bdfb99399""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Astronautical Federation"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""97eeae24da94444099150f1c29e80a03"",""id"":""01810d6914264587a8759fd7dd301210""}],""name"":""2012 Global Space Exploration Conference (GLEX)"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""97eeae24da94444099150f1c29e80a03"",""startDate"":""2012-05-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110023257

The difference between spaceflight proven capabilities and those needed for future exploration architectures is defined as a capability gap.  Capability gaps are not technology specific.  Each capability gap may be closed with a wide array of technologies that have unique benefits and challenges.  Determining what a capability’s relevant and distinguishing key performance parameters (KPPs) are for a mission is critical.  Mass, power, and volume are always constrained and important, but defining these in a way normalized by performance is very important.  KPP definition for reliability, dormancy, and integration needs are hard to define but critical. Outside of technical considerations, the programmatic factors of the estimated time to develop the technology vs when a mission element is also a strong consideration in which technologies should be pursued.  The Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLSS) capability areas include: life support, environmental monitoring, fire safety, and logistics.  These capability areas are decomposed to high level gaps. While KPPs should  be technology agnostic, they can be used to both compare technologies and measure progress of technology development over time.  KPPs help define when the gap is closed, and the core mission objectives can be accomplished.  Proposed technology improvements to enhance a capability should balance improved KPPs and against investments in other capabilities that are not yet closed.

Astronauts experience postflight disturbances in postural and locomotor control due to sensorimotor adaptations during spaceflight. These alterations may have adverse consequences if a rapid egress is required after landing. Although exercise is partially effective for mitigating cardiovascular and muscular deconditioning, additional countermeasures are needed to further preserve sensorimotor function for exploration missions. We have identified proprioceptive training and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) as promising in-flight countermeasures. Since prolonged head down bed rest (HDBR) is a spaceflight analog for body unloading and causes postural and locomotor control decrements that parallel those observed after spaceflight, it can be used to accelerate the development of these countermeasures. 

METHODS
This study will determine the effects of proprioceptive training and EMS on functional task performance and sensorimotor function following 60 days of 6° HDBR. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) an EMS arm, 2) a proprioceptive training arm, 3) an exercise plus proprioceptive training arm, and 4) a control arm. The EMS countermeasure will include daily bilateral stimulation of the quadriceps femoris muscle (30 minutes per session). Proprioceptive training will be performed three days per week (20 minutes per session) consisting of body-loaded postural tasks in the horizontal position on an air bearing sled. Exercise training will mimic current protocols used on the International Space Station, but treadmill aerobic exercise will be replaced with additional cycling aerobic exercise. Primary outcome measures will include pre and post HDBR functional tests that are representative of high priority exploration mission tasks and require high demand for dynamic control of postural stability. Additional measures will be used to identify the key physiological factors contributing to countermeasure benefits. Given the constrained samples size, a Bayesian modelling approach will be used to quantify the probability that there is an effect of a given magnitude.

COUNTERMEASURE UPDATES
Proprioceptive countermeasure design enhancements and human in the loop pilot testing continued through the Crew Health Countermeasures (CHC) Systems Capability Leadership Team (SCLT). The primary goals of this work were to enhance the visual feedback system’s capabilities and develop a proprioceptive training program for 60 days of HDBR. Six healthy non-astronaut volunteers participated in four pilot training sessions to systematically examine how each training variable (e.g., axial load, foot placement, and software profile) affects the overall proprioceptive challenge. The resulting training program will maintain an appropriate challenge during 60 days of HDBR by progressively decreasing the subject’s base of support, increasing tilt board target distances, and increasing axial loads using both subjective verbal feedback and objective performance data. 

RELEVANCE
The deliverable from this project will be proof-of-concept sensorimotor countermeasure designs for functional task performance with full assessment of efficacy in a spaceflight analog. If the countermeasures are effective, they will be translated for validation with the suite of operationally implemented in-flight countermeasures.

20250000099,POSTER,Custom Integration of Multiple Medical Functionalities,"[""B E Lewandowski"",""C A Haddix"",""A A Nelson"",""C M Schkurko""]","<b>INTRODUCTION:</b>
Previous spaceflight experience and results from probabilistic risk assessment of spaceflight medical risk have highlighted the need for vital sign measurements, medical scopes, and clinical imaging tools for managing medical conditions during spaceflight. The Human Research Program’s Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element and the Mars Campaign Office’s Exploration Medical Integrated Product Team (XMIPT) have performed ground-based evaluations of two Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) Multi-functional Integrated Medical (MIM) devices, which integrate various medical capabilities together in one device. The key findings from these evaluations are presented in a complementary presentation, leaving this presentation to focus on forward recommendations for customized integration of multiple medical functionalities. 

<b>KEY COMPONENTS:</b>
The key features of a custom integration of multiple medical functionalities includes devices and capabilities that optimally reduce medical risk. The COTS MIM devices incorporated functionality for best supporting Earth-based, emergency, pre-hospital care. Our custom integration will use probabilistic risk assessment tools, such as the Medical Extensible Dynamic Probabilistic Risk Assessment Tool (MEDPRAT), to determine the optimal functionality to include based on medical risk minimization. An additional feature of custom integration includes the ability to adapt to different requirements within different vehicles and/or missions. The COTS MIM devices store data in patient specific records, however, the format of the records is not modifiable, and data are not easily transferred from the MIM device to a central data architecture outside of the manufacturer’s established system. Our concept for custom integration will use devices that have an open application programming interface, which can easily connect to independent data architectures and third-party visualization software. The ultrasound capabilities included within the COTS MIM devices did not satisfy many of the Artemis Research and Operations Working Group’s ultrasound functional needs, and therefore, incorporation of higher quality ultrasound capabilities within a customized integration will be beneficial. The COTS MIM devices included minimal procedural guidance and clinical decision support tools. Supplemental tools of this type would need to be supplied along with the COTS MIM devices if they were to be used operationally, so another advantage of customization is the ability to integrate these support tools along with the medical functionality, for a more streamlined user experience. 

<b>CONCLUSION:</b> 
Investigation of a customized integration of medical functionality provides a method for further understanding the needs of a long-term exploration spaceflight medical system. The crew members of these exploration missions will need to operate more and more independently from Earth-based ground support. Therefore, having an optimized, streamlined medical system, which contains the functionality and supporting information needed, while remaining within mission and vehicle constraints, will help to maintain crew health and performance, which is necessary for achieving high levels of mission success.

However, ISS has not been as suitable for research on other hazards of human spaceflight such as isolation and communications delay. NASA recently completed a special assessment of whether modifications could be made to operations or facilities so that ISS could be used more effectively as an analog to simulate long-duration crew missions beyond low earth orbit. A cross-disciplinary team met to identify concept of operations, trade spaces, challenges, and opportunities to making ISS more operationally relevant as a Mars transit mission analog, and the results and implementation plans are summarized in this manuscript. In addition to the use case of 12-month missions (already in planning by the NASA ISS Program to bound expected Mars transit durations), three new use cases where ISS could provide valuable high-fidelity experience were identified. (1) Testing of operations procedures and medical care could be enhanced by demonstrating crew handling a simulated medical event in microgravity, autonomously, and with significant communications delay. (2) Isolation and confinement effects of deep space transit could be studied on ISS to validate current habitable volume requirements for Mars transit as well as provide context for evaluating the results of the extensive ground-based simulations in HERA and NEK. A trade study of possible operational and hardware changes that would make ISS applicable to these use cases was completed. (3) Surface operations after the physiological deconditioning of a long transit could be conducted to validate crew ability to perform critical ground tasks after 6-month Mars transit and aid in conceptual design of Mars surface element architectures. Each of the case studies includes a trade space between operational impacts on nominal ISS activities and degree of fidelity. A phased approach to implementation means that several ""quick start"" activities can be done in 2019-2020 at the same time as planning continues for more complex exploration analog options beginning as early as 2022. The team determined that many of these quick-start tasks could be done with available assets, entirely independent of other exploration system development timelines (such as Orion, Space Launch System). The consideration of the full suite of human spaceflight capabilities in the lunar vicinity can also be included as each step in human exploration serves as a simulation opportunity for some aspect of subsequent missions. Further discussions of options with the international community are critical for considering the benefits as well as impacts of simulation activities on ISS, as well as to better formulate future mission architectures.

In the event of an ESPE, the current ISS trajectory ensures that the vehicle is only traveling through fields of higher radiation exposure for a brief period of time; the Earth’s geomagnetic field prevents the penetration of the high-energy particles of concern throughout the majority of the orbit. Exo-LEO missions, on the other hand, require that the vehicle travel through free space, exposing vehicle and crew to the full impact of the ESPE. NASA has combined multiple approaches to resolve this radiation exposure issue. New vehicles are designed to take advantage of advances in particle transport modeling capabilities and shielding technology, allowing redistribution of mass throughout the vehicle to areas of thinner shielding when the energetic particle flux has increased to levels of concern. Although vehicle shielding is an important aspect of radiation exposure protection, there is a continued requirement to monitor and predict the space weather environment. To this end, SRAG maintains a console position in Mission Control with 24/7 mission support capability. In the event of increased solar activity, SRAG collaborates with the Flight Control Team (FCT) to determine if crew action (i.e., shelter) is required. During any increase in solar activity, the FCT needs three pieces of information to effectively decide the crew response in light of other required mission tasks: if an event (ESPE) will occur, how ‘intense’ an observed event will be, and how long will an observed event will last. An ideal alert system limits false alarms, therefore causing the crew to take action unnecessarily, without ignoring events that pose a hazard to the crew. SRAG’s current operational concept for ISS missions focuses on short-term forecasts, best described as ‘now-casting’. Console operators are in daily communication with the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) for situational awareness purposes. When conditions exist that may lead to increased solar activity, operators receive notifications from SWPC. In the case of a well-connected ESPE, the console operator may only have on the order of minutes to several hours to notify the FCT of the event and provide a recommendation for crew action. As NASA shifts to exo-LEO missions, the increased time in free space as well as the reduced ability to communicate with the crew will force a transition in crew protection strategy that emphasizes improvments to both the accuracy and the lead time in forecasting capabilities.","[{""submissionId"":20190025247,""id"":""c3d84d464f6b486b8fbe32b3a0769d8b"",""publicationDate"":""2019-05-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190025247,""endDate"":""2019-05-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""547e9fce9d964286b27ebd557d3fab3f"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI)"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""98259514e4c94568bbe51fbcc600cfc6"",""id"":""4c0827f193044ebd89813e7b446495ff""}],""name"":""Applied Space Environments Conference"",""location"":""Los Angeles, CA"",""id"":""98259514e4c94568bbe51fbcc600cfc6"",""startDate"":""2019-05-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Space Radiation""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190025247
20190001169,OTHER,Variable Vector Countermeasure Suit (V2Suit) for Space Habitation and Exploration,"[""Duda, Kevin R."",""West, John J."",""Newman, Dava J."",""Middleton, Akil J."",""Jacobs, Shane E."",""Vasquez, Rebecca"",""Hansberry, Mitchell""]","The Variable Vector Countermeasure Suit (V2Suit) for Space Habitation and Exploration is a visionary system concept that will revolutionize space missions by providing a platform for integrating sensors and actuators with daily astronaut intravehicular activities to improve human health and performance. The V2Suit uses control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) within a miniaturized module placed on body segments to provide a viscous resistance during movements _ a countermeasure to the sensorimotor and musculoskeletal adaptation performance decrements that manifest themselves while living and working in microgravity and during gravitational transitions during long-duration spaceflight, including post-flight recovery and rehabilitation. Through an integrated design, system initialization, and control systems approach the V2Suit is capable of generating this viscous resistance along an arbitrarily specified direction of down. When movements are made, for example, parallel to that down direction a resistance is applied, and when the movement is perpendicular to that direction no resistance is applied. The V2Suit proposes to be a countermeasure to this spaceflight-related adaptation and de-conditioning and the unique sensorimotor characteristics associated with living and working in 0-G, which are critical for future long-duration space missions. This NIAC Phase II project leveraged the study results from Phase I and focused on detailing several aspects of the V2Suit concept, including a wearable CMG architecture, control steering laws, human-system integration evaluations, developing a brassboard prototype unit as a proof-of-concept, as well as evaluating the concept in the context of future space exploration missions. A human mission to Mars, such as that outlined in the Mars Design Reference Architecture 5.0, provides a framework for determining the concept of operations and requirements for the V2Suit system. Mars DRA 5.0 includes approximately 180 day 0-G transits to- and from- Mars, as well as a 500 day stay on the surface (~3/8-G) (Figure 3). Accordingly, there are four gravitational transitions associated with this mission: 1-G to 0-G (Earth launch), 0-G to 3/8-G (Mars landing), 3/8-G to 0-G (Mars launch), and 0-G to 1-G (Earth landing). This reference mission provided the basis for developing high-level operational requirements to guide the subsequent study and design of the key V2Suit components.","[{""submissionId"":20190001169,""id"":""7f45675b60f14b89bb930db2c298c366"",""publicationDate"":""2014-08-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190001169

Scott"",""Danielle K. Lopez"",""Amanda Saravia-Butler"",""Lauren M. Sanders"",""Samrawit G. Gebre"",""Sylvain V. Costes""]","Increased biomedical risks and challenges associated with deep space missions require new knowledge discovery, new health countermeasures, and development of novel ecosystems, life support, crop production, and biomedical support capabilities. To meet NASA’s Moon to Mars strategic program goals for Human and Biological Sciences, findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR), and maximally open-access data is going to be required to enable humanity to thrive in deep space. Indeed, this cornerstone perspective on FAIR and maximally open access data was also recommended in the recent 2023-2032 Decadal Survey from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 

The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) is a maximally open access and FAIR database, and meets various scientific, technical, and operational spaceflight needs. It offers public users and submitters the ability to upload, download, search, share, analyze, and visualize data across ‘omics, physiological, phenotypic, behavioral, bioimaging, video, and environmental monitoring telemetry datasets. OSDR includes NASA GeneLab, NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive, and the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection. OSDR has >455 studies with datasets from model organisms and non-NASA human astronauts. There are ~12 datasets from the Inspiration 4 (I4) mission, spanning metagenomics, comprehensive metabolic panels, clonal hematopoiesis, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and cytokine panels. In the interest of data privacy, two I4 datasets have raw FASTQ and FASTA files relating to the epitranscriptome, and a new request feature is live in OSDR (with a backend review process established) which was developed based on industry norms. OSDR also recently began a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) to scientifically curate and make available >200 terabytes of human and model organism space-relevant data. The OSDR submission portal is designed to ingest and curate ~25 ‘omics assay data types, and ~50 physiological-phenotypic-imaging assay data types, spanning ultrasonography, micro-computed tomography, histology, morphometric photography, rebound tonometry, gait analysis, optical coherence tomography, novel object recognition, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. 

A suite of analysis tools are available for OSDR users including: 1) an Environmental Data Application to compare radiation, CO2, relative humidity, temperature, and other telemetry across missions and subjects, 2) the RadLab database, a collaboration between NASA, ESA, the German and Italian Space Agencies, and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, which compiles radiation measurements relevant to human spaceflight and provides tools for accessing and manipulating the data, and 3) a Multi-study visualization tool which enables users to look across and combine GeneLab’s omics datasets across different experiments and missions.

There are ~600 volunteer OSDR Analysis Working Group (AWG) members who: 1) provide feedback on scientific standards for reuse (subject and assay metadata; processing pipelines; dataset formats and uniformed structures for machine-readability), and 2) collaborate to mine-reuse OSDR data conducting scientific analysis. OSDR has enabled 60 publications as of September 2023, many directly from AWG collaborations most notably the Cell Press package in 2020. Lastly, there are at least 15 articles which mine OSDR data part of a package of ~50 articles across Nature Portfolio with research stemming from I4, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, NASA Space Biology, and the NASA Human Research Program.

20110016708,ABSTRACT,Use It or Lose It: Skeletal Muscle Function and Performance Results from Space Shuttle,"[""Ryder, Jeffrey""]","The Space Shuttle Program provided a wealth of valuable information regarding the adaptations of skeletal muscle to weightlessness. Studies conducted during the Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project (EDOMP) represented ground breaking work on the effects of spaceflight on muscle form and function from applied human research to cellular adaptations. Results from detailed supplementary objective (DSO) 477 demonstrated that muscle strength losses could occur rapidly in response to short-duration spaceflight. The effects of spaceflight-induced unloading were primarily restricted to postural muscles such as those of the back as well as the knee extensors. DSO 606 provided evidence from MRI that the observed strength losses were partially accounted for by a reduction in the size of the individual muscles. Muscle biopsy studies conducted during DSO 475 were able to show muscle atrophy in individual muscle fibers from the quadriceps muscles. Reduced quadriceps muscle size and strength was also observed during the 17-d Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission aboard STS-78. Multiple maximal strength tests were conducted in flight on the calf muscles and it has been hypothesized that these high force contractions may have acted as a countermeasure. Muscle fiber mechanics were studied on calf muscle samples pre- and postflight. While some responses were crewmember specific, the general trend was that muscle fiber force production dropped and shortening velocity increased. The increased shortening velocity helped to maintain muscle fiber power. Numerous rodent studies performed during Shuttle missions suggest that many of the effects reported in Shuttle crewmembers could be due to lesions in the cellular signaling pathways that stimulate protein synthesis as well as an increase in the mechanisms that up-regulate protein breakdown. The results have important implications regarding the overall health and performance capabilities of future crewmembers that will venture beyond low-Earth orbit. Learning Objective: Overview of the Space Shuttle Program regarding adaptive changes in skeletal muscle function and performance, including what was learned from research and what was implemented for countermeasures.","[{""submissionId"":20110016708,""id"":""12d1d2dc5bb84a449827429db2c44cc4"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20110016708,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""52eef7ebc1f9431285c50f1f285e6823""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110016708,""endDate"":""2012-05-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""23fcffb802a247128168fefbeb80d063"",""id"":""4395fe963b6e416ea489321ca425814c""}],""name"":""83rd AsMA Annual Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""Atlanta, GA"",""id"":""23fcffb802a247128168fefbeb80d063"",""startDate"":""2012-05-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110016708
20190033172,PRESENTATION,Developing High-Throughput Organ-On-A-Chip Models to Investigate the Effects of Ionizing Radiation on the Central Nervous System,"[""Malkani, Sherina""]","One of the main health risks in human space exploration is central nervous system (CNS) damage by ionizing radiation. Irradiation with simulated GCRs or their components, or high doses of low-LET radiation such as gamma rays, in animal models has been shown to cause neuronal damage together with glial cell activation and neuroinflammation and has been associated with prolonged cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. The extent of CNS damage in response to any insult, including ionizing radiation, is partially regulated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which enables immune cells to enter the CNS. The main cellular regulators of BBB permeability are astrocytes, which also modulate neuronal death, immune responses and oxidative stress, and thus could serve as a robust CNS-specific target for countermeasure development. However, studies on BBB permeability and astrocyte functions in regulating CNS responses to ionizing radiation have been limited, especially in human tissue/organ analogs. Therefore, we have established a high throughput 3D organ-on-a-chip system to study human CNS functions in response to ionizing radiation, with the eventual goal of adapting it to spaceflight missions. We utilized commercially available OrganoPlate system (Mimetas, Inc.) seeded with primary or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human cells for developing 3D neuronal-astrocytic and BBB models. We investigated both immediate and delayed CNS dose responses to 0.5-1 Gy X-rays by measuring BBB permeability and morphology, and astrocyte activation. We have also quantified secreted markers of oxidative stress and cell viability. In the future, we are planning to monitor dendritic, axonal and synaptic changes in neurons, evaluate the combined exposures to simulated microgravity and ionizing radiation, and compare the responses to low and high-LET ionizing radiation. We anticipate these studies could indicate novel cellular and mechanistic targets for countermeasure developments to improve CNS functions in astronauts.","[{""submissionId"":20190033172,""id"":""0ec23e203cfc48048c00a96933a18252"",""publicationDate"":""2019-11-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190033172,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""b77307cdd7dc4c3c8320cf62020b4643""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190033172,""endDate"":""2019-11-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""329edd2de320400187fb7a4e49a5b5c0"",""id"":""dec43f37c7b0434588e44ea05431361d""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""329edd2de320400187fb7a4e49a5b5c0"",""startDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""80NSSC18M0060""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190033172

Tending plants also may serve as a countermeasure for crew psychological stresses associated with long duration spaceflight. However, requirements to support consistent growth of a variety of high quality, nutritious crops under spaceflight environmental conditions is unknown. This study is exploring the potential to grow plants for food production on the International Space Station (ISS) using the Veggie vegetable production system. Ground testing is underway to compare the impacts of several fertilizer and lighting treatments on growth, quality, and nutritional composition of the leafy green crop mizuna, and the dwarf tomato crop Red Robin when subjected to Veggie ISS environmental conditions. Early testing focused on the leafy crop Tokyo Bekana Chinese cabbage, but ground tests indicated that this plant suffered from stress responses when grown under LEDs and the chronically elevated CO2 levels found on the ISS. Mizuna, a related leafy variety that grows well in the presence of high CO2, and has excellent organoleptic characteristics, was selected as an alternate crop. Tomato crops have been grown using two fertilizer formulations and two pollination techniques, and growth tests using different red:blue lighting environments are underway. Chemical analysis is also being conducted and these data, when coupled with the growth results, will be used to down-select to the two best lighting treatments and best fertilizer treatment for future testing of each crop on the ISS. Additionally, seed-source testing has become important, with mizuna seeds from two different vendors growing very differently. A seed source has been selected, and seed-surface-sanitizing methods have been confirmed for mizuna, but these remain under development for tomato. A crop-handling protocol is also being evaluated to support food safety. All harvests reserve a subset of samples for microbial analysis to determine baseline microbial levels and help establish critical control points for food safety. Testing was initially conducted in hardware analogs of the standard Veggie plant pillows. However, a new Veggie watering system, the Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System or PONDS, has been designed and is being prepared for future flight experiments. With the selection of this growth system, ground tests have shifted to analog PONDS systems. Crop tests on ISS, designated VEG-04 for mizuna and VEG-05 for tomato, are planned in 2018 to evaluate any additional impacts of spaceflight on the light and fertilizer conditions down-selected from ground tests. A set of Veggie-specific questions has been developed to characterize the psychological impacts of plant growth and plant-care activities during spaceflight. Organoleptic questionnaires have been developed to assess produce attributes in microgravity taste sessions. These tests for plants growing in the Veggie hardware on ISS will help to mitigate the risk of an inadequate food supply for long duration missions by developing methods and determining hardware requirements to integrate fresh vegetables as a dietary supplement.

20230016062,PRESENTATION,Characterizing the Risk: Review of Sensorimotor Evidence and Research Roadmap,"[""Timothy Ryan Macaulay"",""Scott Jonathan Wood""]","BACKGROUND: 
NASA’s Artemis program will take astronauts back to the lunar surface for the first time in almost 50 years. Despite the successes of the previous Apollo program, the Artemis missions will differ in duration, vehicle characteristics, and landing tasks that may exacerbate the risks to crew health/safety and mission objectives. NASA’s Human Research Program identifies the risk of altered sensorimotor/vestibular function impacting critical mission tasks as one of the top priority risks to lunar exploration missions. This session will review the existing evidence and remaining gaps in knowledge for the sensorimotor risk.

DESCRIPTION: 
Alterations in sensorimotor processing during spaceflight can lead to motion sickness, spatial disorientation, and decrements in postural control, locomotion, and fine motor control during and following gravity-transitions. The risk of impairment is greatest during and soon after gravity-transitions, when performance decrements may have high operational impacts (e.g., manual landings, immediate egress following landing, and early extravehicular activities (EVAs)). Recent studies have specifically improved the risk characterization of changes in perception, motion sickness, postural and locomotor control, manual control, and fine-motor coordination. However, given the difficulty in obtaining measurements during and soon after gravity-transitions, evidence for initial decrements immediately following gravity-transitions remains limited. The most significant gaps in the risk include manual control ability around gravity-transitions, the incidence and severity of motion sickness during landings, and the ability to perform egress/EVAs soon after gravity-transition. To address these gaps, current research roadmaps leverage both spaceflight studies and ground-based analogs for risk characterization and countermeasure development/validation.

DISCUSSION: 
This panel will further describe the current sensorimotor research strategies with an emphasis on the operational scenarios of manual control, crew egress, and EVA. The goal of this research is to accommodate the needs of the crew and facilitate human capabilities to ensure lunar mission success. This work will prepare NASA for successful Artemis missions and enable the next giant leap, the exploration of Mars.

D.""]","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of stress and spaceflight on levels of neuroendocrine hormones and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific antibodies in astronauts. METHODS: Antiviral antibody titers and stress hormones were measured in plasma samples collected from 28 astronauts at their annual medical exam (baseline), 10 days before launch (L-10), landing day (R+0), and 3 days after landing (R+3). Urinary stress hormones were also measured at L-10 and R+0. RESULTS: Significant increases (p <.01) in EBV virus capsid antigen antibodies were found at all three time points (L-10, R+0, and R+3) as compared with baseline samples. Anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibodies were significantly decreased at L-10 (p <.05) and continued to decrease after spaceflight (R+0 and R+3, p <.01). No changes were found in antibodies to the nonlatent measles virus. The 11 astronauts who showed evidence of EBV reactivation had significant increases in urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine as compared with astronauts without EBV reactivation. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that physical and psychological stresses associated with spaceflight resulted in decreased virus-specific T-cell immunity and reactivation of EBV.","[{""volume"":""63"",""submissionId"":20040088623,""issue"":""6"",""issn"":""0033-3174"",""id"":""aa61779ff8554200bde54d60b2937c9c"",""publicationName"":""Psychosomatic medicine"",""publicationDate"":""2001-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088623

Scott"",""Danielle Lopez"",""Amanda Saravia-Butler"",""Lauren Sanders"",""Sam Gebre"",""Sylvain Costes""]","Increased biomedical risks and challenges associated with deep space missions require new knowledge discovery, new health countermeasures, and development of novel ecosystems, life support, crop production, and biomedical support capabilities. To meet NASA’s Moon to Mars strategic program goals for Human and Biological Sciences, findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR), and maximally open-access data is going to be required to enable humanity to thrive in deep space. Indeed, this cornerstone perspective on FAIR and maximally open access data was also recommended in the recent 2023-2032 Decadal Survey from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 

The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) is a maximally open access and FAIR database, and meets various scientific, technical, and operational spaceflight needs. It offers public users and submitters the ability to upload, download, search, share, analyze, and visualize data across ‘omics, physiological, phenotypic, behavioral, bioimaging, video, and environmental monitoring telemetry datasets. OSDR includes NASA GeneLab, NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive, and the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection. OSDR has >455 studies with datasets from model organisms and non-NASA human astronauts. There are ~12 datasets from the Inspiration 4 (I4) mission, spanning metagenomics, comprehensive metabolic panels, clonal hematopoiesis, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and cytokine panels. In the interest of data privacy, two I4 datasets have raw FASTQ and FASTA files relating to the epitranscriptome, and a new request feature is live in OSDR (with a backend review process established) which was developed based on industry norms. OSDR also recently began a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) to scientifically curate and make available >200 terabytes of human and model organism space-relevant data. The OSDR submission portal is designed to ingest and curate ~25 ‘omics assay data types, and ~50 physiological-phenotypic-imaging assay data types, spanning ultrasonography, micro-computed tomography, histology, morphometric photography, rebound tonometry, gait analysis, optical coherence tomography, novel object recognition, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. 

A suite of analysis tools are available for OSDR users including: 1) an Environmental Data Application to compare radiation, CO2, relative humidity, temperature, and other telemetry across missions and subjects, 2) the RadLab database, a collaboration between NASA, ESA, the German and Italian Space Agencies, and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, which compiles radiation measurements relevant to human spaceflight and provides tools for accessing and manipulating the data, and 3) a Multi-study visualization tool which enables users to look across and combine GeneLab’s omics datasets across different experiments and missions.

There are ~600 volunteer OSDR Analysis Working Group (AWG) members who: 1) provide feedback on scientific standards for reuse (subject and assay metadata; processing pipelines; dataset formats and uniformed structures for machine-readability), and 2) collaborate to mine-reuse OSDR data conducting scientific analysis. OSDR has enabled 60 publications as of September 2023, many directly from AWG collaborations most notably the Cell Press package in 2020. Lastly, there are at least 15 articles which mine OSDR data part of a package of ~50 articles across Nature Portfolio with research stemming from I4, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, NASA Space Biology, and the NASA Human Research Program.

In order to achieve such an ambitious goal, a space habitat will need to accommodate a crew of four for the 380-day round trip. The Human Spaceflight Architecture Team (HAT) developed a conceptual design for such a habitat. The team identified activities that would be performed inside a long-duration, deep space habitat, and the capabilities needed to support such a mission. A list of seven functional activities/capabilities was developed: individual and group crew care, spacecraft and mission operations, subsystem equipment, logistics and resupply, and contingency operations. The volume for each activity was determined using NASA STD-3001 and the companion Human Integration Design Handbook (HIDH). Although, the sum of these volumes produced an over-sized spacecraft, the team evaluated activity frequency and duration to identify functions that could share a common volume without conflict, reducing the total volume by 24%. After adding 10% for growth, the resulting functional pressurized volume was calculated to be a minimum of 268 cu m (9,464 cu ft) distributed over the functions. The work was validated through comparison to Mir, Skylab, the International Space Station (ISS), Bigelow Aerospace s proposed habitat module, and NASA s Trans-Hab concept. Using HIDH guidelines, the team developed an internal layout that (a) minimized the transit time between related crew stations, (b) accommodated expected levels of activity at each station, (c) isolated stations when necessary for health, safety, performance, and privacy, and (d) provided a safe, efficient, and comfortable work and living environment.","[{""submissionId"":20120008183,""id"":""e550ae9c38a64be5b8788ff113e49979"",""publicationDate"":""2012-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20120008183,""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""Reston, VA, United States"",""id"":""e578b1489ed64f9faa8596d5bdb52815""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20120008183,""endDate"":""2012-05-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""Reston, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""eb2f061cd865467eb12be3f95548b1e0"",""id"":""1ee52899c65743bb8c590b6ba5da46e4""}],""name"":""Global Exploration 2012 Conference"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""eb2f061cd865467eb12be3f95548b1e0"",""startDate"":""2012-05-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]","[{""id"":20140012748,""title"":""Developing a Habitat for Long Duration, Deep Space Missions""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120008183

20250000009,PRESENTATION,Earth-Independent Medical Operations (EIMO) Concept of Operations,"[""Marina Parker"",""Mike Krihak"",""Chris Laing"",""Jorge Bardina"",""Prashant Parmar"",""Arian Anderson""]","In contrast to the current crew health paradigm for low-Earth orbit and Lunar missions, which depends on real-time communication with Mission Control, deep-space exploration missions will require a significant shift in medical operations. This shift is driven by the constraints of operating at a considerable distance from Earth, such as resource limitations—lack of resupply, restricted mass, power, volume, and data—as well as communication delays and the inability to evacuate back to Earth during emergencies. To move toward a more self-reliant medical model, a strategy is needed to gradually increase space-based crew autonomy and reduce risks to mission success in the challenging environment of deep space. This transformative change, known as ""Earth-Independent Medical Operations"" (EIMO), explores the gradual transfer of medical care and decision-making from Earth-based support to space-based systems. The goal of this transition is to enhance astronaut health and performance while minimizing mission risks. EIMO requires the development of a medical system that integrates seamlessly with mission planning, vehicle and spacesuit design, and data architecture. This integration is crucial for building a robust medical infrastructure that not only safeguards astronaut well-being but also ensures overall mission success. 

The Human Research Program (HRP) Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element has revised the EIMO model-based Concept of Operations (ConOps) which outlines an initial vision for EIMO. The ConOps, which is built on the stakeholders’ need, system goals, and objectives (NGOs), presents an array of in-mission scenarios that span a wide range of medical conditions demonstrating the system’s capabilities from basic to complex events. Developed by a multidisciplinary team of systems engineers, scientists, and clinicians within ExMC, the ConOps revision includes two new scenarios(Barotrauma and Self-Medical Management and Behavioral Health and Chronic Medical Care), and implementation of findings from EIMO technical interchange meetings that focused on data and training. The envisioned EIMO Medical System (MS) operates as a system of systems, gathering data from various sources such as reference databases, real-time wearable sensors, point-of-care diagnostics, and environmental controls. The MS also incorporates advanced training tools to support autonomous medical care, assisting the Crew Medical Officer (CMO) during medical events where Ground Support is either unavailable or communication-delayed beyond practicality. Furthermore, MS functions and capabilities were decomposed from the scenarios to establish foundational requirements for EIMO and traced to the NASA Spaceflight Human-System Standard(NASA-STD-3001, Volumes 1 and 2).  These traces were performed to gain insights on the alignment of EIMO requirements with the NASA standard. This work serves as an initial recommendation to increase crew autonomy gradually and safely for Mars missions and future deep-space exploration.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20250000009,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d17b6f2867934f50bf674af7873ab2e6"",""id"":""3ba16c39f7df4a0d828ed806652a31e3""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""d17b6f2867934f50bf674af7873ab2e6"",""url"":""https://www.nasa.gov/hrp-iws-2025/"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.04.01.19.2416"",""80LARC23DA003"",""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250000009
20140003386,ABSTRACT,Assessing the Risk of Disc Heniation Related to Landing Impact Following Long-duration Spacecraft,"[""Somers, J. T."",""Newby, N.."",""Wells, J.""]","Previous research has shown that crewmembers returning on the Space Shuttle have an increased incidence of herniated nucleus pulposus after spaceflight. This increased risk is thought to be related to disc volume expansion due to unloading and prolonged exposure to microgravity. Although there is an increased risk of disc herniation in Space Shuttle astronauts, it is unknown if dynamic landing loads further contribute to the risk of herniation. To determine if dynamic loads increase the risk of incidence, data from crewmembers (excluding cosmonauts) returning on the Soyuz spacecraft will be compared to Space Shuttle astronauts. These data will be obtained from the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health (LSAH) Project at NASA. Severity and incidence after spaceflight will be mined from the data, and statistical analyses will be used to determine if Soyuz crewmembers have a higher incidence of disc herniation than Space Shuttle crewmembers. The results are expected to show no difference between Space Shuttle and Soyuz crewmembers, indicating that higher dynamic loads on landing and long-duration spaceflight do not significantly increase the risk of disc herniation. If no difference is shown between the two crewmember populations, then disc volume expansion due to microgravity does not significantly increase the risk of injury due to dynamic loads for deconditioned crewmembers. Any risk associated with deconditioning would be primarily due to bone structure changes and resulting bone strength changes. This study is an important first step in determining whether the spinal disc plays a role in injury due to dynamic loads.","[{""submissionId"":20140003386,""id"":""922f6d70627344ee8daf3c0ca437c558"",""publicationDate"":""2014-02-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140003386,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""a14f83f239c0434baf69cc49c4bb35bf""},{""submissionId"":20140003386,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""f87d529e75d547cbbf219b42ae80064b""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140003386,""endDate"":""2014-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""8ccaff322ecb48d2811364bf91d9f59d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""58402a5741804d74b5faa2aed4b818a7"",""id"":""f402b2222c0b4268853612a6436d3e26""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""58402a5741804d74b5faa2aed4b818a7"",""id"":""40ad727140784fc69ea0037ab486a217""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""58402a5741804d74b5faa2aed4b818a7"",""id"":""a87b75c01bf94d71ad6f10f1c8d54089""}],""name"":""2014 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP 2014)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""58402a5741804d74b5faa2aed4b818a7"",""startDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140003386
20205004814,PRESENTATION,Developing High-Throughput Organ-on-a-Chip Models to Investigate the Effects of Ionizing Radiation on the Central Nervous System,"[""Sherina Malkani"",""Eloise Pariset"",""Sylvain V Costes"",""Egle Cekanaviciute""]","One of the main health risks in human space exploration is central nervous system (CNS) damage by ionizing radiation due to exposure to the galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). In animal models, irradiation with simulated GCRs or their components has been shown to cause neuronal damage and neuroinflammation associated with cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. In general, the extent of CNS damage is partially regulated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which enables immune cells to enter the CNS. The main cellular regulators of BBB permeability are astrocytes, which also modulate neuronal death, immune responses and oxidative stress, and thus could serve as a robust CNS-specific target for countermeasure development. However, studies on BBB permeability and astrocyte functions in regulating CNS responses to ionizing radiation have been limited, especially in human tissue/organ analogs. Therefore, we established a high-throughput 3D organ-on-a-chip system to study human CNS and BBB impairments in response to ionizing radiation, based on commercially available OrganoPlates (Mimetas, Inc.) seeded with primary or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human cells. We investigated both immediate and delayed CNS responses to major GCR components: 0.15-0.5 Gy 250MeV/n 4-He, and 0.3-0.8 Gy 600 MeV/n 56-Fe; as well as to 0.5-1 Gy X-rays. We observed ionizing radiation-mediated increases in BBB permeability that was exacerbated by astrocyte presence and accompanied by morphological changes in endothelial cells and tight junctions, altered cytokine profile including TNFa upregulation, and increased oxidative stress. We also quantified irradiation-mediated changes in astrocyte activation and neuronal functions, revealing major astrocyte damage mediated by 600MeV/n 56-Fe particles. Thus, we demonstrate that deep space radiation may contribute to CNS damage by disrupting both astrocyte and endothelial cell components of the blood-brain barrier. Our next steps include mapping and validating the transcriptomic changes induced by simulated GCRs and their components in human CNS models. Ultimately, we aim to uncover potential novel targets for countermeasure developments to mitigate CNS damage in long duration spaceflight.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20205004814,""endDate"":""2020-10-21T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""426499858bfb5eeebee9bd0b63129b00"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Bozeman, Montana, United States""}},""meetingId"":""8906c92f363e47a7a20294dd9ba7fa7e"",""id"":""f90e14e1e6be45588281755871553b57""}],""name"":""Radiation Research Society Annual Meeting"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""8906c92f363e47a7a20294dd9ba7fa7e"",""startDate"":""2020-10-18T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""80JSC018N0001"",""NNA16BD14C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205004814
20210021216,PRESENTATION,Bio-stasis: A Strategy for Survivability and Payload Cost Reduction in Long-duration Space Missions,"[""Yuri Griko""]","As humans proceed with long-term space voyages, involving flights with lasting duration of months or years, “adaptation to space” will eventually lead to hard realities resultant physiological and psychological conditions must be realistically estimated and considered before it occurs. It is obvious that humans in their lifespan cannot adopt to spaceflight environment by reversible modification of their complex biochemical reactions and physiological functions without jeopardizing sustainable homeostasis shaped by multiple generations during evolution. In this case Nature offers an evolutionary proven alternative strategy- a coordinative adjustment of metabolism in order to survive. Incorporation of this metabolic adjustment strategy along with the relevant life support system into space flight architecture would protect humans during long term space flight from many irreversible physiological alterations and may dramatically reduce overall cost of space missions. In addition to the harmful space radiation and prolonged weightlessness, incorporation of this strategy may also benefit by solving other major medical unknowns in interplanetary flight such as isolation and psychological stress which still remains a risk. It is one of the priorities of NASA and other space agencies to figure out not only how to keep long-distance travelers alive and in good cognitive health but also how to return them to normal life on Earth with a minimum rehabilitation period after prolonged exposure to space.  Presently re-adaptation of astronauts to Earth conditions and recovery from spaceflight exposure may take many months and years and, in some cases, require medical intervention. Therefore, recognizing physiological adjustment of the energy-regulating system as a viable life support strategy for human space exploration beyond LEO is essential.

20250002737,TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM,Concern of Intervertebral Disc Damage Upon and Immediately After Re-Exposure to Gravity (Inactive),"[""Jean D Sibonga""]","There is an increased incidence of back pain expressed by crewmembers in space. Additionally, herniated Intervertebral Discs (IVD) have been diagnosed in returning Skylab and Shuttle astronauts on landing day, and after varying periods of time in the postflight period. Such injuries in astronauts, however, may be related to their careers as aviators (either high performance jet pilots and/or helicopter pilots). However, the evidence of IVD injuries raises the concern that astronauts are at increased risk during loading scenarios experienced during or after exploration missions (for example, re-entry to a gravitational field, activities on planetary surfaces).

To date, flight data related to potential back injuries have focused upon spine elongation and the well-established effects of mechanical unloading on intervertebral discs (IVDs). IVDs are the articulating connective tissue between vertebral bodies of the spinal column where the IVD acts as a shock absorber to the mechanical loads experienced in the axial direction. The connective tissue of joints is devoid of vasculature so exchanges between nutrients and waste products are accomplished by the influx and efflux of fluid. In general, the diurnal fluctuations in IVD volume of the spine are induced as the individual transitions between sleep (supine) and ambulation (upright), although the spine is subjected to a variety of mechanical forces with daily activities in 1 G. However, during prolonged bed rest or spaceflight, the absence of axial and muscular loading to the spine causes the IVDs to swell with increased fluid intake. Consequently, the changes in IVD volume were considered major factors for the elongation of the spine, the increase in height and the loss of lordotic curvature. IVD changes may also account for the occurrence of back pain, although the exact cause for the latter is not well defined. Tissue analyses of animals, mechanically unloaded in space and ground-based models, reveal changes in IVD biochemical composition. Spaceflight-induced changes to IVDs may predispose the IVD to injury during reloading. No flight studies have investigated whether a specific exercise regimen, performed during real or simulated weightlessness, can effectively impart axial loads to the human spine to mimic the diurnal changes in IVD volume experienced on Earth. Restoration of IVD volume, after spaceflight and bed rest, has been observed with return to upright position in a 1-G environment, but the recovery time course has not been systematically assessed. Likewise, IVD biochemical and biomechanical properties, before and after spaceflight, have not been investigated.

In brief, extended exposures to microgravity are associated with increased reports of back pain during flight and may be related to the occurrence of IVD herniations in astronauts after flight. The etiology for these observations may be multi-factorial given the number of documented physiological risk factors induced in space, which include muscle atrophy, tissue degeneration, bone fracture and accelerated bone loss. Thus, further investigations are needed to generate more evidence to better define the risk.","[{""submissionId"":20250002737,""publisher"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""id"":""0a43c6646e9a4d8faf0e804b96972042"",""publicationDate"":""2025-03-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""012556.02.04.24.04""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250002737

Riascos"",""Kofman, I."",""Bloomberg, J."",""Mulavara, A"",""Seidler, R.""]","Long duration spaceflight has been associated with detrimental alterations in human sensorimotor functioning. Prolonged exposure to a head-down tilt (HDT) position during long duration bed rest can resemble several effects of the microgravity environment such as reduced sensory inputs, body unloading and increased cephalic fluid distribution. The question of whether microgravity affects other central nervous system functions such as brain functional connectivity and its relationship with behavior is largely unknown, but of importance to the health and performance of astronauts both during and post-flight. In the present study, we investigate the effects of prolonged exposure to HDT bed rest on resting state brain functional connectivity and its association with behavioral changes in 17 male participants. To validate that our findings were not due to confounding factors such as time or task practice, we also acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and behavioral measurements from 14 normative control participants at four time points. Bed rest participants remained in bed with their heads tilted down six degrees below their feet for 70 consecutive days. Rs-fMRI and behavioral data were obtained at seven time points averaging around: 12 and 8 days prior to bed rest; 7, 50, and 70 days during bed rest; and 8 and 12 days after bed rest. 70 days of HDT bed rest resulted in significant increases in functional connectivity during bed rest followed by a reversal of changes in the post bed rest recovery period between motor cortical and somatosensory areas of the brain. In contrast, decreases in connectivity were observed between temporoparietal regions. Furthermore, post-hoc correlation analyses revealed a significant relationship between motor-somatosensory network connectivity and standing balance performance changes; participants that exhibited the greatest increases in connectivity strength showed the least deterioration in postural equilibrium with HDT bed rest. This suggests that neuroplastic processes may facilitate adaptation to the HDT bed rest environment. The findings from this study provide novel insights into the neurobiology and future risk assessments of long-duration spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":20150023269,""id"":""f00fc5b63f57483d959040137583f0fa"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150023269,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""63098dc37588451e95aa6032ad1c4b14"",""id"":""7a4c45d1d2d341f9a95239500eeff916""}],""name"":""2016 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2016)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""63098dc37588451e95aa6032ad1c4b14"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNX11AR02G"",""NCC9-58"",""1UL1RR029876-01""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150023269
20150003015,ABSTRACT,Assessing and Promoting Functional Resilience in Flight Crews During Exploration Missions,"[""Shelhamer, Mark""]","NASA plans to send humans to Mars in about 20 years. The NASA Human Research Program supports research to mitigate the major risks to human health and performance on extended missions. However, there will undoubtedly be unforeseen events on any mission of this nature - thus mitigation of known risks alone is not sufficient to ensure optimal crew health and performance. Research should be directed not only to mitigating known risks, but also to providing crews with the tools to assess and enhance resilience, as a group and individually. We can draw on ideas from complexity theory and network theory to assess crew and individual resilience. The entire crew or the individual crewmember can be viewed as a complex system that is composed of subsystems (individual crewmembers or physiological subsystems), and the interactions between subsystems are of crucial importance for overall health and performance. An understanding of the structure of the interactions can provide important information even in the absence of complete information on the component subsystems. This is critical in human spaceflight, since insufficient flight opportunities exist to elucidate the details of each subsystem. Enabled by recent advances in noninvasive measurement of physiological and behavioral parameters, subsystem monitoring can be implemented within a mission and also during preflight training to establish baseline values and ranges. Coupled with appropriate mathematical modeling, this can provide real-time assessment of health and function, and detect early indications of imminent breakdown. Since the interconnected web of physiological systems (and crewmembers) can be interpreted as a network in mathematical terms, we can draw on recent work that relates the structure of such networks to their resilience (ability to self-organize in the face of perturbation). There are many parameters and interactions to choose from. Normal variability is an established characteristic of a healthy physiological response. Healthy coupling has been investigated less extensively, but there are cases in which too tight or too loose coupling can be problematic. This might be in inter-individual behaviors, such as sleep cycles, coordination of work and meal times, and coupled motions during communication. Less apparent are couplings of physiological systems, nevertheless examples abound of coupled systems which might be monitored: cardio-respiratory rhythms; circadian rhythms, body temperature, and sleep; stress markers and cognition, sleep, and performance; profiles of biochemical markers related to immune function and nutritional status; sensorimotor aspects such as motion sickness, ataxia, reaction time, and manual control. Tools for resilience are then the means to measure and analyze these parameters, incorporate them into appropriate models of normal variability and interconnectedness, and recognize when parameters or their couplings are outside of normal limits. What to do when a problem is identified depends on its nature. Changes can be made to crew procedures, work pacing, interpersonal interactions, sleep cycles, meal timing and content, as guided by the model. Use and continued development of these methods could not only provide tools for resilience, but also meaningful autonomous work for the crew on an extended flight.","[{""submissionId"":20150003015,""id"":""6bddc73f2f4a4bc3bc8a375cb492d6e6"",""publicationDate"":""2015-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150003015,""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Paris, France"",""id"":""f7204b41f63244ad9e33e53a0f4792f4""},{""country"":""Czechoslovakia"",""submissionId"":20150003015,""endDate"":""2015-07-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""61252b49d4a446c084d4cc392f856968"",""id"":""32193ce9e1fb439a9d92592e0bb14f5d""}],""name"":""Humans in Space Symposium"",""location"":""Prague"",""id"":""61252b49d4a446c084d4cc392f856968"",""startDate"":""2015-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]","[{""id"":20150013811,""title"":""Assessing and Promoting Functional Resilience in Flight Crews During Exploration Missions""},{""id"":20150013811,""title"":""Assessing and Promoting Functional Resilience in Flight Crews During Exploration Missions""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150003015

The Aquarius habitat is anchored 62 feet deep on Conch Reef which is a research only zone for coral reef monitoring in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The crew lives in saturation for a week to ten days and conducts a variety of undersea EVAs (Extra Vehicular Activities) to test a suite of long-duration spaceflight Engineering, Biomedical, and Geoscience objectives. The crew also tests concepts for future lunar exploration using advanced navigation and communication equipment in support of the Constellation Program planetary exploration analog studies. The Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) Directorate and Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) at NASA/Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas support this effort to produce a high-fidelity test-bed for studies of human planetary exploration in extreme environments as well as to develop and test the synergy between human and robotic curation protocols including sample collection, documentation, and sample handling. The geoscience objectives for NEEMO missions reflect the requirements for Lunar Surface Science outlined by the LEAG (Lunar Exploration Analysis Group) and CAPTEM (Curation and Analysis Planning Team for Extraterrestrial Materials) white paper [1].

The primary objectives of this analog study were to detail the capabilities, decision-making process, and operational concepts required to meet non-simulated scientific objectives during 5-minute one-way communication latency utilizing crew and robotic assets. Furthermore, this field study served as an opportunity build upon previous tests at PLRP, NASA Desert Research and Technology Studies (DRATS), and NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) to characterize the functional roles and responsibilities of the personnel involved in the distributed flight control team and identify operational constraints imposed by science-driven EVA operations.

20220014770,PRESENTATION,Intracranial Effects of Intermittent Lower Body Negative Pressure with Head Down Tilt Bed Rest: Comparison to Upright Posture,"[""Larry A Kramer "",""Khader H Hasan "",""K Marshall-Goebel"",""Bryn Martin""]","INTRODUCTION
Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) affects a majority of astronauts during long-duration spaceflight. SANS is hypothesized to result from an unrelenting headward fluid shift that occurs in the microgravity environment.  Altered intracranial structure and physiology documented in spaceflight and head-down tilt (HDT) experiments(1, 2) are also theorized to be related to chronic headward fluid shift and thereby can provide an independent quantitative assessment related to this mechanism.  As a potential countermeasure, lower body negative pressure (LBNP) applied in the supine posture has shown efficacy in reducing headward fluid shift(3). However, it remains unknown if intermittent LBNP simulating daily upright posture fluid redistribution can mitigate SANS and intracranial changes associated with long-duration spaceflight. The goal of this study was to quantify the effects of daily application of LBNP or daily exposure to the upright posture on intracranial structure and physiology during long-term HDT in order to evaluate the potential efficacy of LBNP as a countermeasure to SANS.

METHODS
22 healthy volunteers (11 men; 11 women; mean age = 35 years (SD=9.2)(age range = 24 to 52 years); mean BMI = 24.0 kg/m2 (SD=2.8)) completed an MRI study performed at the German Aerospace Facility in Cologne, Germany.  Strict six-degree head-down tilt (HDT) bedrest was used as a spaceflight analog to induce a continuous headward fluid shift for 30 days. The subjects were divided equally into two groups of interventions: 1) LBNP for 3-hour sessions twice daily and 2) seated position for 3-hour sessions twice daily. Interventions were divided into morning and afternoon sessions for both groups. The LBNP intervention was maintained at 25 mmHg  2 mmHg. Pulse-gated MRI phase-contrast flow imaging was used to quantify cerebral artery stroke volume (CASV) and peak-to-peak cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) velocity (CSFVp-p) within the cerebral aqueduct.  A 3D T1-MPRAGE sequence was used to quantify volumetric changes of the brain and intracranial CSF spaces using MRI Cloud software. MRI acquisitions were obtained at baseline (BDC, supine posture), 15 days into HDT (HDT15), 29 days into HDT (HDT29), and 12 days after recovery (R12, supine posture). The data were analyzed by a mixed model, which included intervention, time (four nominal levels BDC, HDT15, HDT29, R12), and intervention-time interaction as the fixed effects and included subject as a random effect.

RESULTS
Compared to BDC there was no statistically significant difference in CASV and CSFVp-p during HDT except for CASV at HDT29 (seated group) where there was a 1.7 mL (12%) decrease (P<0.01). Compared to BDC there was a statistically significant increase in intracranial volume (ICV; ICV = white matter + gray matter + CSF) for both interventions at HDT15 (Δ13 mL, 0.9 % (LBNP group); Δ15 mL, 1.0%, (seated group)) and HDT29 (Δ19 mL, 1.2%, (LBNP group); Δ23 mL, 1.5%) (seated group)) (All Ps<.001). Compared to baseline, lateral ventricular volume increased at HDT15 (Δ0.9 mL, 5.5%) and HDT29 (Δ1.8 mL, 10%)) for LBNP only (P=.001 for each). During HDT, white matter volume remained stable compared to baseline for both interventions. There were no significant intervention effects in the overall response to HDT (All Ps >.2).

CONCLUSION
LBNP had a similar response to the seated posture during 29 days of HDT. Although there was an increase in ICV and lateral ventricular volume with HDT there was no change in intracranial physiological parameters with LBNP suggesting an overall diminished response to the long-term effects of HDT. The lack of any significant increase in white matter volume during HDT with LBNP suggests maintenance of cerebral interstitial fluid transport.  Final conclusions are pending the data collection for the control group (no intervention) which will be completed in 2023.

Pletcher""]","As NASA plans for exploration missions into deep space, significant challenges are realized due to the distance from Earth.  Beside the effects of microgravity and radiation exposure, the astronauts face the additional constraints of isolation, lack of resupply, increasingly difficult evacuation, and delayed and disrupted communication with ground-based medical care providers.  These constraints require a paradigm shift from current medical care where crews rely on the real-time communications with ground-based medical care providers toward Earth-independent medical operations for astronaut medical care. Medical expertise and decision-making are ground-based for current International Space Station and planned Lunar missions.   However, a deep space exploration crew will need to autonomously perform the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of medical conditions.  One approach to provide Earth-independent medical operations is to augment the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) of a time-constrained crew—operating under stressful conditions, combatting fatigue, and facing a potential medical crisis—with a robust clinical decision support system (CDSS).

The CDSS is envisioned as an integrated, software-based tool deployed on a laptop computer or handheld device. The CDSS will assist the crew and ground support when interacting with knowledge/data bases (e.g. records, pharmacy, schedule), instrumentation (e.g. imaging, physiological monitoring devices), and habitat (e.g. wellness system, task performance system) and vehicle systems (e.g. environmental system, communication system).  In addition, the human interface will employ a context-based approach that accounts for the crew’s situation.  Thus, extraneous and clinically/operationally non-relevant information are reduced to avoid an increase in cognitive load.  The framework of an ideal spaceflight CDSS is to include core and advanced analytical features that maintain a flexible platform for integrating new technology in the future.  

The Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element of the Human Research Program (HRP) is expanding the boundaries of space medical systems to advance the care of astronauts on future exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit by actively identifying and testing next-generation medical care and crew health maintenance technologies.  The Clinical Decision Support (CDS) project addressed ap Medical-701 within the Inflight Medical Conditions risk:  “We need to increase inflight medical capabilities and identify new capabilities that (a) maximize benefit and/or (b) reduce “costs” on human system/mission/vehicle resources.”  Though mass, volume, and power will face increasing constraints, the projected computational capabilities of spacecraft systems will increase exponentially as information technology advances in this decade and beyond.  Hence, data, software, and computational resources will play an essential and synergistic role in maintaining crew health, wellness, and performance in deep space missions.

The focus of the CDS project was to develop recommended requirements for an in-vehicle CDSS that acts as a ‘virtual assistant’ for delivering optimal health, performance, and medical care during exploration missions.  In fiscal year 2022 (FY22), the CDS project was chartered to baseline and/or revise all CDS project related documentation and update the CDS project model to include the revised CDSS Concept of Operations, revised systems-based modeling language (SysML) activity diagrams, and baseline requirements.

20150021960,ABSTRACT,Management of Asymptomatic Renal Stones in Astronauts,"[""Reyes, David"",""Locke, James""]","Introduction: Management guidelines were created to screen and manage asymptomatic renal stones in U.S. astronauts. The risks for renal stone formation in astronauts due to bone loss and hypercalcuria are unknown. Astronauts have a stone risk which is about the same as commercial aviation pilots, which is about half that of the general population. However, proper management of this condition is still crucial to mitigate health and mission risks in the spaceflight environment. Methods: An extensive review of the literature and current aeromedical standards for the monitoring and management of renal stones was done. The NASA Flight Medicine Clinic's electronic medical record and Longitudinal Survey of Astronaut Health were also reviewed. Using this work, a screening and management algorithm was created that takes into consideration the unique operational environment of spaceflight. Results: Renal stone screening and management guidelines for astronauts were created based on accepted standards of care, with consideration to the environment of spaceflight. In the proposed algorithm, all astronauts will receive a yearly screening ultrasound for renal calcifications, or mineralized renal material (MRM). Any areas of MRM, 3 millimeters or larger, are considered a positive finding. Three millimeters approaches the detection limit of standard ultrasound, and several studies have shown that any stone that is 3 millimeters or less has an approximately 95 percent chance of spontaneous passage. For mission-assigned astronauts, any positive ultrasound study is followed by low-dose renal computed tomography (CT) scan, and flexible ureteroscopy if CT is positive. Other specific guidelines were also created. Discussion: The term ""MRM"" is used to account for small areas of calcification that may be outside the renal collecting system, and allows objectivity without otherwise constraining the diagnostic and treatment process for potentially very small calcifications of uncertain significance. However, a small asymptomatic MRM or stone within the renal collecting system may become symptomatic, and so affect launch and flight schedules, cause incapacitation during flight, and ultimately require medical evacuation. For exploration class missions, evacuation is unlikely. The new screening and management algorithm allows better management of mission risks, and will define the true incidence of renal stones in U.S. astronauts. This information will be used to refine future screening, countermeasures and treatment methods; and will also inform the needed capabilities to be flown on exploration-class missions.","[{""submissionId"":20150021960,""id"":""3c5d5011b6a84f37ac6783f662b30d37"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150021960,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""f98fca078bd64371a5eb8c2e43b409c7""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150021960,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""1c50996ecec346bbb3e04e515c38efda"",""id"":""38b2787fa9bd46b084c36e2ba83f6a24""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2016)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""1c50996ecec346bbb3e04e515c38efda"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20160001728,""title"":""Management of Asymptomatic Renal Stones in Astronauts""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150021960

20230015498,ABSTRACT,Crew State and Risk Model Development to Predict Hydration Status During Extravehicular Activity Training Events,"[""L Cooper"",""B Hoffmann"",""S York"",""L Dillon"",""K Marshall-Goebel"",""J Somers"",""D Buckland""]","Introduction: 

Hydration is critical for optimal human health and performance and dehydration can lead to impaired cardiovascular function, thermal dysregulation, decreased blood plasma volume, and cognitive impacts, particularly during physical activity. Prolonged and repeated extravehicular activities (EVA) without sufficiently available drinking water may increase risk for dehydration, which could impair crew health and impact mission success. Understanding hydration needs and potential effects on health and performance are necessary to optimize crew well-being and enable successful EVA objectives. This study aims to develop a model of hydration status during EVA using water balance techniques.

Methods:

Water balance measures were collected on 15 healthy astronauts who performed ≈6-hour simulated microgravity extravehicular activity (EVA) training in the NASA Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL). Data collected included pre-and post-EVA nude body weight (BW), maximum absorption garment (MAG) weight, Disposable In-suit Drink Bag (DIDB) weight, urine specific gravity (USG), and extra pre-EVA intake (W). Variables were combined to create the water balance model as pre-EVA (Hn)= BWn+ MAGn+ DIDBn+ Wnand post EVA (Hn+1) = BWn+1+ MAGn+1+ DIDBn+1. Urine specific gravity values were used to refine water balance measures into hydration categories: Hydrated, Marginally Hydrated, and Dehydrated.

 Results:

Pre-EVA  modeling indicated53% of crew were hydrated, 20% were marginally hydrated, and 27% were dehydrated. Alternately, Hn+1 showed 13% of crew remained hydrated, 47% were marginally hydrated, and 40% were dehydrated at the end of the EVA. Furthermore, 75% of the crewmembers who started sufficiently hydrated finished the run marginally hydrated or dehydrated. According to USG indices presented by Casa and Lawrence, et al. (2000), only 25% of the crew started and remained hydrated throughout the EVA, and those who were dehydrated at the outset stayed dehydrated.

 Conclusion: 

Model outcomes assessing hydration status during 6-hour simulated microgravity EVAs demonstrate the necessity to further address hydration requirements for optimal human performance during spaceflight and EVA. This study enables additional baseline development of the Crew State and Risk Model Hydration, Nutrition, and Waste Management component that aims to provide individualized crew state and risk predictions during EVAs.

M."",""Huff, J. L."",""Semones, E. J."",""Simonsen, L. C."",""Patel, Z. S.""]","Since the beginning of manned spaceflight, NASA has recognized the potential risk of cardiovascular decrements due to stressors in the space environment. Of particular concern is the effect of space radiation on cardiovascular disease since astronauts will be exposed to higher levels of galactic cosmic rays outside the Earth's protective magnetosphere. To date, only a few studies have examined the effects of heavy ion radiation on cardiovascular disease, and at lower, space-relevant doses, the association between radiation exposure and cardiovascular pathology is more varied and unclear. Furthermore, other spaceflight conditions such as microgravity, circadian shifts, and confinement stress pose unique challenges in estimating the health risks that can be attributed to exposure to ionizing radiations. In this work, we review age, cause of mortality, and radiation exposure amongst early NASA astronauts in selection groups and discuss the limitations of assessing such a cohort when attempting to characterize the risk of space flight, including stressors such as space radiation and microgravity exposure, on cardiovascular health. METHODS: NASA astronauts in selection groups 1-7 were chosen and the comparison population was white men of the same birth cohort as drawn from data from the CDC Wonder Database and CDC National Center for Health Statistics Life Tables. Cause of death information was obtained from the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health program and deceased astronauts were classified based on ICD-10 codes: ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, cancer, acute occupational events, non-NASA accidents, and other/unknown. Expected years of life left and expected age at death were calculated for the cohort. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There were 32 deaths in this early astronaut population, 12 of which were due to accidents or acute occupational events that impacted lifespan considerably. The average age at death from these causes is 30 years lower than the average expected ~70 years of age in the general population. Remarkably, all 41 living early astronauts outlived our calculated expected age at death for members of their birth cohort; furthermore, 13 of the 20 deceased astronauts who did not die in NASA/non-NASA accidents exceeded this age. There was no difference in IHD between the astronaut cohort and the comparison population; therefore, it is not possible to associate IHD mortality with radiation in that astronaut cohort. As NASA looks toward future exploration-class missions, early astronaut cohorts provide a convenient option for assessing these risks and for developing mitigation strategies. However, many challenges still exist when assessing such limited evidence, including small cohort size, health and lifestyle confounders (such as smoking and drinking), the high accident mortality rate, and the fact that many of these astronauts are still alive, outliving many of their birth-cohort peers. Future analysis should include a longitudinal study, monitoring cases as they occur in the cohort. As this cohort is currently followed-up over time, and as more IHD cases are anticipated in a population of this age, this type of study is not as resource-intensive as would normally be the case.","[{""submissionId"":20160014520,""id"":""b66b6242b55648ef86b0e15833680096"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160014520,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst.

Elevated bone resorption is a hallmark of human spaceflight and bed rest (common zero-G analog). We tested whether an antiresorptive drug in combination with in-flight exercise would ameliorate bone loss and hypercalcuria during longduration spaceflight. Measurements include DXA, QCT, pQCT, and urine and blood biomarkers. We have completed analysis of 7 crewmembers treated with alendronate during flight and the immediate postflight (R+<2 week) data collection in 5 of 10 controls without treatment. Both groups used the advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) during their missions. We previously reported the pre/postflight results of crew taking alendronate during flight (Osteoporosis Int. 24:2105-2114, 2013). The purpose of this report is to present the 12-month follow-up data in the treated astronauts and to compare these results with preliminary data from untreated crewmembers exercising with ARED (ARED control) or without ARED (Pre-ARED control). Results: the table presents DXA and QCT BMD expressed as percentage change from preflight in the control astronauts (18 Pre-ARED and the current 5 ARED-1-year data not yet available) and the 7 treated subjects. As shown previously the combination of exercise plus antiresorptive is effective in preventing bone loss during flight. Bone measures for treated subjects, 1 year after return from space remain at or near baseline values. Except in one region, the treated group maintained or gained bone 1 year after flight. Biomarker data are not currently available for either control group and therefore not presented. However, data from other studies with or without ARED show elevated bone resorption and urinary Ca excretion while bisphosphonate treated subjects show decreases during flight. Comparing the two control groups suggests significant but incomplete improvement in maintaining BMD using the newer exercise protocols compared to earlier resistive exercise protocols. Quantitative characterization of this improvement requires additional measurements in the ARED control group that we are currently collecting. In conclusion, these results indicate that an antiresorptive may be an effective adjunct to exercise during long-duration spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":20140003448,""id"":""77e1dcdf8dea4b2e92ec331cd12a2597"",""publicationDate"":""2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140003448,""name"":""American Society for Bone and Mineral Research"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""0a062364b06142c8974337e20018eaa8""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140003448

Gensler"",""Hang N. Nguyen"",""G. Marie Sharp"",""Mark R. Fernandez"",""Naeem Altaf "",""Minsik Lee"",""Miten Jain""]","Characterization of the International Space Station (ISS) microbiome has been enabled by sample return and Earth-based analysis. As human exploration pushes beyond low-Earth orbit, microbial-related crew health, planetary protection, and space research requires in situ capabilities. Steps toward reducing Earth-dependence for complex sample analysis began in 2016 with the amplification of DNA within the miniPCR thermal cycler and DNA sequencing with the MinION sequencer onboard the ISS; for both, samples were prepared on Earth. In 2017, these platforms synergistically enabled the in-situ identification of unknown bacteria collected and cultured from ISS surfaces, thereby shifting the paradigm that microbial cultures had to be returned to Earth. The following year, a culture-independent, swab-to-sequencer method further advanced spaceflight microbiology, demonstrating that culturing could be excluded and provided enhanced insight into the bacterial profile of ISS surfaces. Based on the success of these payloads in confirming the ability to meet crew health identification requirements and the benefits accompanying a culture-independent method, the BioMole Facility was established by the medical operations Crew Health Care Systems team. BioMole is the set of hardware, consumables, and procedures required to support sample preparation and nanopore sequencing onboard the ISS. BioMole goals include expanding sample sources, comparing data to previous methods, demonstrating onboard data analytics, and validating new hardware. To date, comparative surface analysis, molecular- and culture-based, has been completed. Additionally, the demonstration of a sample-to-answer process was achieved when BioMole data was processed onboard using the IBM Open Data and AI Edge software platform installed on the ISS-residing Spaceborne Computer-2. The taxonomic profiles generated from the edge analysis were as expected and paralleled that of the downlinked processed data.

20160001728,PRESENTATION,Management of Asymptomatic Renal Stones in Astronauts,"[""Reyes, David"",""Locke, James""]","Introduction: Management guidelines were created to screen and manage asymptomatic renal stones in U.S. astronauts. The risks for renal stone formation in astronauts due to bone loss and hypercalcuria are unknown. Astronauts have a stone risk which is about the same as commercial aviation pilots, which is about half that of the general population. However, proper management of this condition is still crucial to mitigate health and mission risks in the spaceflight environment. Methods: An extensive review of the literature and current aeromedical standards for the monitoring and management of renal stones was done. The NASA Flight Medicine Clinic's electronic medical record and Longitudinal Survey of Astronaut Health were also reviewed. Using this work, a screening and management algorithm was created that takes into consideration the unique operational environment of spaceflight. Results: Renal stone screening and management guidelines for astronauts were created based on accepted standards of care, with consideration to the environment of spaceflight. In the proposed algorithm, all astronauts will receive a yearly screening ultrasound for renal calcifications, or mineralized renal material (MRM). Any areas of MRM, 3 millimeters or larger, are considered a positive finding. Three millimeters approaches the detection limit of standard ultrasound, and several studies have shown that any stone that is 3 millimeters or less has an approximately 95 percent chance of spontaneous passage. For mission-assigned astronauts, any positive ultrasound study is followed by low-dose renal computed tomography (CT) scan, and flexible ureteroscopy if CT is positive. Other specific guidelines were also created. Discussion: The term ""MRM"" is used to account for small areas of calcification that may be outside the renal collecting system, and allows objectivity without otherwise constraining the diagnostic and treatment process for potentially very small calcifications of uncertain significance. However, a small asymptomatic MRM or stone within the renal collecting system may become symptomatic, and so affect launch and flight schedules, cause incapacitation during flight, and ultimately require medical evacuation. For exploration class missions, evacuation is unlikely. The new screening and management algorithm allows better management of mission risks, and will define the true incidence of renal stones in U.S. astronauts. This information will be used to refine future screening, countermeasures and treatment methods; and will also inform the needed capabilities to be flown on exploration-class missions.","[{""submissionId"":20160001728,""id"":""1dbb4d6a1c724b27b24a7fdd83f4df57"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160001728,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""09ab5ed5d01c47bcba2d30a4f588f779""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160001728,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""c9178be46e5d442d81433cc4a50525e8"",""id"":""50ef8c9963fb4d17a618a84349df3aae""}],""name"":""2016 Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2016)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""c9178be46e5d442d81433cc4a50525e8"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20150021960,""title"":""Management of Asymptomatic Renal Stones in Astronauts""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160001728
20140003146,ABSTRACT,Are Medications Involved in Vision and Intracrancial Pressure Changes Seen in Spaceflight?,"[""Faust, K. M."",""Wotring, V. E.""]","The Food and Drug Association Adverse Event Reports (FDA AER) from 2009-2011 were used to create a database from millions of known and suspected medication-related adverse events among the general public. Vision changes, sometimes associated with intracranial pressure changes (VIIP), have been noted in some long duration crewmembers. Changes in vision and blood pressure (which can subsequently affect intracranial pressure) are fairly common side effects of medications. The purpose of this study was to explore the possibility of medication involvement in crew VIIP symptoms. Reports of suspected medication-related adverse events may be filed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by medical professionals or consumers. Quarterly compilations of these reports are available for public download. Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) reports from 1/1/2009- 6/30/2012 were downloaded and compiled into a searchable database for this study. Reports involving individuals under the age of 18 and older than 65 were excluded from this analysis. Case reports involving chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and other serious conditions were also excluded. A scan of the medical literature for medication-related VIIP-like adverse events was used to create a list of suspect medications. These medications, as well as certain medications used frequently by ISS crew, were used to query the database. Queries for use of suspected medications were run, and the nature of the symptoms reported in those cases were tabulated. Symptoms searched in the FDA AERS were chosen to include the typical symptoms noted in crewmembers with VIIP. Vision symptoms searched were: visual acuity reduced, visual impairment, and vitreous floaters. Pressure changes included: abnormal sensation in eye, intracranial pressure increased, intraocular pressure increased, optic neuritis, optic neuropathy, and papilloedema. Limited demographic information is included with the FDA AERS; relevant data were also sorted by age and sex from each report. RESULTS Steroid-containing oral contraceptives had the highest number of reports associated with vision (n=166) and pressure symptoms (n=54). Corticosteroid-containing medications were also high; prednisone, for example, had 137 reports of vision issues and 79 of pressure issues. Pain relievers were also a medication class with vision and pressure-related adverse events reported. Common over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen, aspirin and ibuprofen each had multiple reports for both vision and pressure symptoms. Antimicrobial medications ciprofloxacin and diflucan were also associated with a number of vision and pressure-related AERS. Unexpectedly, pseudoephedrine and promethazine were mentioned in fewer than 20 reports each over the 3.5 years of data examined. The FDA AERS represents a wealth of data, but there are several limitations to its use. The data are entered by the public or medical professionals, but are not checked for accuracy or completeness and may even be entered multiple times. The causal relationship between a particular adverse event and a particular medication is not tested. The cases represent a broad spectrum of demographics, occupations, and health histories, and thus do not model the astronaut population well. There is no information on the frequency of use of a medication for comparison purposes; it is not possible to assign a rate for any particular adverse event. Nonetheless, there are compelling trends. Use of corticosteroid-containing medications, pain relievers (even over-the-counter), and oral contraceptives were associated with higher numbers of vision- or intracranial pressure-related adverse events. In general, there were more vision problems than pressure problems reported. Certain medications that were once suspected of playing a role in the crew VIIP syndrome, namely pseudoephedrine and promethazine, were found to have extremely low numbers of VIIP-like AERS in the FDA data. However, crew use of corticosteroid-containing medications and pain relievers may warrant additional investigation","[{""submissionId"":20140003146,""id"":""c196f5e8d709432ab6b47a3ec5ac6c0c"",""publicationDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140003146,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""e1f799d255d54fe4b59be6e8fae80ebe""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140003146,""endDate"":""2014-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""8ccaff322ecb48d2811364bf91d9f59d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ea57a97d56904dba851ab7d003868a41"",""id"":""74fedf7567614adf986d6f8b85db5bbb""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ea57a97d56904dba851ab7d003868a41"",""id"":""315677ca68aa481c81207a66de33a546""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Prograam Investigators'' Meeting"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""ea57a97d56904dba851ab7d003868a41"",""startDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140003146

20050070559,OTHER,An Algorithm for the Transport of Anisotropic Neutrons,"[""Tweed, J.""]","One major obstacle to human space exploration is the possible limitations imposed by the adverse effect of long-term exposure to the space environment. Even before human spaceflight began, the potentially brief exposure of astronauts to the very intense random solar particle events (SPE) were of great concern. A new challenge appears in deep space exploration from exposure to the low-intensity heavy-ion flux of the galactic cosmic rays (GCR) since the missions are of long duration and the accumulated GCR exposures can be high. Because cancer induction rates increase behind low to rather large thicknesses of aluminum shielding, according to available biological data on mammalian exposures to GCR like ions, the shield requirements for a Mars mission are prohibitively expensive in terms of mission launch costs. Therefore, a critical issue in the Human Exploration and Development of Space enterprise is cost effective mitigation of risk associated with ionizing radiation exposure. In order to estimate astronaut risk to GCR exposure and associated cancer risks and health hazards, it is necessary to do shield material studies. To determine an optimum radiation shield material it is necessary to understand nuclear interaction processes such as fragmentation and secondary particle production which is a function of energy dependent cross sections. This requires knowledge of material transmission characteristics either through laboratory testing or improved theoretical modeling. Here ion beam transport theory is of importance in that testing of materials in the laboratory environment generated by particle accelerators is a necessary step in materials development and evaluation for space use. The approximations used in solving the Boltzmann transport equation for the space setting are often not sufficient for laboratory work and those issues are a major emphasis of the present work.","[{""submissionId"":20050070559,""id"":""603a66b3ff094f97b46f3138016e0b41"",""publicationDate"":""2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NCC1-396""]",undefined,"[""Nuclear Physics""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050070559

Michelle""]","The Space Life Sciences directorate (SLSD) and Human Research Program (HRP) at NASA Johnson Space Center has implemented a system for managing human systems risks. These risks are defined as the health and performance risks posed to crew during and after spaceflight. Identification and evaluation of these risks has led to the identification of gaps in knowledge about the risks as well as gaps in technology needed to mitigate them. Traditional routes of closing technology gaps have, in some cases, proven to be too slow when a solution was required quickly. Therefore, certain gaps were used to drive the development of ""challenges"" for the scientific community. Partnering with open innovation service providers such as InnoCentive and Yet2.com, SLSD and HRP have decreased the amount of time from identification of a need to the evaluation of a solution. Although not all proposed solutions will result in a risk mitigation strategy or tool, the process has allowed faster evaluation of proposed solutions providing the researcher the ability to move to another possible solution if the first does not sufficiently address the problem. Moreover, this process engages the community outside of NASA and broadens the population from which to draw solutions. In the traditional grant funding structure, only those in the specific field will apply for the grant. However, using open innovation, solutions can come from individuals in many different fields. This can expand the general view of a field (way of thinking within a field) and the application of solutions form new fields while providing a pathway for the acquisition of novel solutions or refinements of current mitigations. Identification of the human systems risks has helped drive the development and evaluation of innovative solutions as well as engaging a broader scientific audience in working with NASA.","[{""submissionId"":20100036339,""id"":""e57fb36cb3db404e9082ff489a87c515"",""publicationDate"":""2010-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20100036339,""endDate"":""2011-05-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""82nd Annual Scientific Meeting of the Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Anchorage, AK"",""id"":""87e6620478cd44a4ac979f79eeb88be4"",""startDate"":""2011-05-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100036339

K."",""Gallo, C. A."",""DeWitt, J. K."",""Funk, J. H."",""Funk, N. W."",""Perusek, G. P."",""Sheehan, C. C."",""Lewandowski, B. E.""]","During long-duration spaceflight missions, astronauts exposure to microgravity without adequate countermeasures can result in losses of muscular strength and endurance, as well as loss of bone mass. As a countermeasure to this challenge, astronauts engage in resistive exercise during spaceflight to maintain their musculoskeletal function. The Hybrid Ultimate Lifting Kit (HULK) has been designed as a prototype exercise device for an exploration-class vehicle; the HULK features a much smaller footprint than previous devices such as the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) on the International Space Station (ISS), which makes the HULK suitable for extended spaceflight missions in vehicles with limited volume. As current ISS exercise countermeasure equipment represents an improvement over previous generations of such devices, the ARED is being employed as a benchmark of functional performance. This project involves the development of a biomechanical model of the deadlift exercise, and is novel in that it is the first exercise analyzed in this context to include the upper limbs in the loading path, in contrast to the squat, single-leg squat, and heel raise exercises also being modeled by our team. OpenSim software is employed to develop these biomechanical models of humans performing resistive exercises to assess and improve the new exercise device designs. Analyses include determining differences in joint and muscle forces when using different loading strategies with the device, comparing and contrasting with the ARED benchmark, and determining whether the loading is sufficient to maintain musculoskeletal health. During data collection, the number of repetitions, load, cadence, stance, and grip width are controlled in order to facilitate comparisons between loading configurations. To date, data have been collected for two human subjects performing the deadlift exercise on the HULK device using two different loading conditions.

20200001489,PRESENTATION,Space Radiation Induces Long Term Impact on the Cardiovascular System by the Activation of FYN Through Reactive Oxygen Species,"[""Beheshti, Afshin"",""Mcdonald, J. Tyson"",""Grabham, Peter"",""Costes, Sylvain V.""]","Space radiation can damage the cardiovascular system and thus is an important health risk factor for astronauts during long-term space missions. We utilized publicly available transcriptomic data through NASA's GeneLab platform (genelab.nasa.gov) to determine cardiovascular system response to space radiation. GeneLab is an open repository that houses all NASA related omics experiments including on the International Space Station (ISS) and related radiation ground studies. We analyzed 3 datasets from GeneLab: GLDS-117 and GLDS-109, which are ground studies of cardiomyocytes followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 90cGy of proton at 1GeV and 15cGy of 56Fe at 1GeV; and GLDS-52, human endothelial cells (HUVECs) that were cultured for 10 days on the ISS. The ground studies were designed to characterize the long-term impact following space irradiation on cardiomyocytes for 5 different time points up to 28 days after irradiation. Our analysis was guided by the hypothesis that there are common persistent molecules affecting the cardiovascular system due to radiation effects during spaceflight. Endothelial cells are known to directly regulate the development and activity of cardiomyocytes, and thus their response to spaceflight should be highly correlated with cardiomyocytes. To investigate our hypothesis, we identified the molecular pathways that were modified for all time points compared across both radiation on the ground and the pathways found in HUVECs flown in the ISS. We found the following key results related to the cardiovascular systems: 1) space radiation downregulate ROS functions; and 2) the key/driving genes: FYN, LCK, AKT1 are upregulated and LYN and FOS are downregulated with FYN being the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation. It is worth noting the activation of FYN is a key event which prevents cardiac cell death and ROS production. From our study we thus hypothesize that a feedback loop occurs from the oxidative stress caused by space radiation that upregulates FYN which in turn reduces ROS levels and thus ROS pathways, preventing cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell death and thus protecting the cardiovascular systems. We believe that this is a novel mechanism for space radiation induced cardiovascular risk directly linking radiation ground studies to spaceflight","[{""submissionId"":20200001489,""id"":""d208853dc82a4717870a08cc4cb9d92a"",""publicationDate"":""2018-09-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20200001489,""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Great Falls, VA, United States"",""id"":""612ef1822ba045a6ba55681c41a37ab7""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20200001489,""endDate"":""2018-09-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Great Falls, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""54df5bce7be24c8fa69632f317934a25"",""id"":""7fef04de035f4f3287a3db6cbd59578a""}],""name"":""Radiation Research Society Meeting"",""location"":""Chicago, IL"",""id"":""54df5bce7be24c8fa69632f317934a25"",""startDate"":""2018-09-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20200001489
20205011728,PRESENTATION,Clinical Decision Support - Concepts of Operation,"[""B. Russell"",""M. Krihak"",""S. Shetye"",""K. Martin"",""T. Shaw""]","We are entering a new era in space exploration to return to the moon and explore Mars. Crew members operating independently during long duration space exploration missions will require a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to increase autonomy by augmenting their knowledge, skills and abilities in different scenarios.  Significant changes to in-flight and habitat medical care due to constraints on mass, volume, power, crew time and medical evacuation capabilities are needed to increase crew autonomy and self-reliance in decision making and task performance.  The Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element of the Human Research Program (HRP) pushes the boundary of space medical systems to advance the care of astronauts on future exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit by identifying and testing next-generation medical care and crew health maintenance technologies. 
Clinical decision support (CDS) presents knowledge and data in a context aware manner to augment a crew members’ knowledge, skills and abilities during the process of observation, orientation, decisions and action. A comprehensive crew health and performance CDSS is required to augment crew capability and will be used in different scenarios for several reasons. In general, the CDSS’s role is to assist the crew in prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment of crew health and performance related conditions that may arise in exploration spaceflight. For example, CDSS would assist a high acuity scenario such as a heart attack by supplying clear instructions, vital signs and treatment reminders. A lower severity scenario such as kidney stone risk could interface to vehicle systems and display more complex predictive data during a diagnosis. A CDSS needs to contribute to successful missions by maintaining a high performing crew who can potentially exhibit countless medical conditions related to derangements from the space environment (sleep, cognition, nutrition and exercise) as well as conditions intrinsic to humans anywhere. While supporting the crew’s ability to make sound clinical decisions is desirable in any mission, it is essential for exploration missions with significant communication delays, no evacuation capability, and extended exposure to the flight environment. Such missions correspond with medical Level of Care V (LOC V), the highest level specified in NASA-STD-3001.  The project focuses on CDS implementation research to derive requirements for LOC V, where the need for increased autonomy results in new practices and the inclusion of non-clinical data, such as vehicle environmental measures and physical exercise results, from other human and vehicle domains and advanced analytics.  
The CDS project describes how the CDSS is intended to be used by defining concepts of operations (ConOps). The process to derive ConOps focuses on increased autonomy that reduces the likelihood and consequences of accepted medical conditions. These crew health and performance inputs are grouped by common datasets and analysis models. Use cases are derived to research new clinical scenarios, architectural development and workflows. Implementation research is conducted with protypes to inform assumptions and derive requirements. The project also establishes how externally developed analysis and approaches can be added to expand a clinical decision support system and thus highlight how a comprehensive system can be globally developed with collaborators. 
This presentation will cover example scenarios from the CDS ConOps and the method to derive them. One example scenario will be CDSS alerting an increased kidney stone risk during a mission, with diagnosis and treatment options provided during the intervention.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20205011728,""endDate"":""2021-02-04T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA HRP""}},""meetingId"":""8dd78e5cb4cf44aca75755b069428a8b"",""id"":""c13ffd3a073345c3a3586b7ad8a96db4""}],""name"":""2021 Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""8dd78e5cb4cf44aca75755b069428a8b"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/ddb36a0a-6937-49ba-8eca-086ce232d767/summary"",""startDate"":""2021-02-01T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205011728
20110015913,ABSTRACT,Managing Toxicological Risks: The Legacy of Shuttle Operations,"[""James, John T.""]","Space toxicology greatly matured as a result of research and operations associated with the Shuttle. Materials offgassing had been a manageable concern since the Apollo days, but we learned to pay careful attention to compounds that could escape containment, to combustion events, to toxic propellants, to overuse of utility compounds, and to microbial and human metabolites. We also learned that flying real-time hardware to monitor air pollutants was a pathway with unanticipated speed bumps. Each new orbiter was tested for any excess offgassing products that could pollute the air during flight. In the late 1990s toxicologists and safety experts developed a 5-level toxicity rating system to guide containment of toxic compounds. This system is now in use aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Several combustion events during Shuttle Mir and also during Shuttle free-flight impelled toxicologists to identify hardware capable of monitoring toxic products; however, rapid adaptation of the hardware for the unique conditions of spaceflight caused unexpected missteps. Current and planned combustion analyzers would be useful to commercial partners that wish to manage the risk of health effects from thermal events. Propellants received special attention during the Shuttle program because of the possibility of bringing them into the habitable volume on extravehicular activity suits. Monitors for the airlocks were developed to mitigate this risk. Utility materials, such as lubricants, posed limited toxicological problems because water was not recovered. One clearly documented case of microbial metabolites polluting the Shuttle atmosphere was noted, and this has implications for commercial flights and control of microbes. Finally, carbon dioxide, the major human metabolite, episodically presented air quality problems aboard Shuttle, especially when nominal air flows were obstructed. Commercial vehicles must maintain robust air circulation given the anticipated high density of human occupants.","[{""submissionId"":20110015913,""id"":""d247dd87af3a4fef912f977a4e7fdadb"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20110015913,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States"",""id"":""07d38f4ea05a4af689f0a0d9ab6197dd""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110015913,""endDate"":""2012-05-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""5a96a4e012f143799367ab0054722f69"",""id"":""7540732d575a4c3e9297eaf827524c9c""}],""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association meeting"",""location"":""Atlanta, GA"",""id"":""5a96a4e012f143799367ab0054722f69"",""startDate"":""2012-05-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110015913

20220009643,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Investigating Biological Responses to Deep Space Radiation for Missions Beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using Yeast,"[""Kyra Keenan"",""Lauren Courtney Liddell"",""Sergio Renan Santa Maria""]","To enable long-term spaceflight missions and establish habitation on the Moon and Mars, we require a comprehensive understanding of the effects of chronic deep space radiation exposure on humans. BioSentinel is NASA’s first biological CubeSat to venture beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). It utilizes Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) as a model organism to study biological responses to deep space radiation. Yeast share significant genetic homology with humans, including basic cellular metabolism and DNA repair mechanisms. In addition, unlike human cell cultures, yeast can survive the duration and constraints of a deep space mission.
 
BioSentinel measures biological responses using an optical system and alamarBlue oxidation-reduction (redox) dye. Two strains of yeast are studied - a wild-type and a rad51 mutant strain that is deficient in DNA repair. Changes in metabolism and growth are monitored throughout the nominal 6-month mission.

Preliminary tests indicate a significant change in the alamarBlue response to low-dose ionizing radiation (IR). Additionally, rad51 cells have shown an IR dose-dependent decrease in glucose uptake and accumulation of oxidized NADH (NAD+). These biomolecules are involved in reactions responsible for basic cell processes, including growth and development, signaling, and respiration. The current study expanded upon previous data by exposing yeast to deep space-relevant radiation. Glucose and NADH/NAD+ assays were conducted on yeast subjected to varying dosages of high-energy Fe-56 and simulated galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). The resulting data was analyzed using Excel and GraphPad Prism. A particular focus was to identify biomolecules resulting from aerobic respiration, which requires the presence of oxygen, or anaerobic processes.
  
As long-term spaceflight missions draw near, it is increasingly important to characterize biological processes affected by the conditions of deep space. Studying biomolecular damage caused by deep space radiation may enable the development of engineering controls or biomedical therapeutics that mitigate health complications for future astronauts.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220009643,""endDate"":""2022-11-12T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""40e292dade5754e3979554f9c3646d0e"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Leidos (United States)"",""location"":""Reston, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""a48c156989c6475fb46869f36951fa09"",""id"":""91fa9e8ba2144ba8a5c2322ff9342f35""},{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""a48c156989c6475fb46869f36951fa09"",""id"":""76cd32536cc64ce4bad2f76a10617beb""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) Annual Conference"",""location"":""Houston, Texas"",""id"":""a48c156989c6475fb46869f36951fa09"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2022-meeting/"",""startDate"":""2022-11-09T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.07.01.02.01""]",undefined,"[""Space Radiation"",""Lunar and Planetary Science and Exploration""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220009643

20230007569,PRESENTATION,NASA Commercial Crew Program and Medical Operational Challenges,"[""Joseph P Dervay""]","BACKGROUND: NASA embarked on the Commercial Crew Program to launch astronauts into low-earth orbit from US soil and dock with the International Space Station (ISS).  The eventual industry providers selected were SpaceX (SpX) and Boeing.  These commercial transportation systems are vital to ensure crew availability on ISS for research and discovery.

 OVERVIEW: NASA/SpaceX Demo-2 (DM2) mission launched from the Kennedy Space Center in 2020 as the historic first crewed test-flight of the Crew Dragon spacecraft with two NASA Astronauts onboard. DM2 represented the first flight in 9-years from US soil since STS-135 in 2011. The 63-day mission ended with splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, the first US water recovery in 45-years since Apollo-Soyuz.  Validation of system hardware and operations allowed four-person crews to launch on subsequently missions (Crew-1, Crew-2, Crew-3, Crew-4, Crew-5 to date), which included International Partner crewmembers.                  

DISCUSSION: A multitude of operational, training, medical, and technical issues needed to be addressed between NASA Medical Operations, the commercial provider SpaceX, and the Department of Defense. These included Flight rule development, occupant protection, pressurized suit testing, communication plans during mission phases, and emergency simulations for supporting Flight Surgeons and Biomedical Engineers.  In providing crew experience with expected launch and entry G-force profile, Centrifuge training was established. Preventive health measures via the Health Stabilization Program were especially vital during the global COVID-19 pandemic.  Unique aspects arise for SpX Dragon parachute splashdown and shipboard recovery operations in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. The new Commercial Crew Program is indeed a wonderfully challenging and exciting era for human spaceflight.

20090002627,ABSTRACT,A History of Space Toxicology Mishaps: Lessons Learned and Risk Management,"[""James, John T.""]","After several decades of human spaceflight, the community of space-faring nations has accumulated a diverse and sometimes harrowing history of toxicological events that have plagued human space endeavors almost from the very beginning. Lessons have been learned in ground-based test beds and others were discovered the hard way - when human lives were at stake in space. From such lessons one can build a risk-management framework for toxicological events to minimize the probability of a harmful exposure, while recognizing that we cannot foresee all events. Space toxicologists have learned that relatively harmless compounds can be converted by air revitalization systems into compounds that cause serious harm to the crew. Our toxic risk management strategy now includes an assessment of the fate of any compound that might be released into the atmosphere. Propellants are highly toxic compounds, yet we have not always been able to thoroughly isolate the crew from exposure to these toxicants. Leakage of fluids from systems has resulted in hazardous conditions at times, and the behavior of such compounds inside a spacecraft has taught us how to manage potentially harmful escapes should they occur. Potential combustion events are an ever-present threat to the wellbeing of the crew. Such events have been sufficiently common that we have learned that one cannot judge the health threat of a given fire by the magnitude of the event. Management of such risks demands monitoring of combustion products. In the category of unpredictable toxic events, if one assumes that fires are predictable, we can place experience with toxic microbial metabolites, upsets during repair operations, and discharges from filters that have accumulated a substantial load of pollutants in their absorption beds. Management of such events requires a broad-spectrum, real-time analytical capability to discern the identity and concentrations of pollutants if they enter the atmosphere. Adverse events are an integral part of any human activity, and the spacefaring community must learn as much as possible from mistakes and near misses.","[{""submissionId"":20090002627,""id"":""154cf45b39b448d991e1ca5e773c8fb9"",""publicationDate"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20090002627,""endDate"":""2009-07-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""2fb8633154d94728aec2c57afa709b46"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc."",""location"":""Warrendale, PA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""19ad0ee0a32a4bfbbac0f540e37ecd9f"",""id"":""ffea5711991948429d654d447ecf8d48""}],""name"":""ICES Meeting"",""location"":""Savannah, GA"",""id"":""19ad0ee0a32a4bfbbac0f540e37ecd9f"",""startDate"":""2009-07-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090002627

The NEK complex includes a Mission Control Center for communications and monitoring of crew members. In an effort to begin these collaborations, a 2-week mission is planned for 2017. In this mission, scientific studies will be conducted to assess facility capabilities in preparation for longer duration missions. A second follow-on 2-week mission may be planned for early in 2018. In future years, long duration missions of 4, 8 and 12 months are being considered. Missions will include scenarios that simulate for example, transit to and from asteroids, the moon, or other interplanetary travel. Mission operations will be structured to include stressors such as, high workloads, communication delays, and sleep deprivation. Studies completed at the NEK will support International Space Station expeditions, and future exploration missions. Topics studied will include communication, crew autonomy, cultural diversity, human factors, and medical capabilities.

20240011871,ABSTRACT,Private Astronaut Post-Mission Debrief Interviews Study,"[""L B Landon"",""L G Morissette"",""S T Bell""]","<b>BACKGROUND</b>
The commercialization of space will increasingly include individuals that are not rigorously-selected, highly-trained professional astronauts. Private astronaut missions (PAMs), such as Axiom-1 in 2022, will continue to travel to the International Space Station in the coming years, but the risk of integrating private astronauts with NASA astronauts has not been clearly quantified nor mitigated. An earlier internal NASA operations assessment, which consisted of a comprehensive literature review and interviews of current NASA experts, found that PAMs are likely to increase the risk to NASA astronauts during integrated missions (Landon, Whiting, Russell, Schorn, Passmore, & Roma, 2022).
There are ongoing efforts at NASA to mitigate concerns from a medical, psychological, and technical perspective. NASA experts are working closely with PAM providers to offer recommendations and best practices beyond the limits of requirements to ensure crew health and safety. However, efforts are siloed between groups to some extent, and with the rate of PAMs likely to increase, a more comprehensive and integrated process is needed to reduce the burden on NASA resources.

<b>AIMS</b>
The purpose of this project is to understand private astronauts’ motivations for journeying to space, their pre-mission preparation period, and their experiences in space. Data will be collected via private astronaut post-mission debrief interviews. This data will inform training needs and in-mission support needed for missions that include private astronauts; the preparation NASA astronauts and mission support personnel will need to work with these integrated crews; and gaps in knowledge to guide research and countermeasure development.

Our study aims to (1) Characterize risks posed by commercialization and private astronaut crew integration in spaceflight operations, as it relates to Team, Human Systems Integration Architecture (HSIA), and Behavioral Medicine (BMed) Risks, (2) Recommend potential countermeasures and identify gaps in current research. Countermeasures may be related to crew selection and composition, training, crew support systems (e.g., medical/psychological support, support from Mission Control, on-board resources), and habitability and human factors design.

<b>METHOD</b>
The BHP Lab will conduct 30-minute interviews with up to eight (8) private astronaut mission (PAM) astronauts (e.g., Axiom) and spaceflight participants (e.g., SFPs or “free flyers” on Polaris Dawn) per year from 2024-2030 to discuss knowledge gaps and needs related to selection and assessment, crew composition, training, crew support systems (e.g., medical/psychological support, support from Mission Control, onboard resources), and habitability and human factors design, which may influence the risk to NASA astronauts. Interviews will then be coded using thematic analysis and interpreted with the assistance of lexical analysis software (e.g., LIWC).  As of the end of 2024, we have collected data from one PAM crew. At the conclusion of data collection in 2030, a final report will be prepared integrating all data collected by 2031.

<b>SUMMARY</b>
Post-return interviews of private astronauts are being conducted to understand their experiences and inform training and countermeasures to ensure the safety of all who journey to the ISS.","[{""submissionId"":20240011871,""id"":""46bb31cef5b44203991b7a28becc480c"",""publicationDate"":""2025-01-28T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240011871,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""91824716a75d4bf593edadff5954b6d3"",""id"":""86e6aee49ed8444a9baffa4a351b46e5""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""91824716a75d4bf593edadff5954b6d3"",""url"":""https://www.nasa.gov/hrp-iws-2025/"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B"",""10449.02.03.08.54.2300  ""]",undefined,"[""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240011871
20250009282,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Why Moon and Mars? How NASA’s Moon to Mars Architecture Paves the Way to Mars,"[""Lori Glaze"",""Lakiesha Hawkins"",""Nujoud Merancy"",""Julie Grantier"",""George Nelson"",""Eric Maier"",""Sarah Luna"",""Greg Mercer"",""Danny Baird""]","The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is establishing a long-term presence on the Moon to prepare humanity for the journey to Mars. Crewed lunar and Mars exploration are not two separate efforts; they are deeply entwined. NASA’s Moon to Mars Architecture [1] — as described in the agency’s Architecture Definition Document [2] — applies a systems engineering approach to achieve the nation’s Moon to Mars Objectives [3], resulting in an evolutionary roadmap that proves capabilities needed for Mars at the Moon while developing requisite flight experience and industrial base.  

NASA has over 60 years of experience in sending humans to — and operating in — low Earth orbit, including two decades of continuous human presence in space aboard the International Space Station. The agency has comparatively little experience with lunar exploration — nine Apollo missions on and around the Moon across five years. Thus far, humanity has only explored Mars with robots.  

This paper highlights the major differences between these destinations, including the different gravitational
environments, distances, communication delay times, human health and performance challenges, and flight dynamics parameters that a mission must account for. These challenges comprise four main facets of the Moon to Mars endeavour: national posture, engineering and design, operations, and the human system. This paper’s analysis underscores that the first missions to Mars will be among the most arduous engineering challenges in history, far beyond anything yet attempted in spaceflight.  

To ensure that the first human missions to Mars safely achieve their objectives, NASA will build experience in deep space operations by exploring the Moon. Proving Mars-forward technologies and capabilities during lunar exploration missions will reduce the risk of crewed Mars missions and help NASA develop concepts of operation for long-term, deep space exploration.  

NASA is not waiting for its return to the Moon to begin planning for human Mars missions. Initial planning for Mars, including documenting key driving decisions, has already begun, enabling lunar and Martian exploration to inform one another. This parallel development approach ensures that the lessons NASA learns by returning to the Moon empowers the success of Mars missions, enabling the agency to achieve its exploration goals for the benefit of all humanity.",[],"[{""country"":""AU"",""submissionId"":20250009282,""endDate"":""2025-10-03T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""d843f4f3dd0352f2808ffc1b2eadd095"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""European Space Agency"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""f101153a284d40499321e31e9ab8b5ff"",""id"":""2c2181b9710a49a48fdeb8f0869bd0cf""}],""name"":""76th International Astronautical Congress (IAC)"",""location"":""Sydney"",""id"":""f101153a284d40499321e31e9ab8b5ff"",""url"":""https://www.iac2025.org/"",""startDate"":""2025-09-29T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""80KSC023CA006""]",undefined,"[""Lunar and Planetary Science and Exploration""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250009282

A."",""Vizzeri, G."",""Tabbi, G."",""Zanello, S. B."",""Ploutz-Snyder, R.""]","Research by NASA has established that significant risks for visual impairment in association with increased intracranial pressure (VIIP) are incurred by microgravity spaceflight, especially long-duration missions. Impairments include decreased near visual acuity, posterior globe flattening, choroidal folds, optic disc edema, and cotton wool spots. Much remains to be learned about the etiology of VIIP before effective countermeasures can be developed. Contributions of retinal vascular remodeling to the etiology of VIIP have not yet been investigated, primarily due to the current lack of ophthalmic tools for precisely measuring progressive pathophysiological remodeling of the retinal microvasculature. Although ophthalmic science and clinical practice are now highly sophisticated at detecting indirect, secondary signs of vascular remodeling such as cotton wool spots that arise during the progression of retinal vascular diseases, methods for quantifying direct, primary vascular changes are not yet established. To help develop insightful analysis of retinal vascular remodeling for aerospace medicine, we will map and quantify by our innovative VESsel GENeration Analysis (VESGEN) software the remodeling status of retinal blood vessels in crew members before and after ISS missions, and in healthy human subjects before and after head-down tilt bed rest. For this proof-of-concept study, we hypothesize that pathophysiological remodeling of retinal blood vessels occurs in coordination with microgravity-induced fluid shifts prior to development of visual impairments. VESGEN analysis in previous research supported by the US National Institutes of Health identified surprising new opportunities to regenerate retinal vessels during early-stage progression of the visually impairing, potentially blinding disease, diabetic retinopathy.","[{""submissionId"":20160003292,""id"":""c141dc1e60c44c07acafc4327d966607"",""publicationDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160003292,""endDate"":""2014-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""dc66c393006f496d919aad3bcd077df9"",""id"":""5cb4e858e6c744d2acd056005483805e""}],""name"":""2014 Human Research Program Investigator''s Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""dc66c393006f496d919aad3bcd077df9"",""startDate"":""2014-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160003292

Teams of students (aged 8-12) learn principles of healthy eating and exercise, compete for points by finishing training modules, and get excited about their future as ""fit explorers."" The 18 core exercises (targeting strength, endurance, coordination, balance, spatial awareness, and more) involve the same types of skills that astronauts learn in their training and use in spaceflight. This first-of-its-kind cooperative outreach program has allowed 14 space agencies and various partner institutions to work together to address quality health/fitness education, challenge students to be more physically active, increase awareness of the importance of lifelong health and fitness, teach students how fitness plays a vital role in human performance for exploration, and inspire and motivate students to pursue careers in STEM fields.

NASA’s Informing Mission Planning via Analysis of Complex Tradespaces tool (IMPACT) applies Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) methodology to estimate these outcomes.

OVERVIEW: As NASA prepares to return to the Moon, medical system planning has already begun for extended Artemis missions, which will see humans spending months at a time in cis-lunar space and on the surface of the Moon. The Long Duration Lunar Orbital and Lunar Surface (LDLOLS) design reference mission (DRM) lasts 9 months, including 3 months on the lunar surface, and involves 2 male and 2 female crewmembers. LDLOLS assumes no extravehicular activities (EVAs) in orbit, but, while on the lunar surface, involves 2-4 EVAs/month in a pressurized rover and 2-4 EVAs/month in an unpressurized rover or on foot. This DRM assumes a physician level Crew Medical Officer with commensurate knowledge, skills, and abilities. The IMPACT tool was utilized to estimate in-flight medical risk for this mission. More specifically, 100,000 simulations of this DRM were modeled, and overall estimates for loss of crew life (LOCL), need for evacuation (RTDC; return to definitive care), and crew task time lost (TTL; a measure of disability) were calculated. A recommended medical capability set, with appropriate mass and volume constraints, was also generated. 

DISCUSSION: This abstract reviews the IMPACT-derived risk for these mission outcomes with and without treatment, a macroscopic look at the total mass and volume necessary for full diagnostic and treatment capability, and how these change with input mission parameters.

The Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO) experiment generated a microbial census of ISS environments using advanced molecular microbial community analyses along with traditional culture-based methods. Since the “omics” methodologies generated an extensive microbial census, significant insights into spaceflight-induced changes in the populations of beneficial and/or potentially harmful microbes were gained. Surface samples were collected from several ISS surface locations from three flight opportunities, and were returned to Earth via the Soyuz TMA-14M or the Space X Dragon capsule. In addition to cultivation methods, viable microbial burden, iTag-based sequencing, and metagenome analyses were carried out. The cultivable microbial bioburden differed by location and sampling event. Exploring the ISS environmental microbiome revealed presence of opportunistic pathogens and antibiotic resistant microbes. Genes involved in ATP binding cassette transporters, two component systems, and beta-lactam resistance were among a diverse set of metabolic and genetic information processing pathways. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 50 ISS strains exhibiting resistance to various antibiotics was carried out. The antibiotic resistant genes deduced from the WGS were compared with the resistomes generated directly from the gene pool of the environmental samples. Two unique Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from the ISS were characterized and compared to the experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. A virulence assessment in a neutrophil-deficient larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis indicated that both ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 were significantly more lethal compared to Af293 and CEA10. The findings from this Environmental “Omics” project should be exploited to enhance human health and well-being of a closed system. In other words, the ISS-MO research aims to ""translate"" findings in fundamental research into medical practice (pathogen detection) and meaningful health outcomes (countermeasure development).","[{""submissionId"":20210007759,""publisher"":""Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2017"",""id"":""efde537f1c43471e9747621955beb8d0"",""publicationDate"":""2017-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,[],[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210007759
20120007439,ABSTRACT,"Surface, Water, and Air Biocharacterization (SWAB) Flight Experiment","[""Castro, V. A."",""Ott, C. M."",""Pierson, D. L.""]","The determination of risk from infectious disease during spaceflight missions is composed of several factors including both the concentration and characteristics of the microorganisms to which the crew are exposed. Thus, having a good understanding of the microbial ecology aboard spacecraft provides the necessary information to mitigate health risks to the crew. While preventive measures are taken to minimize the presence of pathogens on spacecraft, medically significant organisms have been isolated from both the Mir and International Space Station (ISS). Historically, the method for isolation and identification of microorganisms from spacecraft environmental samples depended upon their growth on culture media. Unfortunately, only a fraction of the organisms may grow on a specific culture medium, potentially omitting those microorganisms whose nutritional and physical requirements for growth are not met. To address this bias in our understanding of the ISS environment, the Surface, Water, and Air Biocharacterization (SWAB) Flight Experiment was designed to investigate and develop monitoring technology to provide better microbial characterization. For the SWAB flight experiment, we hypothesized that environmental analysis using non-culture-based technologies would reveal microorganisms, allergens, and microbial toxins not previously reported in spacecraft, allowing for a more complete health assessment. Key findings during this experiment included: a) Generally, advanced molecular techniques were able to reveal a few organisms not recovered using culture-based methods; however, there is no indication that current monitoring is ""missing"" any medically significant bacteria or fungi. b) Molecular techniques have tremendous potential for microbial monitoring, however, sample preparation and data analysis present challenges for spaceflight hardware. c) Analytical results indicate that some molecular techniques, such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), can be much less sensitive than culture-based methods. d) More sensitive molecular techniques, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), were able to identify viral DNA from ISS environments, suggesting potential transfer of the organism between crewmembers. In addition, the hardware selected for this experiment represented advances for next-generation sample collection. The advanced nature of this collection hardware was noted, when the Sartorius MD8 Air Port air sampler from the SWAB experiment remained on board ISS at the request of JAXA investigators, who intend to use it in completion of their microbial ecology experiment.","[{""submissionId"":20120007439,""id"":""e67dafe723014c8dbf895b56e1cb10c4"",""publicationDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20120007439,""endDate"":""2012-02-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""8ccaff322ecb48d2811364bf91d9f59d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""0367664fe24143ffb9b7dd037b41addc"",""id"":""3bfcce3978054c6abeb0728f163363d9""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigator''s Workshop"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""0367664fe24143ffb9b7dd037b41addc"",""startDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120007439

The success of present and future autonomous technology in exploration spaceflight is ultimately dependent upon safe and efficient interaction with the human operator. Optimal interaction is particularly important for surface missions during highly coordinated extravehicular activity (EVA), which consists of high physical and cognitive demands with limited ground support. Crew functional state may be affected by a number of variables including workload, stress, and motivation. Real-time assessments of crew state that do not require a crewmember’s time and attention to complete will be especially important to assess operational performance and behavioral health during flight. In response to the need for objective, passive assessment of crew state, the aim of this work is to develop an accurate and precise prediction model of human functional state for surface EVA using multi-modal psychophysiological sensing. The psychophysiological monitoring approach relies on extracting a set of features from physiological signals and using these features to classify an operator’s cognitive state. This work aims to compile a non-invasive sensor suite to collect physiological data in real-time. Training data during cognitive and more complex functional tasks will be used to develop a classifier to discriminate high and low cognitive workload crew states. The classifier will then be tested in an operationally relevant EVA simulation to predict cognitive workload over time. Once a crew state is determined, further research into specific countermeasures, such as decision support systems, would be necessary to optimize the automation and improve crew state and operational performance.","[{""submissionId"":20190032493,""id"":""c24ee60fb15846f49d5eec15f37545f4"",""publicationDate"":""2019-09-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United Kingdom"",""submissionId"":20190032493,""endDate"":""2019-09-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""fc1a0f811aff41aaa9b19d2658edffb8"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Nokia Corp."",""location"":""Fukushima, Japan""}},""meetingId"":""df340169c29e4e7686e1ff74695b5fe0"",""id"":""f5844e2496c448cfaf0d63711a4b6ec7""}],""name"":""ISWC/UBICOMP 2019"",""location"":""London, Enland"",""id"":""df340169c29e4e7686e1ff74695b5fe0"",""startDate"":""2019-09-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190032493
20110023193,ABSTRACT,"Compact, Controlled Resistance Exercise Device","[""Paulus, David C."",""DeWitt, John K."",""Reich, Alton J."",""Shaw, James E."",""Deaconu, Stelu S.""]","Spaceflight leads to muscle and bone atrophy. Isoinertial (free-weight) exercises provide a sufficient stimulus to elicit increases in both muscle strength and bone mineral density in Earth-based studies. While exercise equipment is in use on the International Space Station for crewmember health maintenance, current devices are too large to place in a transport vehicle or small spacecraft. Therefore, a portable computer controlled resistance exercise device is being developed that is able to simulate the inertial loading experienced when lifting a mass on Earth. This portable device weighs less than 50 lb and can simulate the resistance of lifting and lowering up to 600 lb of free-weights. The objective is to allow crewmembers to perform resistance exercise with loads capable of maintaining muscle and bone health. The device is reconfigurable and allows for the performance of typical Earth-based free-weight exercises.

The technology is much more compact, portable, low power and potentially more low cost compared to other medical image technologies, making it very well suited for medical aerospace and spaceflight applications. EIT technology’s main drawback has been low image resolution, and consequently improving EIT resolution is the primary research goal, as well as increasing imaging speed for real time animation imaging. In a relatively short time the BERL group has brought together design plans, technical resources and has built and tested hardware with the purpose of improving EIT imaging technology. EIT prototype system development plans and system designs have been made to target needed EIT technical improvement in electronic and computer hardware as well as EIT software technology. New hardware design and fabrication resources and technologies have been brought together through resourceful use of existing equipment and software at BERL, and a significant advance has been made in custom electronic hardware prototyping capabilities in collaboration with EFAL, for mutual benefit for both NASA KSC laboratories. BERL has gained significant EIT software capability and tested EIT imaging algorithm code through collaboration with an internationally recognized EIT software development and research forum. A new custom workstation has been developed, built and tested using internal resources, equipment and expertise, that includes a new state-of-the-art massively parallel technology that is commercially available. Custom prototype hardware has been designed and tested, a high priority electronic design, key to improving electronic performance and image quality, has been researched and tested in four designs, with a summary of test results of the selected design illustrated here. The selected design performance exceeds the developed EIT design hardware specifications.","[{""submissionId"":20230015126,""publisher"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""id"":""86c2ec608eb24a629796a868a0e5056d"",""publicationDate"":""2013-08-12T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230015126

This change can already be seen in the dramatic increase in the availability and use of wearable health and activity monitors. These devices continuously monitor the wearer using on-­‐body sensors and wireless communication. They provide feedback that can be used to improve physical health and performance. Smart watches and head mounted displays are also receiving a great deal of commercial attention, providing immediate access to information via graphical displays, as well as additional sensing features. For the purposes of the Wearable Technology CLUSTER, wearable technology is broadly defined as any electronic sensing, human interfaces, computing, or communication that is mounted on the body. Current commercially available wearable devices primarily house electronics in rigid packaging to provide protection from flexing, moisture, and other contaminants. NASA mentors are interested in this approach, but are also interested in direct integration of electronics into clothing to enable more comfortable systems. For human spaceflight, wearable technology holds a great deal of promise for significantly improving safety, efficiency, autonomy, and research capacity for the crew in space and support personnel on the ground. Specific capabilities of interest include: Continuous biomedical monitoring for research and detection of health problems. Environmental monitoring for individual exposure assessments and alarms. Activity monitoring for responsive robotics and environments. Multi-modal caution and warning using tactile, auditory, and visual alarms. Wireless, hands-free, on-demand voice communication. Mobile, on-demand access to space vehicle and robotic displays and controls. Many technical challenges must be overcome to realize these wearable technology applications. For example, to make a wearable device that is both functional and comfortable for long duration wear, developers must strive to reduce electronic mass and volume while also addressing constraints imposed by the body attachment method. Depending on the application, the device must be placed in a location that the user can see and reach, and that provides the appropriate access to air and the wearer's skin. Limited power is available from body-­‐worn batteries and heat must be managed to prevent discomfort. If the clothing is to be washed, there are additional durability and washability hurdles that traditional electronics are not designed to address. Finally, each specific capability has unique technical challenges that will likely require unique solutions. In addition to the technical challenges, development of wearable devices is made more difficult by the diversity of skills required and the historic lack of collaboration across domains. Wearable technology development requires expertise in textiles engineering, apparel design, software and computer engineering, electronic design and manufacturing, human factors engineering, and application-­‐specific fields such as acoustics, medical devices, and sensing. Knowledge from each of these domains must be integrated to create functional and comfortable devices. For this reason, the diversity of knowledge and experience represented in the Wearable Technology is critical to overcoming the fundamental challenges in the field.

Most ISS exercise countermeasures system (CMS) equipment rely heavily on the use of textile and wire ropes to transmit resistive loads and provide stability in a microgravity environment. For a variety of reasons, including challenges in simulating microgravity environments for testing and limits on time available for life cycle testing, the textiles and wire ropes have contributed significantly to on-orbit planned and unplanned maintenance time. As a result, continued ground testing and on-orbit experience since the first expedition on the ISS in 2000 provide valuable data and lessons learned in materials selection, applications, and design techniques to increase service life of these ropes. This paper will present a review of the development and failure history of textile and wire ropes for four exercise countermeasure systems-the Treadmill with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (TVIS) System, Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (CEVIS) System, Interim Resistive Exercise Device (IRED), and the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED)-to identify lessons learned in order to improve future systems. These lessons learned, paired with thorough testing on the ground, offer a forward path towards reduced maintenance time and up-mass for future space missions.","[{""submissionId"":20160008095,""id"":""12d2047df3b94444a72b5c984de6c9e5"",""publicationDate"":""2017-03-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160008095,""name"":""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"",""location"":""New York, NY, United States"",""id"":""d9b25ac62e5a4578af85449aa5e118b2""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160008095,""endDate"":""2017-03-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"",""location"":""New York, NY, United States""}},""meetingId"":""c9ce77f2e6da48f1b392fc97b9bcd454"",""id"":""a05e55a1d1dc464da9c2856e5ce351e3""}],""name"":""2017 IEEE Aerospace Conference"",""location"":""Big Sky, MT"",""id"":""c9ce77f2e6da48f1b392fc97b9bcd454"",""startDate"":""2017-03-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20160012382,""title"":""Practical Applications of Cables and Ropes in the ISS Countermeasures System ""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160008095
20120001508,ABSTRACT,Monitoring of Microbial Loads During Long Duration Missions as a Risk Reduction Tool,"[""Roman, Monsi C.""]","Humans have been exploring space for more than 40 years. For all those years microorganisms have accompanied, first un-manned spacecraft/cargo and later manned vessels. Microorganisms are everywhere on Earth, could easily adapt to new environments and/or can rapidly mutate to survive in very harsh conditions. Their presence in spacecraft and cargo have caused a few inconveniences over the years of humans spaceflight, ranging from crew health, life support systems challenges and material degradation. The sterilization of spacecraft that will host humans in long duration mission would be a costly operation that will not provide a long-term solution to the microbial colonization of the vessels. As soon as a human is exposed to the spacecraft, during the mission, microorganisms will start to populate the new environment. As the hum an presence in space increases in length, the risk from the microbial load, to hardware and crew will also increase. Mitigation of this risk includes several different strategies that will include minimizing the microbial load (in numbers and diversity) and monitoring. This presentation will provide a list of the risk mitigation strategies that should be implemented during ground processing, and during the mission. It will also discuss the areas that should be discussed before an effective in-flight microbial monitoring regimen is implemented. Microbial monitoring technologies will also be presented.","[{""submissionId"":20120001508,""id"":""9a2b1609e1b34092bbdf0d64b498f938"",""publicationDate"":""2011-10-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20120001508,""name"":""International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety"",""location"":""Noordwijk, Netherlands"",""id"":""590b40ae674549b6b380a4e8133eb184""},{""country"":""France"",""submissionId"":20120001508,""endDate"":""2011-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety"",""location"":""Noordwijk, Netherlands""}},""meetingId"":""7ceeb722d0d84b289b89832de16a7e1d"",""id"":""527c6522f1974466b09bdcb750b8c0fe""}],""name"":""5th IAASS Conference: A Safer Space for a Safer World"",""location"":""Paris"",""id"":""7ceeb722d0d84b289b89832de16a7e1d"",""startDate"":""2011-10-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120001508

This suggests de-regulation of cardiovascular signalling pathways indicated by upregulation of PIGf. In the current study, we measured PIGf in the plasma of 33 patients with and without coronary artery disease (CAD) to investigate whether such disease is associated with increased levels of PIGf. A control consisting of 31 sex matched apparently healthy subjects was also included in the study. We observed that the levels of PIGf in CAD patients were significantly increased compared to those in healthy control subjects (p less than 0.001) and usually increased beyond the clinical threshold level (greater than 27ng/L). The mechanisms leading to up-regulation of angiogenic factors and the adaptation of organisms to stressful environments such as isolation, high altitude, hypoxia, ischemia, microgravity, increased radiation, etc are presently unknown and require further investigation in spaceflight and these other physiologically stressed environments.","[{""submissionId"":20100022569,""id"":""fe3fd31eb443411b8683cf2ba3389b03"",""publicationDate"":""2010-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Singapore"",""submissionId"":20100022569,""endDate"":""2010-10-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""58th International Congress of Aviation and Space Medicine"",""id"":""5a262622c5d14b8abd3bd6202fb964c2"",""startDate"":""2010-10-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100022569

bioinformatic, meta-analytical, and computer-assisted research approaches. These challenges include examining interdisciplinary space life science research across experiments and across interacting spaceflight hazards (radiation, altered gravity, confinement, hostile-closed environments, distance-duration from Earth). The approaches to confront these challenges involve mining multiple datasets simultaneously from various hierarchical organizations of biological complexity, all while concurrently evaluating how experimental design factors affect endpoints of standard assays. To enable this field, it is essential that principal investigators (PIs) submit data in a structure so it can be maximally re-used.
The purpose of the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) is to collect, curate, and make publicly available all non-human space-relevant biological data. ALSDA must also ensure data are open-access, and maximally findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). The scope of ALSDA data collected and submitted by PIs include subject and study design metadata, assay metadata parameters, raw and processed assay data, assay imagery/video, and subject-experienced mission data telemetry (radiation, temperature, humidity, acoustics, vibrations, etc.). ALSDA recently integrated into a collaborative group of Open Science projects to facilitate a suite of new tools and workflows that will improve data submission, accessibility, and reusability by implementing digital data submission agreements, and adopting the data management system originally developed by NASA GeneLab. ALSDA intends to bring current biological repository data and all future collected data into this new scientific data reuse reality.
 This new suite of tools will enable ALSDA to deploy a science curation system using scientific assay configurations for the data submission portal. It will capture essential assay parameters according to established standards in each sub-field within biology. The submission portal expedites data collection by enhancing ease of PI data submission, providing a user interface and specificity for which data is to be submitted. Data submissions can be brought into cutting-edge informatic analysis portals to enable mining of physiological, behavioral, biochemical, and imaging datasets in conjunction with ‘omics-level datasets. As ALSDA datasets are submitted, curated, and published (e.g., micro-computed tomography, histology, pulse oximetry, serum metabolites, magnetic resonance imaging, intraocular pressure, novel object recognition, etc.), the merging together of spaceflight data along this multi-hierarchical complexity of biology will enable informatics and data-intensive approaches resulting in knowledge discoveries across missions, space hazards, and biological disciplines.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220000503,""endDate"":""2022-02-10T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""51ac76dcd86749a99339996c86656aa6"",""id"":""984432507f54447c908e9c9af523d8cf""}],""name"":""2022 NASA Human Research Program Investigators Workshop"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""51ac76dcd86749a99339996c86656aa6"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/cd16f7a7-974e-441a-9378-8875e486b73b/summary"",""startDate"":""2022-02-07T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10448.9C.ID016GLS.13.03D"",""NNA14AB82C"",""80NSSC18M0060""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Documentation And Information Science"",""Computer Programming And Software"",""Space Sciences (General)"",""Space Radiation"",""Aerospace Medicine"",""Cybernetics, Artificial Intelligence And Robotics""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220000503

While most microorganisms are harmless or beneficial to the inhabitants of the vehicle, the presence of medically significant organisms appearing in this semi-closed environment could adversely affect crew health and performance. The risk of exposure of the crew to medically significant organisms during a mission is estimated using information gathered during nominal and contingency environmental monitoring. Analysis of the air and surface microbiota in the habitable compartments of the International Space Station (ISS) over the last four years indicate a high presence of Staphylococcus species reflecting the human inhabitants of the vehicle. Generally, air and surface microbial concentrations are below system design specifications, suggesting a lower risk of contact infection or biodegradation. An evaluation of sample frequency indicates a decrease in the identification of new species, suggesting a lower potential for unknown microorganisms to be identified. However, the opportunistic pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, has been identified in 3 of the last 5 air samples and 5 of the last 9 surface samples. In addition, 47% of the coagulase negative Staphylococcus species that were isolated from the crew, ISS, and its hardware were found to be methicillin resistance.

20220014975,CONFERENCE_PAPER,NASA’s Moon to Mars (M2M) Transit Habitat Refinement Point of Departure Design,"[""Andrew Choate"",""Danny Harris"",""Tiffany Nickens"",""Paul Kessler"",""Matthew Simon""]","As NASA prepares for the next human footsteps on the lunar surface, the Agency is already looking ahead to systems that will enable a sustained human presence on the lunar surface and mission to Mars, including a lunar Surface Habitat (SH) and Mars Transit Habitat (TH). This paper describes the latest NASA government reference design for the TH and how it will support NASA's Moon to Mars human exploration architecture. First, it will serve as a test and demonstration platform in lunar orbit, demonstrating capabilities required for long-duration microgravity human spaceflight as part of the lunar-Mars analog missions. Then, the TH will serve as a major Mars exploration element to support crew habitation during their transit from the Earth’s orbit to Mars and returning safely before TH’s return to a lunar orbit. This paper will cover several considerations contributing to the latest habitat design refinement, including the TH's concept of operations, system functional definition, subsystem assumptions, notional interior layouts, a detailed mass and volume breakdown, and identify future trade studies and analyses required to close identified technology/ development/architecture gaps.

In addition to a technical description of the TH, this paper describes how the current TH government reference design will achieve many of the current lunar and Mars mission goals. Additionally, there are many assumed technological advances needed to support the prescribed mission phases leading up to the crewed mission to Mars in the late 2030s. The paper will describe many of the TH systems requiring further technology development and identify architectural solutions to achieve these mass, reliability, autonomy, and crew health targets.

As a whole, the data shows the government reference TH design meeting the 26.4 metric ton launch /trans-Mars injection burn control mass limit outlined within NASA’s Moon to Mars Campaign. This is achievable near the desired timeframe with moderate strategic investments including maintainable life support systems, innovative structures configuration and materials, and system/ logistics packaging.

The resulting design detail and data contained in this paper are intended to help teams across NASA and potential commercial, academic, or international partners understand the current performance targets of the Transit Habitat and vehicle interface considerations imposed by the latest Moon to Mars mission scope.

D."",""Komiyama, T."",""Fujitaka, K.""]","Organ and tissue doses and effective dose equivalent were measured using a life-size human phantom on the ninth Shuttle-Mir Mission (STS-91, June 1998), a 9.8-day spaceflight at low-Earth orbit (about 400 km in altitude and 51.65 degrees in inclination). The doses were measured at 59 positions using a combination of thermoluminescent dosimeters of Mg(2)SiO(4):Tb (TDMS) and plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTD). In correcting the change in efficiency of the TDMS, it was assumed that reduction of efficiency is attributed predominantly to HZE particles with energy greater than 100 MeV nucleon(-1). A conservative calibration curve was chosen for determining LET from the PNTD track-formation sensitivities. The organ and tissue absorbed doses during the mission ranged from 1.7 to 2.7 mGy and varied by a factor of 1.6. The dose equivalent ranged from 3.4 to 5.2 mSv and varied by a factor of 1.5 on the basis of the dependence of Q on LET in the 1990 recommendations of the ICRP. The effective quality factor (Q(e)) varied from 1.7 to 2.4. The dose equivalents for several radiation-sensitive organs, such as the stomach, lung, gonad and breast, were not significantly different from the skin dose equivalent (H(skin)). The effective dose equivalent was evaluated as 4.1 mSv, which was about 90% of the H(skin).","[{""volume"":""154"",""submissionId"":20040112668,""issue"":""6"",""issn"":""0033-7587"",""id"":""1523c20eb2234c39b5ad003f63197712"",""publicationName"":""Radiation research"",""publicationDate"":""2000-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040112668

Current spaceflights consist of 5- to 6-month excursions to the International Space Station (ISS) in low-Earth orbit (LEO), and a 12-month ISS mission is currently in planning stages. However, missions to a near-Earth asteroid (NEA), a return to the moon, or even a mission to Mars will demand unprecedented medical capabilities, particularly relating to the training of the crew medical officers (CMOs). In its attempts to address the questions about medical preparation for spaceflight beyond LEO, the Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) element within NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) defines a series of gaps. These gaps are shortcomings in knowledge, training, or technology that require resolution before an exploration mission can be undertaken. The ExMC element maintains current information about measures to close these gaps while developing plans for further investigation and research. Data pertaining to the gaps and their present status are available to the general public on the NASA Human Research Wiki and the NASA Human Research Roadmap Web sites (34, 36). One such gap, Gap 3.01, identifies a lack of knowledge about the optimal training methods for in-flight medical conditions identified on the Exploration Medical Condition List (EMCL), taking into account the crew medical officer s (CMOs) clinical background (33). This broad statement encompasses several related issues with the current methods of training CMOs and the medical ground support staff, specifically flight surgeons and biomedical engineers (BMEs) located in mission control, in addition to questions pertaining to the ways in which training will need to be adapted for the medical contingencies unique to exploration missions. To determine the optimal methods of medical training for an exploration medical crew and their ground support team, the historical context of medical operations, the current CMO training methods, and potential alternative training methods were identified.","[{""submissionId"":20130013532,""id"":""36cc93c512f842e9bf150117f47cd883"",""publicationDate"":""2014-01-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20130013532

NASA's Human Research Program is focused on addressing health risks associated with long-duration missions on the International Space Station (ISS) and future exploration-class missions beyond low Earth orbit. Visual acuity changes observed after short-duration missions were largely transient, but now more than 50 percent of ISS astronauts have experienced more profound, chronic changes with objective structural findings such as optic disc edema, globe flattening and choroidal folds. These structural and functional changes are referred to as the visual impairment and intracranial pressure (VIIP) syndrome. Development of VIIP symptoms may be related to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to spaceflight-induced cephalad fluid shifts, but this hypothesis has not been tested. The purpose of this study is to characterize fluid distribution and compartmentalization associated with long-duration spaceflight and to determine if a relation exists with vision changes and other elements of the VIIP syndrome. We also seek to determine whether the magnitude of fluid shifts during spaceflight, as well as any VIIP-related effects of those shifts, are predicted by the crewmember's pre-flight status and responses to acute hemodynamic manipulations, specifically posture changes and lower body negative pressure. Methods. We will examine a variety of physiologic variables in 10 long-duration ISS crewmembers using the test conditions and timeline presented in the figure below. Measures include: (1) fluid compartmentalization (total body water by D2O, extracellular fluid by NaBr, intracellular fluid by calculation, plasma volume by CO rebreathe, interstitial fluid by calculation); (2) forehead/eyelids, tibia, and calcaneus tissue thickness (by ultrasound); (3) vascular dimensions by ultrasound (jugular veins, cerebral and carotid arteries, vertebral arteries and veins, portal vein); (4) vascular dynamics by MRI (head/neck blood flow, cerebrospinal fluid pulsatility); (5) ocular measures (optical coherence tomography; intraocular pressure; 2-dimensional ultrasound including optic nerve sheath diameter, globe flattening, and retina-choroid thickness; Doppler ultrasound of ophthalmic and retinal arteries and veins); (6) cardiac variables by ultrasound (inferior vena cava, tricuspid flow and tissue Doppler, pulmonic valve, stroke volume, right heart dimensions and function, four-chamber views); and (7) ICP measures (tympanic membrane displacement, otoacoustic emissions). Pre- and post-flight, acute head-down tilt will induce cephalad fluid shifts, whereas lower body negative pressure will oppose these shifts. Controlled Mueller maneuvers will manipulate cardiovascular variables. Through interventions applied before, during, and after flight, we intend to fully evaluate the relationship between fluid shifts and the VIIP syndrome. Discussion. Ten subjects have consented to participate in this experiment, including the recent One-Year Mission crewmembers, who have recently completed R plus180 testing; all other subjects have completed pre-flight testing. Preliminary results from the One-Year Mission crewmembers will be presented, including measures of ocular structure and function, vascular dimensions, fluid distribution, and non-invasive estimates of intracranial pressure.","[{""submissionId"":20160013633,""id"":""22df915f6deb4195b114a842724fb9e0"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160013633,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""e34b8aecbc24496080e09182aa45f1e1""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160013633,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""1262244d056948d3aa26857ab52ec0f0"",""id"":""30e9995559274ec7a90b9f6ea1028122""}],""name"":""2017 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2017)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""1262244d056948d3aa26857ab52ec0f0"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160013633
20220014371,CONFERENCE_PAPER,"Food Acceptability, Menu Fatigue, and Aversion During the Sirius-21 Analog Mission","[""Grace L. Douglas"",""Thomas Oswald"",""Suzanne T. Bell"",""Millennia Young""]","Spaceflight food systems are closed systems, meaning they are restricted to the variety and quantity of food launched within resource limitations of the mission. The acceptability of the food system has been linked to caloric intake and associated nutritional benefits. ISS crew members receive substantial personal food preferences (around 25% of their total intake) but have noted in debriefs that they would prefer more food variety and preference for the length of the missions and they tire of certain foods over six months. Limits on variety and personal preference are expected to increase as missions become further from Earth. It is possible that menu fatigue leads to decreases in acceptability and increased aversion to available foods that may contribute to the body mass loss often experienced by spaceflight crews. However, the impact of repeat food consumption on acceptability has not yet been systematically investigated across potential spaceflight food systems. Limited variety and crew preferences within food categories may have more severe physical and behavioral health and performance consequences as mission duration increases. Characterizing the relationship between food acceptability and mission duration will contribute to defining requirements for an acceptable food system that will support crew health and performance on long duration missions.

This study evaluated acceptability of the food system used in the SIRIUS-21 8-month mission in Moscow, Russia. To capture in situ scoring of repeat consumption experiences, we administered a weekly food acceptability questionnaire to all 5 crewmembers throughout the mission. Crewmembers scored foods they consumed at 3 meals every 6 days on a 9-point hedonic scale and provided open-ended feedback regarding food context, attributes, and the meal. The sequence was intended to capture all days in the 7-day menu cycle. The repetition was intended to target repeat food ratings that may provide insight into onset of menu fatigue where they might stop eating some foods or limit their choices to their favorites. Every 30 days crewmembers completed two additional surveys to characterize the food system, any changes to the food system, and their experience with the food system.

Data collection is complete. Data are currently being assessed by descriptive statistics and visualizations of the ratings over time. The primary goal is to look for trends in the trajectories of ratings of the food items over time – both within and between individuals – to determine if there are substantial decreases in acceptability across all foods, or within specific food categories (e.g., vegetables). The number of times a particular item is scored provides some information on the frequency of consumption (preference), and the overall number of unique items can give a measure of overall variety. We will assess whether individuals were more likely to have more observations on food items that are rated higher, and whether those who rated foods higher had more or less overall variety. Since the data are composed of longitudinal subjective ratings, repeated measures techniques will be used to quantify trends over time and how these may relate to preference and variety. We will assess how these trends relate to their characterization of and experience with the SIRIUS-21 food system. We will also provide content analysis of any additional feedback collected on the open-ended questions and debrief interviews.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220014371,""endDate"":""2023-02-09T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""441414f1be6e4ab297dbda2534b9130a"",""id"":""b2561336e79e4eda935d71accdfdf297""}],""name"":""Human Research Program (HRP) Investigator’s Workshop (IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX "",""id"":""441414f1be6e4ab297dbda2534b9130a"",""startDate"":""2023-02-07T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""012556.01.04.10""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220014371
20180002539,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Development of a Ground Test and Analysis Protocol for NASA's NextSTEP Phase 2 Habitation Concepts,"[""Gernhardt, Michael L."",""Beaton, Kara H."",""Chappell, Steven P."",""Bekdash, Omar S."",""Abercromby, Andrew F. J.""]","The NASA Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program is a public-private partnership model that seeks commercial development of deep space exploration capabilities to support human spaceflight missions around and beyond cislunar space. NASA first issued the Phase 1 NextSTEP Broad Agency Announcement to U.S. industries in 2014, which called for innovative cislunar habitation concepts that leveraged commercialization plans for low-Earth orbit. These habitats will be part of the Deep Space Gateway (DSG), the cislunar space station planned by NASA for construction in the 2020s. In 2016, Phase 2 of the NextSTEP program selected five commercial partners to develop ground prototypes. A team of NASA research engineers and subject matter experts (SMEs) have been tasked with developing the ground-test protocol that will serve as the primary means by which these Phase 2 prototypes will be evaluated. Since 2008, this core test team has successfully conducted multiple spaceflight analog mission evaluations utilizing a consistent set of operational tools, methods, and metrics to enable the iterative development, testing, analysis, and validation of evolving exploration architectures, operations concepts, and vehicle designs. The purpose of implementing a similar evaluation process for the Phase 2 Habitation Concepts is to consistently evaluate different commercial partner ground prototypes to provide data-driven, actionable recommendations for Phase 3. This paper describes the process by which the ground test protocol was developed and the objectives, methods, and metrics by which the NextSTEP Phase 2 Habitation Concepts will be rigorously and systematically evaluated. The protocol has been developed using both a top-down and bottom-up approach. Top-down development began with the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) exploration objectives and ISS Exploration Capability Study Team (IECST) candidate flight objectives. Strategic questions and associated rationales, derived from these candidate architectural objectives, provide the framework by which the ground-test protocol will address the DSG stack elements and configurations, systems and subsystems, and habitation, science, and EVA functions. From these strategic questions, high-level functional requirements for the DSG were drafted and associated ground-test objectives and analysis protocols were established. Bottom-up development incorporated objectives from NASA SMEs in autonomy, avionics and software, communication, environmental control and life support systems, exercise, extravehicular activity, exploration medical operations, guidance navigation and control, human factors and behavioral performance, human factors and habitability, logistics, Mission Control Center operations, power, radiation, robotics, safety and mission assurance, science, simulation, structures, thermal, trash management, and vehicle health. Top-down and bottom-up objectives were integrated to form overall functional requirements - ground-test objectives and analysis mapping. From this mapping, ground-test objectives were organized into those that will be evaluated through inspection, demonstration, analysis, subsystem standalone testing, and human-in-the-loop (HITL) testing. For the HITL tests, mission-like timelines, procedures, and flight rules have been developed to directly meet ground test objectives and evaluate specific functional requirements. Data collected from these assessments will be analyzed to determine the acceptability of habitation element configurations and the combinations of capabilities that will result in the best habitation platform to be recommended by the test team for Phase 3.","[{""submissionId"":20180002539,""id"":""0fea602bd145433d99b8e9673416a3f5"",""publicationDate"":""2018-03-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20180002539,""name"":""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"",""location"":""New York, NY, United States"",""id"":""2e74da8e94eb4873a21ae140abab54b9""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180002539,""endDate"":""2018-03-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"",""location"":""New York, NY, United States""}},""meetingId"":""57825c153e3d4f54866d40db0b3e0e68"",""id"":""317e9d1cb97944639c49b31f39ce40ac""}],""name"":""IEEE Aerospace Conference 2018"",""location"":""Big Sky, MT"",""id"":""57825c153e3d4f54866d40db0b3e0e68"",""startDate"":""2018-03-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Lunar And Planetary Science And Exploration""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180002539

Calculated loss rates in trabecular (Trb) volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), in astronauts after return from 6-month long-duration (LD) spaceflight, are rapid relative to menopause-induced loss rates and could contribute to the observed lack of recovery.  Perforations in the Trb bony struts, skeletal fragility and fractures [5] have been associated with the rapid rate of bone loss in women due to menopause. The more rapid loss rate observed in astronauts could be inducing similar, irreversible losses of trabecular connectivity as seen in cadaver studies of female skeletons. These changes are not detectable by DXA technology and would not be discovered in astronauts during scheduled, triennial DXA testing for primary osteoporosis. High-resolution-peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) of the lower leg have detected losses in Trb vBMD (vBMD) and changes in Trb microarchitecture (µArch) in astronauts immediately following routine 6-month spaceflights and continuing in some individuals for 1 or more years postflight with no signs of recovery. Resolution of these microarchitectural changes by whole body QCT, especially in the deeply embedded hip bone, is prohibitive due to excessive and unsafe radiation exposures. While HR-pQCT has sufficient resolution to study Trb µArch at safe and lower radiation exposure testing is restricted only to the lower leg and wrist. Hence, a technology to detect detrimental changes to Trb µArch in astronauts, especially of the hip, is needed to inform type and timing of countermeasures to irreversible deficits (preflight, inflight and postflight).

<b>METHODS</b>. This HRP-funded study (2023-2027) will verify the sensitivity of a protocol for MRI scanning (on a 3T Siemens Vida) to detect changes to hip Trb µArch in persons following spinal cord injury (SCI); skeletal immobilization below the spinal lesion will serve as an analog for non-weight-bearing during spaceflight. The study period has been extended by 1 yr due to delayed Richmond IRB approval in Y1. A 3T MRI protocol will characterize serial changes in hip Trb µArch in SCI patients from time of admission at the Richmond VA Medical Center to their scheduled annual exam 12-months later.  SCI patients with age, sex, and physical characteristics like ISS astronauts will be consented. The ability of 3T MRI hip scan to discriminate loss of trabecular connectivity subjects with SCI will be compared to age- and sex-matched ambulatory controls. A comparison between HR-pQCT and MRI measurements at the ankle (distal tibia) of study subjects will also be performed. A modified DXA scan analysis (3D-Shaper) will also be verified as a potential method for monitoring concurrent changes in hip Trb bone over 12-month.

20040088442,REPRINT,Space radiation dosimetry in low-Earth orbit and beyond,"[""Benton, E. R."",""Benton, E. V.""]","Space radiation dosimetry presents one of the greatest challenges in the discipline of radiation protection. This is a result of both the highly complex nature of the radiation fields encountered in low-Earth orbit (LEO) and interplanetary space and of the constraints imposed by spaceflight on instrument design. This paper reviews the sources and composition of the space radiation environment in LEO as well as beyond the Earth's magnetosphere. A review of much of the dosimetric data that have been gathered over the last four decades of human space flight is presented. The different factors affecting the radiation exposures of astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are emphasized. Measurements made aboard the Mir Orbital Station have highlighted the importance of both secondary particle production within the structure of spacecraft and the effect of shielding on both crew dose and dose equivalent. Roughly half the dose on ISS is expected to come from trapped protons and half from galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). The dearth of neutron measurements aboard LEO spacecraft and the difficulty inherent in making such measurements have led to large uncertainties in estimates of the neutron contribution to total dose equivalent. Except for a limited number of measurements made aboard the Apollo lunar missions, no crew dosimetry has been conducted beyond the Earth's magnetosphere. At the present time we are forced to rely on model-based estimates of crew dose and dose equivalent when planning for interplanetary missions, such as a mission to Mars. While space crews in LEO are unlikely to exceed the exposure limits recommended by such groups as the NCRP, dose equivalents of the same order as the recommended limits are likely over the course of a human mission to Mars. c2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

20240011576,ABSTRACT,Next Generation Exercise Device (NGED): Advancing Exercise Capabilities for Future Space Missions Through Biomechanical Modeling,"[""C Wang"",""K H Lostroscio"",""C A Bell"",""L Quinto"",""C Beck"",""E Benia"",""L J Quiocho"",""L B Nilsson""]","BACKGROUND
As space exploration extends to long-duration missions on the Moon and Mars, maintaining astronaut health and fitness becomes increasingly critical. The Next Generation Exercise Device (NGED), developed and tested by the HumanWorks Lab in NASA Johnson Space Center's (JSC) Software, Robotics, and Simulation Division, aims to address this challenge through innovative approaches. This study presents the development and evaluation of an NGED system, focusing on its adaptability to various mission scenarios, including prospective use in a Lunar Pressurized Rover (LPR). Central to this project is the application of biomechanical modeling to optimize exercise efficacy and safety in microgravity and partial gravity environments. The project is a collaborative effort with the Human Health and Performance group at Johnson Space Center, ensuring a comprehensive approach to astronaut well-being that integrates biomechanical principles with practical exercise solutions. The NGED represents the next generation of exercise capabilities for missions in space, on the Moon and Mars, with a specific focus on applications such as the LPR.

METHODS AND RESULTS
Data collection for NGED development was conducted with two motor-driven Beyond Power Voltra I [1] systems and a custom test structure to allow placement of the cable-based devices on the ground, at shoulder height, and overhead. The collection was performed in JSC’s Prototype Immersive Technology (PIT) Lab, utilizing an OptiTrack motion capture system and AMTI force platform, to enable detailed biomechanical analysis via OpenSim [2,3]. Motion capture data were collected for three subjects representing different body types and statures. The marker set used was an enhanced version of the full-body Plug-in Gait marker set [4], with additional markers strategically placed for the primary objective of informing exercise volume requirements. Subjects performed a series of 17 exercises, carefully selected to engage various muscle groups, including novel spaceflight exercises such as skiing (ergometer style), lateral pulldowns, wood chops, triceps extensions, and flies, with load variations ranging from 10 to 90 pounds to maintain kinematic form. This comprehensive approach allowed for a thorough evaluation of the NGED's performance across a wide range of motions and loads. The biomechanical modeling and analysis were conducted using a modified OpenSim Full Body Rajagopal Model [4,5] and also scaled to the maximum and minimum anthropometry provided in NASA-STD-3001 [6]. Volumetric convex hulls were generated based on model marker trajectories and aggregated into geometric assemblies. These can be placed in models of vehicle designs to assess fit to protect for exercise as well as to adapt NGED exercise to fit available space. Preliminary findings from the collection indicate that the NGED prototype demonstrates significant adaptability across varying user anthropometrics and exercise types. The device showed consistent performance in load-bearing exercises, with subjects able to perform exercises effectively while maintaining proper biomechanical form. 

CONCLUSION 
NGED represents a forward-looking advancement in exercise capabilities for future space missions. In the future, this system can be used to capture valuable metrics (e.g., isometric mid-thigh pull for force output measurements, assessments of postural muscle strength, overall isometric strength). Its versatility in accommodating various exercises and user physiques, coupled with the ability to provide targeted biomechanical loading, makes it a promising approach for maintaining astronaut health during long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. Future work will focus on refining the NGED based on initial biomechanical findings, leveraging the detailed insights provided by motion capture and analysis techniques. Particular emphasis will be placed on optimizing its use within the confined spaces of a LPR and other space habitats. This work contributes significantly to NASA's goals of supporting human health and performance in deep space exploration, paving the way for sustainable long-term presence beyond Low Earth Orbit through advanced, biomechanically-informed exercise solutions.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240011576,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d2089035c6dc4a3aa1b34eb04ef2e957"",""id"":""694759c5e8f24b878d767412e28e7b64""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators' Workshop (HRP-IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""d2089035c6dc4a3aa1b34eb04ef2e957"",""url"":""https://www.nasa.gov/hrp-iws-2025/"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""80JSC023DA010"",""80JSC020D0060""]",undefined,"[""Engineering (General)"",""Cybernetics, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics""]","[{""id"":20250000239,""title"":""Next Generation Exercise Device (NGED): Advancing Exercise Capabilities for Future Space Missions Through Biomechanical Modeling""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240011576
20250000555,PRESENTATION,Assessing the Influence of Decompression Sickness on Medical Risk for Artemis,"[""Clara Gasiewski"",""Lauren McIntyre"",""Drayton Munster"",""Jerry Myers""]","As NASA begins to shift its focus from LEO missions to the Moon and beyond, our understanding of the risk associated with human spaceflight is challenged by mission profiles and objectives far different from preceding missions. For Artemis, one of these aspects is surface   Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) tempo, in which the crew will perform 3 to 4 surface EVA’s in quick succession. The crew health and performance risk associated with EVA Decompression Sickness (DCS) and its associated countermeasures, is an important consideration for Artemis missions given this new and unprecedented EVA frequency. Successfully completing Artemis mission objectives relies heavily on the crew being able to perform and complete these EVAs. This analysis quantifies how medical risk changes when accounting for the expected increase in DCS risk due to the increase in EVA frequency. 

If there is an occurrence of DCS during a mission, appropriate downtime needs to be accounted for. Treatment for DCS requires crewmember to stop the current EVA and return to the habitat. This impacts the current EVA the crew is performing, could potentially delay the next EVA, and increases the chance of the crewmember being unable to perform future EVAs. Capturing the downtime and impact of that downtime based on the number of DCS occurrences allows us to better understand how the risk associated with DCS affects the overall medical risk and completion of missions that have more frequent EVA tempo.

There are preventative strategies and mitigation countermeasures to decrease the chance of DCS occurring such as different prebreathe protocols, variable suit pressure, and vehicle pressure settings. Modeling the medical risk with and without different DCS countermeasures enables quantitative comparisons of risk reduction associated with each DCS countermeasure. We present results on how these countermeasures affect medical risks and quantify changes in the medical kit contents with respect to the countermeasures implemented within Artemis-class missions.

20220009591,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Investigating Molecular Responses to Space Radiation for Biological Missions Beyond Low Earth Orbit,"[""Lauren Courtney Liddell"",""Sergio Renan Santa Maria"",""Diana Marron Gentry""]","As we plan crewed missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond, it is essential to understand how persistent exposure to deep space radiation affects biology. Unlike on the International Space Station (ISS), where crew support and sample return are possible, experiments for long-duration missions require autonomous systems with no sample return.

Human cells would be ideal biosensors, but limitations in culture methods, extended prelaunch storage, and long flight durations make it difficult to keep human cells alive. Unlike other model systems, yeast can survive the constraints of long-duration spaceflight. Despite a billion years of evolution separating yeast from humans, we share homology in hundreds of genes important for basic cell function, including responses to DNA damage. Thus, yeast are excellent biosensors for detecting types/extent of damage induced by space radiation.

BioSentinel is NASA’s latest biological CubeSat, and first interplanetary space bioscience mission. BioSentinel is launching on Artemis 1, the first flight of NASA’s Space Launch System, in 2022. The BioSensor payload within BioSentinel contains two yeast strains. The wild type serves as a control for health and normal DNA damage repair (DDR). The rad51 deletion mutant is defective for DDR and will undergo alterations to growth and metabolism as it accumulates radiation damage. Changes in growth and metabolic activity will be measured using a 3-color LED detection system and the metabolic redox dye alamarBlue®.

Preliminary tests indicate a significant change in alamarBlue responses to space-like, low-dose ionizing radiation. We will discuss these findings in five parts – Introduction to NASA’s biological CubeSats and BioSentinel (presented by Sergio Santa Maria), analysis of flight data from the ISS mission (presented by Kylie Akiyama), preliminary molecular responses to space radiation (presented here), a deeper dive into those pathways (presented by Kyra Keenan), and characterizing stress response through redox potential data (presented by Diana Gentry).",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220009591,""endDate"":""2022-11-12T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""40e292dade5754e3979554f9c3646d0e"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Leidos (United States)"",""location"":""Reston, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""e64969819f6f4105a76083849ebecb3e"",""id"":""d5f91002f33546f2bc97ca1bfe7bed56""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research Annual Conference"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""e64969819f6f4105a76083849ebecb3e"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2022-meeting/"",""startDate"":""2022-11-09T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""SRS BioSentinel 10448.9C.ID036SRS.01.810""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220009591
20240011658,ABSTRACT,Summary of Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) Designed to Enable Earth Independent Medical Operations (EIMO),"[""Jay Lemery"",""Kurt L Berens"",""Benjamin Easter"",""Kris R Lehnhardt""]","The Exploration Medical Capability Element (ExMC) in NASA’s Human Research Program hosted a series of TIMs in 2023-2024 designed to stimulate discussion around specific topics with the goal of enabling EIMO. In context of the thematic constituent elements of EIMO, namely pre-mission planning, acute/emergent/prolonged medical decision making, supply/resource management and task load management, subject matter experts from industry, academia and government (NASA and other Agencies) provided valuable and actionable guidance and recommendations. Earth-based medical experts will remain indispensable for pre-mission planning, however, management of acute/emergent medical contingencies will require a gradual transition of medical care and decision making from terrestrial to space-based assets to enable support of astronaut health and performance and reduce overall mission risk. Key to achieving these enhancements is providing an integrated data system platform capable of utilizing multiple data streams in concert with a variety of on-board databases and passive monitoring of video and wearable sensors to enable a multi-modal, agentic AI-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) to support crew medical officer (CMO) medical decision-making. The EIMO series of TIMs (I-V) have proven to be instructive and portend a significant paradigm shift will be necessary to maintain crew health and performance on exploration class missions. Importantly, since the expected paradigm shift will be significantly different from the methods of operation that have been employed for the majority of missions from the inception of human spaceflight to date, any proposed methods must be deployed in the setting of ongoing operations early and be “tested, reviewed and practiced” while reliable back-up is available to facilitate an Enterprise-wide level of comfort and acceptance. Serious constraints on data transmission coupled with a large and expanding universe of on-board medical informatics data streams will necessitate implementation of a CDSS to supplant the current reliance on support provided by ground-based SMEs. Establishment of trust in the system by CMO/crew and the ground-based medical support team will be essential. Co-development of a CDSS with industry partners will assure that state of the art tools can be employed, and industry efficiencies can be leveraged. Training regimens, materials and tools must evolve to be responsive (just-in-time training) and facilitate autonomous execution of procedures. Proficiency metrics should be established and be based on validated competencies or milestones as opposed to a prescribed number of training hours. Training should be prioritized for broad, translatable skills that have universal application across a variety of medical conditions. Repetition was deemed to be the key to achieving proficiency and emphasis should lie in procedural training which is known to extinguish more rapidly than diagnostic skills. Advanced tools, e.g., extended reality, can provide more realistic and effective training. Use of advanced probabilistic risk assessment tools will be essential to optimize the medical system capability while carefully balancing risk relative to mass/power/volume limitations. Importance of factoring use-life of medical supplies and maintaining awareness of redundancy and opportunity to re-purpose under off nominal situations was emphasized. Consideration of adopting optimized performance standards vs. “good-enough” performance thresholds is warranted. The use of legacy systems as opposed to creating new systems may be preferable. Managing task load and associated cognitive load will be essential to maintain operational safety and behavioral health.

20210021932,PRESENTATION,CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT:  PATH TO FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS,"[""M. Krihak"",""B. Russell"",""B. Burian"",""D. Beaugrand"",""J. Noel"",""M. Lyons"",""B. Schmitt"",""D. Levin"",""D. Pletcher"",""K. Martin""]","Long-duration, deep-space exploration missions present significant challenges to crew health and performance. These challenges include the individual and combined effects of microgravity, radiation exposure, isolation, limited resources (mass, volume, power, data and crew time), limited options for evacuation and those associated with delayed or constrained communications, all of which demand greater crew autonomy.  Specifically, as the communication delays intensify the further we explore space, the unqualified need for Earth-independent medical operations focused on autonomous diagnosis, treatment and prevention will be key to mission continuation and success.  To augment the requisite knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) of a time-constrained crew operating under stressful conditions, combatting fatigue, and facing a potential medical crisis, a robust clinical decision support system (CDSS) is a probable solution that would facilitate, guide and inform Earth-independent medical operations, while assisting crewmembers through various clinical presentations.  The Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element of the Human Research Program (HRP) is expanding the boundaries of space medical systems to advance the care of astronauts on future exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit.  ExMC is actively identifying and testing next-generation medical care and crew health maintenance technologies.  The Clinical Decision Support (CDS) project addresses gap Medical-701 within the Inflight Medical Conditions risk:  “Enhance medical capabilities within an exploration medical system.”  Though mass, volume, and power will face increasing constraints, the projected computational capabilities of spacecraft systems will increase exponentially as information technology continues to advance this decade and beyond.  Hence, data, software and computational resources will play an essential and synergistic role in maintaining crew health, wellness and performance in deep space missions.

The focus of the CDS project is to develop recommended requirements for an in-vehicle CDSS that acts as a ‘virtual assistant’ for delivering optimal health, performance and medical care during exploration missions.  The CDSS is envisioned as an integrated, software-based tool deployed on a laptop computer or handheld device. The CDSS will assist the crew and ground support when interacting with knowledge/databases (e.g. records, pharmacy, schedule), instrumentation (e.g. imaging, physiological monitoring devices), and habitat (e.g. wellness system, task performance system) and vehicle systems (e.g. environmental system, communication system).  In addition, the human interface will employ a context-based approach that accounts for the crew’s situation.  Thus, extraneous and clinically/operationally non-relevant information are reduced to avoid an increase in cognitive load.  The framework of an ideal spaceflight CDSS is to include core and advanced analytical features that incorporate work from collaborators yet maintain a flexible platform for integrating new technology in the future.  

In fiscal year 2021 (FY21), the CDS project identified requirements through two primary mechanisms: (i) the development of software implementation prototypes and (ii) the application of systems engineering processes.  The CDS project developed and tested a series of increasingly complex system prototypes that were based on use cases derived from the CDSS concept of operations (ConOps).  These software implementations yielded insights on CDSS functionality as well as lessons learned that provided the initial requirements for CDSS capability.  By applying a systems engineering (SE) approach, medical scenarios provided in the ConOps and the use cases for software implementation underwent functional decomposition to identify CDSS functionality.  Also, systems-based modeling language (SysML) tools such as activity diagrams were developed from the same ConOps and use cases to identify CDSS functionality.  The lessons learned from software implementation defined both specific requirements and broad areas of requirements.  Within these defined broad requirement areas, further analysis of the SE products identified specific capability that resulted in the final functional requirements.  In summary, the software prototypes, functional decomposition of the ConOps and use cases, and SysML diagrams provided the basis for the CDSS requirements developed in FY21.  In the upcoming year, these requirements will be refined for their final ExMC baseline review in latter FY22.

20230014212,CONFERENCE_PAPER,"Development of Head-Trunk Coordination Measures for Monitoring
Postflight Sensorimotor Readaptation Strategies","[""H M Weiss"",""Sarah Catherine Moudy"",""Scott Jonathan Wood""]","During exploration missions, individual health assessments will be required to account for variability in neurosensory adaptation and task readiness for the initial extravehicular activities (EVAs). Previous research has identified postflight vestibular alterations and disruptions in head-trunk coordination after both short and long duration spaceflight missions. Astronauts were found to minimize head angular displacement and utilize a consistent forward head tilt theorized as a compensatory approach to stabilize the cephalic system and reduce motion sickness during readaptation to Earth’s gravity. Further, anecdotal self-reports from Shuttle crewmembers stated that pitch and side-to-side head movements immediately post-landing typically resulted in perceived angular self-motion. Notable disruptions also occur upon arrival in orbit, with astronauts choosing waist rotation rather than head movements during dynamic tasks.  It is thought that the underlying sensorimotor disruptions may contribute to motion sickness in space and upon landing, postflight gait dysfunction, and inaccurate spatial orientation when performing daily tasks. To better characterize microgravity-induced sensorimotor adaptations, it is important to develop measures and monitoring tools that have high sensitivity in detecting changes in head-trunk coordination.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230014212,""endDate"":""2024-02-02T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f3058223629d40cbbd0a0f442f72e5b5"",""id"":""1835b49acf4e447d80918b53430dac5c""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators' Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""f3058223629d40cbbd0a0f442f72e5b5"",""startDate"":""2024-01-30T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.03.01.33.2162""]",undefined,"[""Space Transportation and Safety""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230014212
20220014379,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Extended Duration: The SIRIUS 21 Crew Perspective,"[""S. E. Whiting"",""W. Brown"",""A. Kowalski"",""B. J. Caldwell"",""W. B. Vessey""]","The SIRIUS (Scientific International Research In a Unique terrestrial Station) missions represent a collaborative effort between NASA and Russia’s Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP) to conduct a series of long duration isolation and confinement spaceflight analog missions. Three missions of 17-day, 4-month, and 8-month duration (SIRIUS 17, 19, and 21) have been completed at IBMP’s Ground-Based Experimental Complex / Nazemnyy eksperimental'nyy kompleks (NEK) in Moscow, Russia.

The international SIRIUS 21 crew comprising representatives from the United States, United Arab Emirates and Russia recently completed the 8-month analog lunar mission. The extended duration mission included simulated lunar transit, orbital, and surface operations with corresponding deep space communication delay, during which the crew participated in nearly 70 studies, eight of which were sponsored by NASA’s Human Research Program. The studies examined the effect of isolation and confinement on the behavioral health of research subjects, and investigated medical countermeasures, team performance, crew dynamics, crew autonomy, food system risks, consequences of confinement and associated physiological stressors. SIRIUS 21 crewmembers also participated in operational tasks such as Rover and CubeSat assembly, simulated lunar sample assessment, VR activities, robotic arm training, environmental systems monitoring, exercise, greenhouse maintenance and 3D printing. Communication with Mission Control was limited to 30-minute periods every two hours. Since access to the internet and email was restricted, simulated ground support provided the Crew’s primary source of daily news and mission information. 

This panel discussion will include presentations from the US SIRIUS  21 crewmembers – William Brown and Ashley Kowalski – about their experience participating in the mission and science. A facilitated question and answer session will follow with attendees encouraged to ask questions and join in discussion with the SIRIUS 21 crewmembers about their experiences.

20170000272,ABSTRACT,Mind the Gap: Exploring the Underground of the NASA Space Cancer Risk Model,"[""Chappell, L. J."",""Elgart, S. R."",""Milder, C. M."",""Shavers, M. R."",""Semones, E. J."",""Huff, J. L.""]","The REID quantifies the lifetime risk of death from radiation-induced cancer in an exposed astronaut. The NASA Space Cancer Risk (NSCR) 2012 mode incorporates elements from physics, biology, epidemiology, and statistics to generate the REID distribution. The current model quantifies the space radiation environment, radiation quality, and dose-rate effects to estimate a NASA-weighted dose. This weighted dose is mapped to the excess risk of radiation-induced cancer mortality from acute exposures to gamma rays and then transferred to an astronaut population. Finally, the REID is determined by integrating this risk over the individual's lifetime. The calculated upper 95% confidence limit of the REID is used to restrict an astronaut's permissible mission duration (PMD) for a proposed mission. As a statistical quantity characterized by broad, subjective uncertainties, REID estimates for space missions result in wide distributions. Currently, the upper 95% confidence level is over 350% larger than the mean REID value, which can severely limit an astronaut's PMD. The model incorporates inputs from multiple scientific disciplines in the risk estimation process. Physics and particle transport models calculate how radiation moves through space, penetrates spacecraft, and makes its way to the human beings onboard. Epidemiological studies of exposures from atomic bombings, medical treatments, and power plants are used to quantify health risks from acute and chronic low linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation. Biological studies in cellular and animal models using radiation at various LETs and energies inform quality metrics for ions present in space radiation. Statistical methodologies unite these elements, controlling for mathematical and scientific uncertainty and variability. Despite current progress, these research platforms contain knowledge gaps contributing to the large uncertainties still present in the model. The NASA Space Radiation Program Element (SRPE) defines the knowledge gaps that impact our understanding of the cancer risks. These gaps are outlined in NASA's Human Research Roadmap [4], which identifies the research questions and actions recommended for reducing the uncertainty in the current NSCR model and for formulation of future models. The greatest contributors to uncertainty in the current model include radiation quality, dose rate effects, and the transfer of exposure-based risk from other populations to an astronaut population. Future formulations of the risk model may benefit from including other potential sources of uncertainty such as space dosimetry, errors in human epidemiology data, and the impact of microgravity and other spaceflight stressors. Here, we discuss the current capabilities of the NSCR-2012 model and several immediate research needs, highlighting areas expected to have an operational impact on the current model schema. The following subway-style route map outlines the NSCR-2012 model (Green Line), emphasizing the research gaps in the Human Research Roadmap for risk of radiation-induced carcinogenesis (Stops on Dashed Lines). The map diagrams how these research gaps feed specific portions of the model.","[{""submissionId"":20170000272,""id"":""cc32bce53c654c3683a0fb388c1c60c6"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20170000272,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""5c6dde2bf8d045368f8fa68effeb74ed""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170000272,""endDate"":""2017-01-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""72937b3b986c44c8808c1c75c5f9cfd6"",""id"":""67993ce5dc094eaf9fefafd4231d284e""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""72937b3b986c44c8808c1c75c5f9cfd6"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170000272
20200000639,PRESENTATION,"VEG-04: The Effects of Light Quality on Mizuna Mustard Growth, Nutritional Composition, and Organoleptic Acceptability for a Space Diet","[""Massa, Gioia D."",""Bunchek, Jess M."",""Wheeler, Raymond M."",""Douglas, Grace L."",""Hummerick, Mary P."",""Mitchell, Cary A."",""Morrow, Robert C."",""Morsi, Asmaa H."",""Roma, Peter G."",""Romeyn, Matthew W."",""Spencer, LaShelle E.""]","Growing fresh, nutritious, palatable produce for crew consumption during spaceflight may provide health-promoting, bioavailable nutrients and enhance the astronaut dietary experience as we move toward longer-duration missions. Tending plants may also serve as a countermeasure for crew psychological stresses associated with spaceflight. However, requirements to support consistent growth of a variety of high quality, nutritious crops under spaceflight environmental conditions remain unclear. This study explores the potential to grow crops for consumption on the International Space Station (ISS) using the Veggie vegetable-production system. VEG-04A and B were two flight tests conducted in 2019 with the leafy green crop mizuna mustard. Mizuna was grown in two Veggie chambers simultaneously, with the chambers set to different red-to-blue light formulations; one Veggie was programmed as ""red-rich"" and the second as ""blue-rich."" Light quality is known to impact plant growth, nutrition, microbiology, and organoleptic characteristics on Earth, and the Veggie flight tests examined how these impacts might differ in microgravity. VEG-04A, a 35-day growth test with a single harvest, was initiated in June and harvested in July 2019. At harvest, the astronauts froze half of the edible plant tissue to return to Earth and weighed the remaining half using the Mass Measurement Device (MMD). Weighed samples were then cleaned with produce-sanitizing wipes, and consenting crew members participated in organoleptic evaluation of the fresh produce. The remaining sanitized produce was available for crew consumption as desired. Frozen flight samples were returned at the end of August for microbial and chemical analyses to assess food safety and nutritional quality. No pathogens were detected on VEG-04A flight or ground control samples. On average, bacterial and fungal counts were significantly lower on ground control samples than flight samples. VEG-04B, a 56-day test with multiple harvests from the same plants, assessed sustained productivity. VEG-04B was initiated in October 2019 with three harvests at four, six, and eight weeks after initiation. Challenges with the watering program occurred early during VEG-04A, and several plants failed to survive in both the flight and ground control operations. Thus, prior to VEG-04B, an extra test was conducted to tailor water timing and volumes. This test determined that mizuna grew best if the wicks inside the plant pillow were allowed to dry after plants germinated, reducing persistent water around the stem. The wicks changed from being a conduit for water out of the plant pillow to being a conduit for air into the root zone. This test allowed a fine tuning of methods for VEG-04B. It is our hope that these tests on ISS will help mitigate the risk of an inadequate food supply for long-duration missions by adding fresh vegetables to the crew diet. This research was co-funded by the Human Research Program and Space Biology (MTL#1075) in the ILSRA 2015 NRA call.","[{""submissionId"":20200000639,""id"":""ab6c8c52958542539d1baa97bb8cb16b"",""publicationDate"":""2020-01-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20200000639,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""9fc3c99077fa4ee897b937bc64101a2c""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20200000639,""endDate"":""2020-01-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""65740fdd082c42fb834da437db48741e"",""id"":""856e116b08b34090a53f1d83d5d2d40c""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""65740fdd082c42fb834da437db48741e"",""startDate"":""2020-01-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNX15AN78G"",""80KSC017C0012"",""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20190033231,""title"":""VEG-04: the Effects of Light Quality on Mizuna Mustard Growth, Nutritional Composition, and Organoleptic Acceptability for a Space Diet""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20200000639
20050172253,REPRINT,Antibody binding in altered gravity: implications for immunosorbent assay during space flight,"[""Maule, Jake"",""Fogel, Marilyn"",""Steele, Andrew"",""Wainwright, Norman"",""Pierson, Duane L."",""McKay, David S.""]","A single antibody-incubation step of an indirect, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed during microgravity, Martian gravity (0.38 G) and hypergravity (1.8 G) phases of parabolic flight, onboard the NASA KC-135 aircraft. Antibody-antigen binding occurred within 15 seconds; the level of binding did not differ between microgravity, Martian gravity and 1 G (Earth's gravity) conditions. During hypergravity and 1 G, antibody binding was directly proportional to the fluid volume (per microtiter well) used for incubation; this pattern was not observed during microgravity. These effects in microgravity may be due to ""fluid spread"" within the chamber (observed during microgravity with digital photography), leading to greater fluid-surface contact and subsequently antibody-antigen contact. In summary, these results demonstrate that: i) ELISA antibody-incubation and washing steps can be successfully performed by human operators during microgravity, Martian gravity and hypergravity; ii) there is no significant difference in antibody binding between microgravity, Martian gravity and 1 G conditions; and iii) a smaller fluid volume/well (and therefore less antibody) was required for a given level of binding during microgravity. These conclusions indicate that reduced gravity would not present a barrier to successful operation of immunosorbent assays during spaceflight.","[{""volume"":""10"",""submissionId"":20050172253,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""1077-9248"",""id"":""ec71971cb6a344259972ca74d84e9ca9"",""publicationName"":""Journal of gravitational physiology :  a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology"",""publicationDate"":""2003-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050172253

Therefore, optimal nutrition is a necessity in normal gravity on Earth, in microgravity, and when applying artificial gravity to the human system. Reduced physical activity, such as observed in microgravity or bed rest, has an effect on many physiological systems, such as the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, immune, and body fluids regulation systems. There is currently no countermeasure that is effective to counteract both the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning when applied for a short duration (see Chapter 1). Artificial gravity therefore seems the simplest physiological approach to keep these systems intact. The application of intermittent daily dose of artificial gravity by means of centrifugation has often been proposed as a potential countermeasure against the physiological deconditioning induced by spaceflight. However, neither the optimal gravity level, nor its optimal duration of exposure have been enough studied to recommend a validated, effective, and efficient artificial gravity application. As discussed in previous chapters, artificial gravity has a very high potential to counteract any changes caused by reduced physical activity. The nutrient supply, which ideally should match the actual needs, will interact with these changes and therefore has also to be taken into account. This chapter reviews the potential interactions between these nutrients (energy intake, vitamins, minerals) and the other physiological systems affected by artificial gravity generated by an on-board short-radius centrifuge.","[{""submissionId"":20060053362,""id"":""3d4cbc08fffb4cc8b87c82efe7b366cf"",""publicationDate"":""2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20060053362

20040089930,REPRINT,Spacelab Life Sciences flight experiments:  an integrated approach to the study of cardiovascular deconditioning and orthostatic hypotension,"[""Gaffney, F. A.""]","The microgravity environment of spaceflight produces rapid cardiovascular changes which are adaptive and appropriate in that setting, but are associated with significant deconditioning and orthostatic hypotension on return to Earth's gravity.  The rapidity with which these space flight induced changes appear and disappear provides an ideal model for studying the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of deconditioning and orthostatic hypotension, regardless of etiology.  Since significant deconditioning is seen after flights of very short duration, muscle atrophy due to inactivity plays, at most, a small role.  These changes in circulatory control associated with cephalad fluid shifts, rather than inactivity per se, are probably more important factors.  In order to test this hypothesis in a systematic way, a multidisciplinary approach which defines and integrates inputs and responses from a wide variety of circulatory sub-systems is required.  The cardiovascular experiments selected for Spacelab Life Sciences flights 1 and 2 provide such an approach.  Both human and animal models will be utilized.  Pre- and post-flight characterization of the payload crew includes determination of maximal exercise capacity (bicycle ergometry), orthostatic tolerance (lower body negative pressure), alpha and beta adrenergic sensitivity (isoproterenol and phenylephrine infusions), baroreflex sensitivity (ECG-gated, stepwise changes in carotid artery transmural pressure with a pneumatic neck collar), and responses to a 24 h period of 5 deg head-down tilt.  Measurements of cardiac output (CO2 and C2H2 rebreathing), cardiac chamber dimensions (phased-array 2-dimensional echocardiography), direct central venous pressure, leg volume (Thornton sock), limb blood flow and venous compliance (occlusion plethysmography), blood and plasma volumes, renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates, and various hormonal levels including catecholamines and atrial natriuretic factor will also be obtained.  The central venous catheter will be inserted immediately pre-launch and monitored with heart rate and blood pressure in-flight until cardiac output, respiratory gas exchange and quantitative 2D echocardiography measurements can be performed.  In-flight hemodynamic measurements will be repeated at rest and during submaximal exercise daily and also during maximal exercise midway through the flight to document the timecourse and extent of cardiovascular changes in the payload crew.  Parallel studies are planned for the animals.  In addition to measurements of right atrial and aortic pressures and cardiac output, a dorsal micro-circulatory chamber will allow determinations of changes in capillary and venular architecture and function in six of the rats.  The techniques and findings from many of the SLS-1 and 2 supporting studies have already yielded significant information about circulatory regulation in patients with both hypo- and hypertension.  The flight experiments themselves will provide new data to test the validity of both animal and human models currently used for simulating the fluid shifts of a micro-gravity environment.  The development of effective countermeasures, not only for short and long duration space travellers, but also for Earth-bound medical patients can then be physiologically based on experimental data rather than anecdote.","[{""volume"":""15"",""submissionId"":20040089930,""issue"":""5"",""issn"":""0094-5765"",""id"":""31e011def19d462a82385c11b99ab6d0"",""publicationName"":""Acta astronautica"",""publicationDate"":""1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089930

Multiple spaceflight stressors can elicit adverse health outcomes including exposure to space radiation. Space radiation exposure has been identified by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as an important contributor to cancer, degenerative tissue diseases including cataracts, cardiovascular disease, immune system dysfunction and possible central nervous system decrements. The complexity of the human central nervous system makes it difficult to adequately recapitulate in experimental model systems, which hinders quantitative description of associated decrements. The brain aging hallmarks, as introduced by Mattson and Arumugam in 2018, are measurable cellular and molecular hallmarks that generally contribute to the aging process, describe an aging phenotype, and are part of the etiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. These hallmarks include mitochondrial dysfunction, accumulation of oxidatively damaged molecules (oxidative stress), impaired lysosome and proteasome function, dysregulation of neuronal calcium homeostasis, compromised adaptive cellular stress response, aberrant neuronal network activity, impaired deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair, inflammation, impaired neurogenesis and dysregulated energy metabolism. Cellular senescence and telomere attrition may also be considered, though more evidence is needed to regard them as brain-specific hallmarks of aging. Radiation exposure has previously been correlated with aging etiology; therefore, investigating the effects of radiation exposure within the context of the hallmarks of brain aging may provide insights into potential health risks facing NASA astronauts, and may provide a means to identify disease processes that may be important targets for disease prevention or intervention. This work describes the hallmarks of brain aging and serves as a primer for future investigation into how the hallmarks of brain aging may compare and contrast with outcomes associated with exposure to the space radiation environment. Further, it will be useful in future identification of hallmarks that may be appropriate to target for radiation countermeasures specific to the central nervous system.","[{""submissionId"":20220014274,""id"":""ced3d73e7d4842579a12887823888c9b"",""publicationDate"":""2022-09-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNX13AJ46A"",""651549.02.07.01"",""NNJ15HK11B"",""80LARC17C0004""]",undefined,"[""Space Radiation""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220014274
20210022755,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Hazards of Lunar Surface Exploration: Determining the Immunogenicity/Allergenicity of Lunar Dust,"[""Brian Crucian"",""Stephanie Krieger"",""Mayra Nelman-Gonzalez"",""Gailen Marshall""]","There are multiple Apollo program reports of lunar dust (LD) exposure leading to significant upper respiratory symptoms in select crewmembers. Possible mechanisms include particulate irritation, oxidization and release of noxious gas, or legitimate adaptive immune-mediated response. Although sterile non-protein matter would not be expected to be an allergen, one Apollo flight surgeon reported increasing symptoms upon repeated exposure, with associated eosinophilia indicative of allergy (*Acta Astronautica. 2008 63 (7–10): 980–987). Many ISS crews display a pattern of persistent immune system dysregulation and latent virus reactivation (NPJ Microgravity. 2015 Sep 3; 1:15013; NPJ Microgravity. 2017 Apr 12; 3:11). Some ISS crews manifest atypical respiratory and/or dermatitis symptoms which could have an allergic pathogenesis (J Allergy Clin. Immunol. Pract. 2016 Jul-Aug; 4(4):759-762.e8). It is logical to anticipate crew immune dysregulation would worsen during prolonged deep space missions. Planetary surface hazards will only complicate crew health risks.
This study hypothesizes that LD exposure can alter susceptible individuals’ immune responses such that repeated exposure will elicit an IgE mediated allergic response either to the LD itself or concomitant antigen exposure during spaceflight. This will adversely increase clinical and operational impacts for long-duration lunar astronauts and affect countermeasure requirements for surface vehicles. Specific aims for this study are (1) Does in vitro LD exposure result in increased histamine from human peripheral blood basophils? (2) Can LD impact the capacity of CD4+ helper and/or CD19+ B-cell mediated IgE production?
To address these questions, a set of in-vitro cell culture experiments will be employed (short and long term) using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and basophils from both atopic and non-atopic individuals, as well as established human basophil and mast cell lines. Cells will be co-cultured with cellular mitogens, common recall antigens (tetanus, Der p1), nickel (as a possible allergenic component of LD), with or without graded amounts of LD, to study whether LD exposure for varying time intervals will alter the generation of selective immune responses associated with clinical allergic reactions. Measured outputs include supernatant-derived IgE, tryptase, histamine and selected cytokine levels. Cellular activation will be monitored by assessing activation markers via flow cytometry. EM/x-ray analysis will be used to determine cellular interactions with dust particles. The minimal amount of LD (Apollo 14 dust) and controls/simulants have been requested.

20040089969,REPRINT,The effects of gravity on the circadian timing system,"[""Fuller, C. A.""]","The physiological system responsible for the temporal coordination of an organism is the circadian timing system (CTS).  This system provides two forms of temporal coordination.  First, the CTS provides for synchronization of the organism with the 24 hour period of the external environment.  This synchronization of the organism with the environment is termed entrainment.  Second, this system also provides for internal coordination of the various physiological, behavioral, and biochemical events within the organism.  When either of these two temporal relationships are disturbed, various dysfunctions can be manifest within the organism.  Homeostatic capacity of other physiological systems may be reduced.  Performance is decreased and sleep disorders, mental health impairment (e.g., depression), jet lag syndrome, and shift work maladaptation frequently occur.  Over the last several years, several studies have evaluated the potential influence of gravity on this physiological control system by examining changes in rhythmic characteristics of organisms exposed to altered gravitational environments.  The altered gravitational environments have included the microgravity of spaceflight as well as hyperdynamic fields produced via centrifugation.","[{""volume"":""1"",""submissionId"":20040089969,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""1077-9248"",""id"":""7902fd5e3fc94051a6cfd13296a8c9bd"",""publicationName"":""Journal of gravitational physiology :  a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1994-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG2-567"",""NAG2-587"",""NAG2-840""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089969

Previous long-term studies using the spaceflight analog of strict 6° HDBR for 30 days revealed changes  in  ocular  structure,  including  optic  disc  edema.    The effects  of  an  AG countermeasure  using  intermittent  centrifugation  to  restore  upright  hydrostatic  gradients  and  reduce  the  ocular  and  brain  anatomical effects has not been explored. METHODS The effects of 60-day exposure to simulated microgravity (6° HDBR) on  the  cerebral,  ocular  and  vestibular  systems  with  and  without  the  intervention of daily   30   minute   exposure   to   AG   (short-arm centrifugation) was evaluated  in  24  healthy  subjects.    Non-invasive measurements of cerebral blood flow, intracranial blood volume (near infrared spectroscopy, NIRS), cerebral and ocular structure (MRI and optical coherence tomography), internal jugular vein area (ultrasound), lateral    ventricular    volumes (MRI),    intraocular    pressure,    and    sensorimotor/vestibular (i.e.  balance  and  coordination)  systems  were made during various time-points during the bedrest study. Additional measures with ultrasound and NIRS were made during centrifugation. RESULTS The study began in Spring 2019 and all 24 subjects completed the testing by end of 2019.  Data analysis continues.  We report the following updated results for 2021.  MRI showed significant decreases in carotid artery  flow,  increases  in  brain  and  CSF  volumes,  and  aqueductal  flow  velocities  in  all  subjects  in  HDT  compared to baseline supine, but no effects of the short duration AG.  All groups showed increased posterior globe flattening during bedrest compared to baseline, without protection from AG.  As previously reported we observed chorioretinal folds for the first time in a bedrest analog, as well as optic disc edema, with no protection  from  the  short-term  AG.    Data  from  the  study  is  now  being  transmitted  to  the  NASA  LSDA  which will allow for future research. CONCLUSIONS The 6 degree HDBR analog produced significant changes in the anatomical and physiological functions of the brain and eye in healthy subjects.  Daily 30 minute exposure to AG with short-arm centrifugation had significant transient effects on physiology of the cerebrovascular system, but was not sufficient to prevent the anatomical effects of HDBR on the brain and eye.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20210026073,""endDate"":""2022-02-10T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""440ac51bc7934d74b30122ef71a2b85b"",""id"":""a43e705c3c054748b27be936899fc5e7""}],""name"":""2022 Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS 2022)"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""440ac51bc7934d74b30122ef71a2b85b"",""startDate"":""2022-02-07T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNX16AE78G""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210026073

A."",""Kofman, I."",""Bloomberg, J. J."",""Mulavara, A. P."",""Seidler, R. D.""]","Long duration spaceflight affects posture control, locomotion, and manual control. The microgravity environment is an important causal factor for spaceflight induced sensorimotor changes through direct effects on peripheral changes that result from reduced vestibular stimulation and body unloading. Effects of microgravity on sensorimotor function have been investigated on earth using bed rest studies. Long duration bed rest serves as a space-flight analogue because it mimics microgravity in body unloading and bodily fluid shifts. It has been hypothesized that the cephalad fluid shift that has been observed in microgravity could potentially affect central nervous system function and structure, and thereby indirectly affect sensorimotor or cognitive functioning. Preliminary results of one of our ongoing studies indeed showed that 70 days of long duration head down-tilt bed rest results in focal changes in gray matter volume from pre-bed rest to various time points during bed rest. These gray matter changes that could reflect fluid shifts as well as neuroplasticity were related to decrements in motor skills such as maintenance of equilibrium. In consideration of the health and performance of crewmembers both inand post-flight we are currently conducting a study that investigates the potential preventive effects of exercise on gray matter and motor performance changes that we observed over the course of bed rest. Numerous studies have shown beneficial effects of aerobic exercise on brain structure and cognitive performance in healthy and demented subjects over a large age range. We therefore hypothesized that an exercise intervention in bed rest could potentially mitigate or prevent the effects of bed rest on the central nervous system. Here we present preliminary outcomes of our study.","[{""submissionId"":20140014051,""id"":""ff6fede2ec2d45c3856f25850fd94555"",""publicationDate"":""2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140014051,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""a250f9de725c472d87ad2e0fd94e1840""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140014051,""endDate"":""2015-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""8ccaff322ecb48d2811364bf91d9f59d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""938c40e74aee437eaa2b24666f3882ce"",""id"":""0e98b01b5ba544a196ba44fabce63361""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""938c40e74aee437eaa2b24666f3882ce"",""id"":""7fa2d0a278ef4cda99238e3997550683""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2015)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""938c40e74aee437eaa2b24666f3882ce"",""startDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140014051

We sought to understand the impact of microgravity alone on the cellular mechanisms critical to immunity. We utilized clinostatic RWV bioreactors that simulate aspects of microgravity to analyze the response of human PBMC to polyclonal activation. PHA responsiveness in the RWV was almost completely diminished. IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion was reduced whereas IL- 1 beta and IL-6 secretion was increased, suggesting that monocytes may not be as adversely affected by simulated microgravity as T cells. Activation marker expression (CD25, CD69, CD71) was significantly reduced in RWV cultures. Furthermore, addition of exogenous IL-2 to these cultures did not restore proliferation. Reduced cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions may play a role in the loss of PHA responsiveness. However, PHA activation in Teflon culture bags that limit cell-substratum interactions did not suppress PHA activation. Furthermore, increasing cell density and, therefore, cell-cell interactions in the RWV cultures did not help restore PHA activation. However, placing PBMC within small collagen beads did partially restore PHA responsiveness. Activation of both PBMC and purified T cells with PMA and ionomycin was unaffected by RWV culture, indicating that signaling mechanisms downstream of PKC activation and calcium flux are not sensitive to simulated microgravity. Furthermore, submitogenic doses of PMA alone but not ionomycin alone restored PHA responsiveness of PBMC in RWV culture. Thus, our data indicate that during polyclonal activation the signaling pathways upstream of PKC activation are sensitive to simulated microgravity.","[{""submissionId"":19970026874,""id"":""e80c3c81c85c44498871c8add564df14"",""publicationDate"":""1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19970026874

This paper describes the latest NASA government reference design for the TH and how it will support NASA's Moon to Mars human exploration architecture. First, it will serve as a test and demonstration platform in lunar orbit, demonstrating capabilities required for long-duration microgravity human spaceflight as part of the lunar-Mars analog missions. Then, the TH will also serve as a major Mars habitation exploration element to support the crew during their transit from the lunar orbit to Mars and returning them safely to lunar orbit. This paper will cover several considerations contributing to the latest habitat design refinement, including data on the TH's concept of operations, system functional definition, subsystem assumptions, notional interior layouts, a detailed mass and volume breakdown, and trade studies and analyses required to close identified technology/ development/architecture gaps. 

In addition to a technical description of the TH, this paper describes how the current TH government reference design will achieve many of the current lunar and Mars mission goals. Additionally, there are many assumed technological advances needed to support the prescribed mission phases leading up to the crewed mission to Mars in the late 2030s. The paper will describe many of the TH systems requiring further technology development and identify architectural solutions to achieve these mass, reliability, autonomy, and crew health targets.

As a whole, the data in the paper shows that a TH meeting the 43 metric tons launch mass/trans-Mars injection burn limits specified by the Evolvable Mars Campaign is achievable near the desired timeframe with moderate strategic investments including maintainable life support systems, re-purposable structures and packaging, and lightweight exercise modalities. It also identifies operational and technological options to reduce this mass to less than 41 metric tons, including staging of launch structure/packaging and alternate structural materials.

In combination with flight research, ground-based analogs that simulate key mission conditions like the social and physical isolation associated with distance from Earth are essential research platforms for characterizing risk and developing validated and feasible countermeasures that support future crews and ground support teams. With several isolation and confinement analogs currently operating, and even more in development, there is great opportunity for a collaborative global analog environment to complement and optimize research efforts.
The Research Operations and Integration team will moderate a panel discussion among analog operators and scientists who utilize isolation and confinement analogs. The focus of discussion will be the potential for strategic coordination, portability, and harmonization of science across different platforms; and identifying the valuable similarities and differences among isolation analogs as well as existing gaps within the analog community.
A Q&A session will follow with attendees encouraged to ask questions and join in the discussion.

20170009936,ABSTRACT,Extension of Space Food Shelf Life Through Hurdle Approach,"[""Cooper, M. R."",""Sirmons, T. A."",""Froio-Blumsack, D."",""Mohr, L."",""Young, M."",""Douglas, G. L.""]","The processed and prepackaged space food system is the main source of crew nutrition, and hence central to astronaut health and performance. Unfortunately, space food quality and nutrition degrade to unacceptable levels in two to three years with current food stabilization technologies. Future exploration missions will require a food system that remains safe, acceptable and nutritious through five years of storage within vehicle resource constraints. The potential of stabilization technologies (alternative storage temperatures, processing, formulation, ingredient source, packaging, and preparation procedures), when combined in hurdle approach, to mitigate quality and nutritional degradation is being assessed. Sixteen representative foods from the International Space Station food system were chosen for production and analysis and will be evaluated initially and at one, three, and five years with potential for analysis at seven years if necessary. Analysis includes changes in color, texture, nutrition, sensory quality, and rehydration ratio when applicable. The food samples will be stored at -20 C, 4 C, and 21 C. Select food samples will also be evaluated at -80 C to determine the impacts of ultra-cold storage after one and five years. Packaging film barrier properties and mechanical integrity will be assessed before and after processing and storage. At the study conclusion, if tested hurdles are adequate, formulation, processing, and storage combinations will be uniquely identified for processed food matrices to achieve a five-year shelf life. This study will provide one of the most comprehensive investigations of long duration food stability ever completed, and the achievement of extended food system stability will have profound impacts to health and performance for spaceflight crews and for relief efforts and military applications on Earth.","[{""submissionId"":20170009936,""id"":""3f3e2dda85d542b0951befd69e553d93"",""publicationDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170009936,""endDate"":""2018-01-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""95f851ee50024a61a6ca7803e477ce09"",""id"":""6a5f0ec34a1e4e8aa546b7e2152542b6""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2018)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""95f851ee50024a61a6ca7803e477ce09"",""startDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170009936
20230014207,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Manual Crew Override of Vehicle Landings Following G-Transitions,"[""Austin M Bollinger"",""Kevin R Duda"",""Douglas H Wheelock"",""Steven T Moore"",""Scott J Wood""]","BACKGROUND
Manual control during exploration spaceflight consists of both planned automated supervisory control and unplanned crew override. This crew override capability is critical to enable overall mission success during landing contingencies. However, the introduction of manual override capabilities must be implemented to enable crews to mitigate risks introduced by human error. Adaptive changes in the sensorimotor system can manifest during g-transitions as spatial disorientation. While training and landing aids enable successful landing through disorientation, these adaptive changes may increase cognitive demand that needs to be accounted for in the manual control strategy. It is important to characterize these effects as soon as possible following the G-transition to develop appropriate countermeasures.

METHODS
In this study, we will examine operational piloting tasks following International Space Station (ISS) missions in a simulated lunar landing using a six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) motion base. The motion-based simulation will be implemented in our laboratory at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) and will be available within hours following the return from commercial crew landings. The primary goals of this study are (1) to understand the impact of spaceflight on crew ability to perform manual crew override tasks, (2) to examine how adaptive changes in vestibular and cognitive function relate to changes in manual crew override proficiency, and (3) compare performance during late “just-in-time” on-board training with early post-flight crew performance. The impact of spaceflight on piloting capability will be assessed from pre- versus post-flight changes in crewmembers assigned to either short duration (< 30 day) or long duration (~6- month) missions to the International Space Station (ISS). Individual differences in post-flight vestibular and cognitive changes include motion sickness reports, measures of tilt motion perception accuracy and precision, and dual-task tracking. During the 6DOF lunar simulation, the crew will manually takeover attitude and rate-of-descent to the nominal or re-designated landing aim point during the approach phase. The outcome measures for the lunar crew override tasks will be the percent time maintaining actual vehicle states, e.g., attitude and rate-of-descent, within recommended guidance during the landing approach, number and maximum deviation outside limits, and root mean square error (RMSE). Given that “just-in-time” (JIT) training is an operational expectation for the Human Landing System (HLS) program, all participants will perform late inflight JIT training for each manual crew override task in which they will participate. Crew proficiency will be captured inflight during JIT training that will be implemented on a laptop with hand controllers to allow the crewmember to practice the landing task procedures like the approach implemented for JIT training with Shuttle landing and ISS telerobotic tasks.

COUNTERMEASURE UPDATES
The lunar lander simulation has been implemented onto a two-laptop display system where subjects select from alternative landing points, based upon avoiding hazards that the on-board system identifies during the landing. The subject makes inputs using a rotational hand controller (i.e., joystick) and a translational hand controller, which are processed by simulated vehicle dynamics to update the vehicle attitude and rate of descent. Subjects will utilize a combination of flight, situation, and status displays to monitor the state of the simulated vehicle. The simulation exports tilt and translation movements to a 6DOF motion base synced to visual movements and provides representative vestibular cues to the subject while performing the task inside an enclosed cabin featuring a simulated lunar out-the-window view and a heads-down lander cockpit  view.

RELEVANCE
This project will deliver an operational demonstration of crew override capability following spaceflight and identify potential deficits that may require remediation. Comparison of individual vestibular and cognitive changes with crew override performance will help better characterize the manual control risks associated with sensorimotor alterations. The inclusion of “just-in-time” on-board training will ensure we are characterizing changes in override proficiency with this expected countermeasure in place.

Astronauts experience postflight disturbances in postural and locomotor control due to sensorimotor adaptations during spaceflight. These alterations may have adverse consequences if a rapid egress is required after landing. Although exercise is partially effective for mitigating cardiovascular and muscular deconditioning, additional countermeasures are needed to further preserve sensorimotor function. Proprioception training and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) are two promising in-flight countermeasures. Since prolonged head down tilt bed rest (HDTBR) is a spaceflight analog for body unloading and causes postural and locomotor control decrements that parallel those observed after spaceflight, it can be used to facilitate the development of these countermeasures.

<b>METHODS</b>
This study will determine the effects of proprioception training and EMS on functional task performance and sensorimotor function following 60 days of 6° HDTBR. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) an EMS arm, 2) a proprioception training arm, 3) an exercise plus proprioceptive training arm, and 4) a control arm. The EMS countermeasure will include daily bilateral stimulation of selected bilateral lower extremity muscles (30 minutes per session). Proprioception training will be performed three days per week (25 minutes per session) consisting of body-loaded postural tasks in the horizontal position on an air bearing sled. Exercise training will mimic current protocols used on the International Space Station, but treadmill aerobic exercise will be replaced with additional cycling aerobic exercise. Primary outcome measures will include pre- and post- HDTBR functional tests that require high demand for dynamic control of postural stability. Secondary measures will be used to explore key physiological changes that underlie countermeasure benefits. All HDTBR and data collection activities will be completed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) at the :envihab facility. Given the constrained samples size, a Bayesian modelling approach will be used to quantify the probability that there is an effect of a given magnitude.

<b>HARDWARE AND PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT</b>
Final hardware modifications and protocol developments were completed in preparation for Campaign 1, which began in September 2024. These included shipment, setup, and operator training for the transportable gravity bed, horizontal squat device, foam obstacle course, EMS devices, leg dexterity system, foot sole skin sensitivity system, and Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) ultrasound device. In addition, specialized protocols were developed for data collection using DLR’s equipment, including muscle morphology magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical coherence tomography, venous blood flow MRI and ultrasound, muscle ultrasound and impedance, and skin blood flow ultrasound. We will present early data from the first campaign, which concluded in November, 2024. These will be compared with previous data from the recent 30-day HDTBR campaigns (Spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome countermeasures (SANS-CM)) conducted at DLR.

<b>RELEVANCE</b>
The deliverable from this project will be proof-of-concept sensorimotor countermeasure designs for functional task performance with full assessment of efficacy in a spaceflight analog. If one or more countermeasures are effective, they will be translated for validation with the suite of operationally implemented in-flight countermeasures.","[{""submissionId"":20240012134,""publisher"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""id"":""a9bba4c3221a4e4eb350e9c52251b21d"",""publicationDate"":""2025-01-28T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240012134,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""83a40b96e8bf470eacafd6536bebdbfd"",""id"":""8b195510884f474aac45b35a90519c8c""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""83a40b96e8bf470eacafd6536bebdbfd"",""url"":"""",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.03.07.93.1605"",""NNJ15HK11B"",""80NSSC19K0567"",""80NSSC18M0060""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240012134
20040088732,ACCEPTED_MANUSCRIPT,The risk of renal stone formation during and after long duration space flight,"[""Peggy A Whitson"",""Robert A Pietrzyk,"",""Boris V. Morukov"",""Clarence F. Sams""]","BACKGROUND: The formation of a renal stone during space flight may have serious negative effects on the health of the crewmember and the success of the mission. Urinary biochemical factors and the influence of dietary factors associated with renal stone development were assessed during long duration Mir Space Station missions. 

METHODS: Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected prior to, during and following long duration space flight. The relative urinary supersaturation of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate (brushite), sodium urate, struvite and uric acid were determined. 

RESULTS: Changes in the urinary biochemistry of crewmembers during long duration spaceflight demonstrated increases in the supersaturation of the stone-forming salts. In-flight hypercalciuria was evident in a number of individual crewmembers and 24-hour dietary fluid intake and urine volume were significantly lower. During flight, there was a significant increase in brushite supersaturation. 

CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest acute effects of space flight and postflight changes in the urinary biochemistry favoring increased crystallization in the urine. The effects of dietary intake, especially fluid intake, may have a significant impact on the potential for renal stone formation. Efforts are now underway to assess the efficacy of a countermeasure to mitigate the increased risk.","[{""volume"":""89"",""submissionId"":20040088732,""issue"":""3"",""issn"":""0028-2766"",""publisher"":""Karger Publishers"",""eissn"":""2235-3186"",""id"":""1b2c55f08fe64f46bb2b99208a7991dc"",""publicationName"":""Nephron"",""publicationDate"":""2001-10-10T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""issuePublicationDate"":""2001-11-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""doi"":""10.1159/000046083""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NASA  111-30-10-11""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088732
20210021582,PRESENTATION,Investigating Biological Responses to Space-like Radiation using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ,"[""Lauren Courtney Liddell"",""Sergio Renan Santa Maria"",""Diana Marron Gentry""]","As we plan crewed missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond, it is essential to understand how persistent exposure to space radiation affects biology. Unlike on the International Space Station, where crew support and sample return are possible, experiments for long-duration missions require autonomous systems with no sample return.

Human cells would be ideal biosensors, but limitations in culture methods, extended prelaunch storage, and long flight durations make it very difficult to keep human cells alive. Unlike other model systems, yeast can survive the constraints of long-duration spaceflight. Despite a billion years of evolution separating yeast from humans, we share homology in hundreds of genes important for basic cell function, including responses to DNA damage. Thus, yeast are excellent biosensors for detecting types/extent of damage induced by space radiation.

BioSentinel is NASA’s latest biological CubeSat, and first interplanetary space bioscience mission. BioSentinel is manifested on Artemis 1, the first test flight of NASA’s Space Launch System, in the coming year. The BioSensor payload within BioSentinel contains two yeast strains. The wild type serves as a control for health and “normal” DNA damage repair (DDR). The rad51 deletion mutant is defective for DDR and will undergo alterations to growth and metabolism as it accumulates radiation damage. Changes in growth and metabolic activity will be measured using a 3-color LED detection system and the metabolic redox dye alamarBlue®.

Preliminary tests indicate a significant change in alamarBlue response to space-like, low-dose ionizing radiation. We will discuss these findings in four parts – Introduction to biological CubeSats and the BioSentinel mission (presented by Sergio Santa Maria), preliminary responses to space-like ionizing radiation (presented here), a deeper dive into tracking metabolic changes after exposure to ionizing radiation (presented by Diana Gentry), and a look into methods for correcting flight optical data (presented by Abbey Kim).

20220015741,PRESENTATION,Medical Lessons Learned from the Exploration Atmospheres Study,"[""R Sanders"",""K Ray"",""J Law"",""D Reyes""]","Background: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Exploration Atmospheres study (EA) was done to evaluate alternative cabin atmospheres for future spacecraft designs and planetary surface exploration of the Moon, Mars and beyond. Deep space exploration involves creating habitats and environments safe for human occupancy and means to explore the outside environment (extravehicular activities, EVA). In order to validate alternative atmospheres and pre-spacewalk procedures, the EA study was conducted to evaluate factors such as hypoxia risks, denitrogenation protocols, food limitations, medications, and the impact of other factors on human performance. 

Overview: Space travel is constrained by mass, volume, power and the cost of vehicle development, which creates tradeoffs in various capabilities, including breathing gasses. Higher atmospheric pressure in a vehicle means more gas, and a stronger containment vessel/habitat; while lower pressure requires higher oxygen partial pressure, which may increase fire risk. NASA’s EA study evaluated a proposed alternative cabin environment (8.2 psia, 34% Oxygen), for future spacecraft habitat, and planetary EVAs.  EA included both a 3-day and a 11-day trial. These trials included a depressurization and saturation to 8.2psi at 34% O2 with additional depresses to 4.3 psia at 85% O2 for simulated EVAs, (1 EVA during the 3-day and 5 during the 11-day trials).

Discussion:  Planning for and executing the medical monitoring and response plan for a trial of this scope was a huge undertaking with no prior practice to fall back on.  Food obstacles, sleeping issues, medications, joint injury, equipment limitations, medical privacy, multiple cases of decompression sickness, and even a COVID outbreak among the support team proved challenging.  

Conclusion:  Testing of this nature is an essential part NASA’s preparation for the upcoming Lunar Artemis missions. As spaceflight transitions beyond low earth orbit, to planetary, even more trials of this nature will be required to learn what are the optimal atmospheric and associated operational constraints to maintain the optimal health of the crew and achieve mission objectives.

Lopez"",""Samrawit G. Gebre"",""Ahleah Rohr Daniel"",""Sylvain V. Costes""]","The next era in human space exploration is rapidly approaching and will require the use of countermeasures to deep space health hazards. The development of countermeasures (or, the re-purposing of existing agents) will be highly dependent on our understanding of basic biological responses to space stressors (e.g. ionizing radiation, altered gravitational fields, altered day-night cycles, confinement, isolation, hostile-closed environments, distance-duration from Earth, exposure to celestial regolith, etc.). The fast-growing array of space biological data, which in the past was simply archived after minimal analysis, holds great potential if it can be reorganized and formatted for Open Science. Organizing the data for such analysis is a challenge because of its diverse nature (molecular, cellular, tissue, imaging, whole organism and behavior).  We will discuss here several strategies that NASA’s Biological and Physical Science Division has put in place to maximize the return on investment for spaceflight bioscience data. 

Open Science, as a scientific philosophy, is the concept that the more people who have access to the data, the more knowledge will be gained from it. This guiding principle led NASA to develop GeneLab in 2015. GeneLab houses spaceflight and relevant ground-based multi-omics data, and has grown to ~400 transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and epigenomic datasets from plant, rodent, small animal, and microbial space experiments. GeneLab provides users with various tools for data analysis and a visualization portal that allows users to interact with gene expression data from space-related ‘omics experiments. Open Science is also about building scientific communities, and with this spirit in mind, GeneLab has spawned several Analysis Working Groups (AWGs), comprised of more than 200 volunteer scientists. The AWGs initially provided feedback on the processing pipeline and metadata ‘omics standards for GeneLab. Over the last few years, they have become a community-driven science enterprise, engaging in large meta-analysis of GeneLab datasets, resulting in 10 publications (beyond the originally submitted research). Overall, the Open Science nature of  GeneLab has resulted in a high degree of data re-use, resulting in 38 additional publications derived from the original 67 publication over the past four years.

The enormous success and knowledge gained from GeneLab has led to a collection of sister NASA “Open Science Data Repositories (OSDR)” and research support groups. These include the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA), the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC), and the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). All are adopting the GeneLab data architecture system to maximize open-access, find-ability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR). ALSDA collects and curates phenotypic-physiological bioimaging-behavioral data from space and space-relevant non-human experiments, oftentimes coming from the same omics-associated experimental datasets found in GeneLab. Since 2021, a community of ~100 researchers have rallied around ALSDA, to provide feedback in a new ALSDA AWG focused on phenotypic-physiological investigation-sample-assay metadata standards (e.g., Micro-Computed Tomography, Light/Fluorescence Microscopy, Western Blot, Flow Cytometry, Novel Object Recognition, Elevated Plus Maze, etc. of ~50 assays collected). These standards are part of a new single point-of-entry data submission portal for all non-human Space Biology and Human Research Program principal investigators, to submit, curate, and share their research data. 

With open-access space biological data now collected and curated together with rich metadata, and with the potential for linkage to “big data” from the international biological and medical communities (NIH, EBI, etc.), the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) era has started for Space Biology.

These include the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA), the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC), and the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). All are adopting the GeneLab data architecture system to maximize open-access, find-ability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR). ALSDA collects and curates phenotypic-physiological bioimaging-behavioral data from space and space-relevant non-human experiments, oftentimes coming from the same omics-associated experimental datasets found in GeneLab. Since 2021, a community of ~100 researchers have rallied around ALSDA, to provide feedback in a new ALSDA AWG focused on phenotypic-physiological investigation-sample-assay metadata standards (e.g., Micro-Computed Tomography, Light/Flourescence Microscopy, Western Blot, Flow Cytometry, Novel Object Recognition, Elevated Plus Maze, etc. of ~50 assays collected). These standards are part of a new single point-of-entry data submission portal for all non-human Space Biology and Human Research Program principal investigators, to submit, curate, and share their research data.

With open-access space biological data now collected and curated together with rich metadata, and with the potential for linkage to ""big data"" from the international biological and medical communities (NIH, EBI, etc.), the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) era has started for Space Biology.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220006002,""endDate"":""2022-07-28T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""8f0b2d06f40f562aa1db2c42c5c2f80d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Astronautical Society"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""560bc28131d242c08581ae7b26c890f8"",""id"":""67fa4226003b494fab795cf55c3ed993""},{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""560bc28131d242c08581ae7b26c890f8"",""id"":""7d653328f4464084aae38a644b42607a""}],""name"":""International Space Station Research and Development Conference (ISSRDC)"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""560bc28131d242c08581ae7b26c890f8"",""url"":"""",""startDate"":""2022-07-25T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.06.01.02.06 ""]",undefined,"[""Space Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220006002
20240012131,ABSTRACT,Supervisory Control with Dual Tasking in Post G-Transition Vehicle Landings  ,"[""Matthew McDonnell"",""Hannah M. Weiss"",""James Gentile"",""Katie Tooher"",""Tanner Hunt"",""Mark Herring"",""Scott J. Wood""]","<b>BACKGROUND</b>
Landing during exploration spaceflight may consist of both planned automated supervisory control and unplanned crew override. Supervisory control, particularly when performed under cognitive load with additional monitoring tasks, is essential for ensuring overall mission success during landing contingencies. Evaluating performance in a relevant Human Landing System (HLS) supervisory landing task after long-duration microgravity exposure can help identify potential risks from human error and sensorimotor alterations. Adaptive changes in the sensorimotor system can manifest during g-transitions as spatial disorientation. Although training and landing aids facilitate successful landings despite disorientation, these adaptive changes may heighten cognitive demand, which must be considered in the landing strategy. It is important to characterize these effects as soon as possible following the G-transition while the sensorimotor system remains in a state of adaptive flux to inform appropriate countermeasures.

<b>METHODS</b>
A Multi-attribute Lunar Table Battery (MALTB) task was developed for an iOS tablet device to provide flexible 
crew testing and training capabilities in-flight and on the ground. Elements of the tablet task were derived from the Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB, Cegarra et al. 2020). The task requires crew members to study a map of a planned landing site and memorizing the terrain and surface landmarks to inform potential divert maneuvers during landing. The user will oversee a series of approaches through touchdown simulations on the tablet with an external camera view of the Lunar surface. The primary responsibility of the crew member will be to execute a divert if the guidance recommended site is erroneous (e.g., the guidance projected landing target is not within 10m of the planned landing site center), or the projected landing site is no longer suitable due to surface obstacles. Considering vehicle maneuverability and fuel reserves, the divert capabilities will diminish as the task progresses. In cases where a divert is initiated, a new landing target will need to be designated by the user and will be evaluated for the proximity to the original pre-planned site. A secondary operational monitoring task will challenge the user's cognitive reserve by requiring the user to maintain several gauges within acceptable limits and respond to a visual indicator while completing the landing approach. Outcome measures include distance from the planned landing site to the user-initiate divert landing location, ground slope at the new landing site, time to divert, the ability to accomplish the secondary monitoring tasks, and perceived workload. The tablet task is being evaluated in a ground-based study to determine the learning effect of first-time users. The tablet task will be utilized in a flight study to test performance multiple times postflight. Future potential testing in-flight have been identified for capsules with iOS tablet devices.

<b>Multi-attribute Lunar Table Battery Task</b>
MALTB comprises video footage of thirty distinct landing conditions. The landing scenarios feature various landing sites (n = 3), hazardous object sizes (n = 6), sun azimuth degrees (n = 4), camera modes (i.e., fixed or gimbaled), and navigation bias (i.e., true or false). Each seventy second trial uses a sixty-degree constant glideslope trajectory. The application architecture and layout include user identification setup and data storing, a guided walkthrough of the task and interface components, practice mode for task familiarization, and a modified Bedford workload scale administered following task completion. The time-based dependent measures are saved locally to the iOS Files application and post-processing scripts have been developed to evaluate the remaining measures of performance. 

<b>RELEVANCE</b>
This project will deliver an operational demonstration of crew monitoring capability following spaceflight and 
identify potential deficits that may require remediation. Comparison of individual vestibular and cognitive changes with crew performance will help better characterize the landing risks associated with sensorimotor alterations.

If an autonomous oculometric diagnostic-support system proves to be a reliable predictor of impending impairment of visual function in the case of primary ocular pathology on Earth, then it could also be applied in the future to the surveillance of crew to detect the potential progression of sensorimotor and neuro-ocular compromises during extended spaceflight missions, e.g., SANS, and thus guide earlier and more effective countermeasure intervention. Towards that goal, we intend to determine if a set of largely independent eye-movement metrics, called oculometrics, measured using a simple voluntary eye-tracking task that can be completed in just 5 minutes per eye, could provide clinically valid biomarkers of functional visual deficits due to primary ocular pathology. The premise is that oculometrics could be used to monitor slowly evolving ocular pathologies, potentially detecting them even before structural evidence appears in ocular imaging or other current state-of-the-art clinical measures.

20110023085,ABSTRACT,Comparison of Ocular Outcomes in Two 14-Day Bed Rest Studies,"[""Cromwell, R. L."",""Zanello, S. B."",""Yarbough, P. O."",""Taibbi, G."",""Vizzeri, G.""]","Reports of astronauts visual changes raised concern about ocular health during long-duration spaceflight. Some of these findings included hyperopic shifts, choroidal folds, optic disc edema, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickening, and cotton wool spots. While the etiology remains unknown, hypotheses speculate that hypertension in the brain caused by cephalad fluid shifts during spaceflight is a possible mechanism for these ocular changes. Head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest is a spaceflight analog that induces cephalad fluid shifts. In addition, previous studies of the HDT position demonstrated body fluid shifts associated with changes in intraocular pressure (IOP). For these reasons, vision monitoring of HDT bed rest subjects was implemented for NASA bed rest studies. Subjects selected for these studies were healthy adults (14 males and 5 females). Average age was 37.5 plus or minus 9.1 years, weight was 77.4 plus or minus 11.3 Kg, and height was 173.4 plus or minus 7.2 14 cm. Controlled conditions followed for all NASA bed rest studies were implemented. These conditions included factors such as eating a standardized diet, maintaining a strict sleep wake cycle, and remaining in bed for 24 hours each day. In one study, subjects maintained a horizontal (0 degree) position while in bed and were exercised six days per week with an integrated resistance and aerobic training (iRAT) program. In the other study, subjects were placed at 6 degrees HDT while in bed and did not engage in exercise. All subjects underwent pre- and post bed rest vision testing. While the battery of vision tests for each study was not identical, measures common to both studies will be presented. These measures included IOP and measures that provided an indication of optic disc swelling as derived from optical coherence tomography (OCT) testing: average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (millimeters), disc area (square millimeters), rim area (square millimters), and average cup to disc (C/D) ratio. For all measures, there was no significant difference between subject groups for pre-bed rest testing. Post bed rest values also remained similar between groups. Comparison of pre- to post bed rest testing within each group did not demonstrate any statistical differences. These preliminary results from 14-day bed rest studies suggest that the combination of exercise and horizontal bed rest as compared to 6 degrees HDT bed rest did not produce differences in the ocular response with regard to IOP and optic disc parameters. The ocular measures reported here only included pre- and post bed rest time points. Further investigation is needed to examine both the acute response and long term adaptation of structural and functional ocular parameters in the bed rest platform and determine its usefulness for studying spaceflight phenomena. From a clinical perspective, the ability to study ocular responses in the controlled environment of the bed rest platform can provide valuable information for the care of patients restricted to bed rest.","[{""submissionId"":20110023085,""id"":""98403255e89a4125b0a4e8b4e8cb0b92"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20110023085,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""6d360dd9040f4780bf72a773abcd8eae""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110023085,""endDate"":""2012-02-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""40e8155b5660409fb2ef3a0a33795d1c"",""id"":""2b242919b640405ca92636d705b13866""}],""name"":""2012 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""40e8155b5660409fb2ef3a0a33795d1c"",""startDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110023085

With the spaceflight missions lasting 6 months to potentially 3 years or longer this issue has assumed increased significance. Detailed measurements from the Mir and ISS long duration missions have documented losses in bone mineral density (BMD) from the total skeleton and critical sub-regions. The most important losses are from the femoral hip averaging about -1.6%/mo integral to -2.3%/mo trabecular BMD. Importantly these studies have documented the wide range in individual response from -0.5 to -5%/mo in BMD. Given the small size of any expedition crew, the wide range of responses has to be considered in the implementation of any countermeasure. Assuming that it is unlikely that the susceptibility for bone loss in any given crewmember will be known, a suite of bone loss countermeasures will likely be needed to insure protection of all crewmembers. The hypothesis for this experiment is that the combined effect of anti-resorptive drugs plus the standard in-flight exercise regimen will have a measurable effect on preventing space flight induced bone loss and strength and will reduce renal stone risk. To date, 4 crewmembers have completed the flight portion of the protocol in which crewmembers take a 70-mg alendronate tablet once a week before and during flight, starting 17 days before launch. Compared to previous ISS crewmembers (n=14) not taking alendronate, DXA measurements of the total hip BMD were significantly changed from -1.1 0.5%/mo to 0.04 0.3%/mo (p<0.01); QCT-determined trabecular BMD of the total hip was significantly changed from -2.3 1.0%/mo to -0.3 1.6%/mo (p<0.01). Significance was calculated from a one-tailed t test. While these results are encouraging, the current n (4) is small, and the large SDs indicate that while the means are improved there is still high variability in individual response.

20210022350,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Apollo Crew Loads Data Mining,"[""T Reiber"",""N Newby"",""J Somers""]","INTRODUCTION 
Human exposure data to dynamic loads in spaceflight are sparse not only because very few crewmembers have flown in space, but also because much of the historic data is no longer readily available. Earth and Moon landings of the Apollo missions are unique and valuable for understanding human tolerance in water landing conditions for both short-duration and long-duration crewmembers as well as informing crew tolerance in standing postures during planetary landings. The goal of this task was to find relevant Apollo data to better understand human tolerance in these scenarios, in order to apply this knowledge to future missions.

METHODS
The goal of this task was to recover time history data from dynamic phases of flight from crewed Apollo missions. The first phase of the task was to search available records at JSC and other centers to locate the appropriate records at the National Archives in Fort Worth, TX. Once the possible data locations were located, it was planned that one researcher would travel to the National Archives in Fort Worth, TX to collect the relevant Apollo data. 

Once the data was retrieved, they would be digitized for future use and evaluation, and archived within the Human Physiology, Performance, Protection, and Operations (H-3PO) laboratory within the Human Health and Performance Directorate. These data would be used to assess the feasibility and acceptability of current standards and vehicle design requirements for lunar and Mars missions. Additionally, any medical monitoring required, or physiological changes noted in crewmembers based on dynamic loads would be documented for future use. 

RESULTS 
Relevant records were found at Ft. Worth, TX and College Park, MD using the National Archives Online Catalog. In addition to the online catalog, an Archives staff member was able to share an additional inventory list of NASA JSC records held in Ft. Worth, TX. Due to COVID-19, NASA has only recently allowed non-mission essential travel. In addition, the National Archives has also been closed to the public since March 2020. Because of this, travel to the National Archives to search records there has not been possible. 

CONCLUSION
The findings include collections at the National Archives at both Ft. Worth, TX and College Park, MD that could possibly hold the data we are looking for. Unfortunately, the descriptions of each collection are very broad. Though we are hopeful that relevant data is stored in one of these collections, we cannot be sure that we will find what we are looking for. At this time, it is not clear when the Archives will reopen to the public or when NASA will allow travel. Travel to the Archives has been postponed, and will be reassessed at a future date.

Wheeler"",""Ani Dixit"",""Cory J. Spern"",""Millennia Young"",""Grace L. Douglas""]","Production of fresh, nutritious, and tasty produce for astronauts during spaceflight may provide health-promoting, bioavailable nutrients, enhance the dietary experience, and reduce menu fatigue as we move into longer-duration missions.  Growing and caring for plants may also reduce the psychological stresses associated with spaceflight and enhance connection to Earth.  A diversity of crops will be required to provide nutrition, variety, and resiliency, however requirements for consistent growth under spaceflight environmental conditions remain unclear.  VEG-05 is part of a series of experiments with pick-and-eat salad crops to better define best practices for crop production in space.  VEG-05 and predecessor experiments VEG-04A and VEG-04B, grew salad crops in the Veggie vegetable production facilities on the International Space Station using different lighting treatments.  In VEG-05 we grew ‘Red Robin’ dwarf cherry tomatoes under two different red: blue lighting spectra.  Light can impact the growth habit, yield, nutritional composition, microbial levels, and even flavor attributes within crops, and our goal was to assess these characteristics in ‘Red Robin’ tomatoes during VEG-05.  Considerable pre-flight verification testing was performed prior to launch in Nov. 2022.   Prior to the flight and ground experiments, lighting in both Veggie units on ISS was measured and lights were standardized between flight and ground hardware.  VEG-05 flight operations ran between December 2022 and March 2023, with a ground control initially 48 hours delayed.  Due to environmental challenges of very low humidity during the first week of the experiment, seed germination was low for both flight and ground plants.  The flight experiment ultimately had 4 - 5 plants per treatment out of the planned 6 plants, but the initial ground control had only three plants in one treatment and none in the other, so this ground control was restarted at the beginning of Feb. 2023 and ran through May, with successful growth of all 12 plants.  Both flight and ground control ran 100 days, with harvests of fruit at day 83, day 90, and day 100.  Flight plants had uneven growth, and following the early drying events, excess water was frequently observed, which led to a variety of plant stress responses including uneven plant growth, excess adventitious root formation, flower and fruit abortion, and visible microbial growth.  In total, from the five surviving red-rich lighted plants, only 5 ripe fruit were produced, and from the four surviving blue-rich lighted plants, 10 fruit were produced with only 6 of these ripe by day 100.  Because of the small fruit number and the unsatisfactory growth, crew members were not allowed to consume the tomatoes, and all fruit, as well as large branches with leaves, samples of the adventitious roots, two plant rooting pillows from each treatment, microbial sampling swabs, and some water samples were returned for analysis.  Because of the small sample sizes and factors affecting growth on the ISS, objectives of assessing light quality effect (red: blue light treatments) will not be achieved.  Revised objectives of this study include to compare stressed flight plants with normal ground plants to determine the impact of plant overwatering stress in space on food safety and the plant microbial community, to determine nutrient content changes in fruit and leaves from stressed plants, and to evaluate stress metabolism changes in returned tissue by transcriptomic analysis.  Postflight analysis is underway with the following analyses being conducted: A. culturable microbiology and food safety as well as molecular microbial community analysis of 1. ripe fruit, 2. leaves, stems, and adventitious roots, 3. pillow components (roots, wicks, and substrates), 4. swabs, and 5. water samples from root mats before and after growth.   B. transcriptomics of leaf tissue and adventitious roots, and C. elemental analysis of leaf tissue.  If sufficient tissue remains elemental analyses will also be conducted on fruit.  While not generating the desired information on spaceflight growth responses of healthy crops, our team is hopeful that these analyses will shed light on tomato responses to stress in this environment as plant overwatering stress is a mission-relevant condition that could occur in future space crop growth systems.  This research was co-funded by the Human Research Program and Space Biology (MTL#1075) in the ILSRA 2015 NRA call.

20180001902,PRESENTATION,Semi-Autonomous Rodent Habitat for Deep Space Exploration,"[""Alwood, J. S."",""Shirazi-Fard, Y."",""Pletcher, D."",""Globus, R.""]","NASA has flown animals to space as part of trailblazing missions and to understand the biological responses to spaceflight. Mice traveled in the Lunar Module with the Apollo 17 astronauts and now mice are frequent research subjects in LEO on the ISS. The ISS rodent missions have focused on unravelling biological mechanisms, better understanding risks to astronaut health, and testing candidate countermeasures. A critical barrier for longer-duration animal missions is the need for humans-in-the-loop to perform animal husbandry and perform routine tasks during a mission. Using autonomous or telerobotic systems to alleviate some of these tasks would enable longer-duration missions to be performed at the Deep Space Gateway. Rodent missions performed using the Gateway as a platform could address a number of critical risks identified by the Human Research Program (HRP), as well as Space Biology Program questions identified by NRC Decadal Survey on Biological and Physical Sciences in Space, (2011). HRP risk areas of potentially greatest relevance that the Gateway rodent missions can address include those related to visual impairment (VIIP) and radiation risks to central nervous system, cardiovascular disease, as well as countermeasure testing. Space Biology focus areas addressed by the Gateway rodent missions include mechanisms and combinatorial effects of microgravity and radiation. The objectives of the work proposed here are to 1) develop capability for semi-autonomous rodent research in cis-lunar orbit, 2) conduct key experiments for testing countermeasures against low gravity and space radiation. The hardware and operations system developed will enable experiments at least one month in duration, which potentially could be extended to one year in duration. To gain novel insights into the health risks to crew of deep space travel (i.e., exposure to space radiation), results obtained from Gateway flight rodents can be compared to ground control groups and separate groups of mice exposed to simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (at the NASA Space Radiation Lab). Results can then be compared to identical experiments conducted on the ISS. Together results from Gateway, ground-based, and ISS rodent experiments will provide novel insight into the effects of space radiation.","[{""submissionId"":20180001902,""id"":""f1aa94cbf6184150b3f8c0796888472f"",""publicationDate"":""2018-02-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180001902,""endDate"":""2018-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""eda29fd212d142529aac03c28c3442f4"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Boulder, CO, United States""}},""meetingId"":""5d16bea3f2aa4b59bf15d578c21e2bb7"",""id"":""d4866afa66f14649a6279f9fd70b00b9""}],""name"":""Deep Space Gateway Concept Science Workshop"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""5d16bea3f2aa4b59bf15d578c21e2bb7"",""startDate"":""2018-02-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180001902
20240012133,ABSTRACT,Manual Crew Override of Vehicle Landings Following G-Transitions,"[""Hannah M. Weiss"",""Austin M. Bollinger"",""Kevin R. Duda"",""Douglas H. Wheelock"",""Scott J. Wood""]","<b>BACKGROUND</b>

Manual control during exploration spaceflight consists of both planned automated supervisory control and unplanned crew override. This crew override capability is critical to enable overall mission success during landing contingencies. However, the introduction of manual override capabilities must be implemented to enable crews to mitigate risks introduced by human error. Adaptive changes in the sensorimotor system can manifest during g-transitions as spatial disorientation. While training and landing aids enable successful landing through disorientation, these adaptive changes may increase cognitive demand that needs to be accounted for in the manual control strategy. It is important to characterize these effects as soon as possible following the G-transition to develop appropriate countermeasures.

<b>METHODS</b>

The following study seeks to inform the risk associated with altered sensorimotor and vestibular function impacting critical mission tasks. We aim to characterize the effects of short and long-duration weightlessness on manual control following G-transitions using simulated lunar landing on a six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) motion base, a fixed base simulation, and a supervisory control tablet task. The primary goal is to understand the impact of spaceflight on crew ability to perform manual crew override and supervisory control. This aim will be assessed by comparing pre- versus postflight simulation performance in crewmembers assigned to either short duration (< 30 day) or long duration (~6- month) missions to the International Space Station (ISS). We hypothesize there will be postflight increases in the percent time that pilots are outside of the acceptable range for recommended vehicle state parameters and the reaction time for secondary cognitive tasks. Ground-based control subjects, who are demographically matched to the crew considering age (± 5 years) and gender, will undergo the same testing schedule as the crew to examine the effects of flight phase independent of microgravity exposure. The second aim is to examine how adaptive changes in vestibular and cognitive function relate to changes in manual crew override proficiency. Crew performance for a sensorimotor perceptual test battery will evaluate motion perception tracking, roll nulling, and/or vection sensitivity using the 6DOF motion base. We hypothesize that a higher severity of vestibular alterations will be associated with increased percent time outside of guidance limits. Motion sickness severity and sleepiness will also be evaluated. To determine the impact of “just-in-time” training, the third aim seeks to compare performance during on-board lunar landing tasks conducted late in-flight to early postflight. We hypothesize that proficiency on the “just-in-time” laptop trainer late in mission will be positively correlated with early postflight proficiency on the same task. The final aim will establish assessments of performance, training protocols, and the learning progression in a ground-control cohort of first-time users.  

<b>RESULTS</b>

The assessment of the learning progression associated with the piloting task on the motion base system with thirty ground subjects will be reported. Learning curves will be established across four distinct sessions and within session considering trial difficulty. The difficulty of the landing task can be modulated with the landing divert distance and cross or downrange difficulty. Results may include changes in performance across multiple trials of a multi-attribute lunar tablet supervisory control task. Preliminary investigations of eighteen subjects who completed vestibular threshold and motion perception tasks offer expected performance ranges for upcoming preflight crew evaluations. The results yielded an average roll threshold of 0.46 ± 0.30 deg/s and an average roll nulling root mean square error performance of 2.52 ± 0.52 deg/s. 

<b>RELEVANCE</b>

This project will deliver an operational demonstration of crew monitoring capability following spaceflight and identify potential deficits that may require remediation. Comparison of individual vestibular and cognitive changes with crew performance will help better characterize the manual control risks associated with sensorimotor alterations. Ground testing will evaluate learning progression, refine training protocols, and serve as a control cohort for comparisons to crew performance.

20250007677,CONTRACTOR_OR_GRANTEE_REPORT,"Astropharmacy Phase I, Final Report","[""Lynn J Rothschild""]","Disease is an inherent part of being alive, and thus disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment is critical to human space missions. Pharmaceuticals are used to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease, but suffer from lack of stability on Earth and even more so in the space environment. As NASA embarks on a new era in space exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit, the need to provide effective pharmaceuticals in space must be addressed. What if small quantities of pharmaceuticals could be made in space, on site, on demand? One class of drugs poses the greatest challenge: small protein (peptide) drugs.  These drugs, even with refrigeration, have the shortest shelf-life (months), and therefore require a “production-on-demand” solution for long duration missions that may last years. The protein drugs—approximately 1/3 of all new drugs that come to market today—include some of the most important spaceflight countermeasures, such as filgrastim, a growth factor that can restore the bone marrow after radiation damage, and teriparatide, a peptide drug for preventing bone demineralization.

In Phase I we introduced our production-on-demand solution, which we call “Astropharmacy”, a platform technology that involves the synthesis of drugs by a space-hardy spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, together with a novel purification system that uses histidine tags for affinity purification. We engineered B. subtilis to produce the non-glycosylated drugs filgrastim and teriparatide, which we purified with a lightweight, small volume system adapted from standard laboratory protocols and enabled by judicious genetic engineering prior to launch.","[{""submissionId"":20250007677,""id"":""9f93198398cc447ea1d95ac4006c6054"",""publicationDate"":""2021-03-01T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""371544.01.20.01.21.16""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology and Life Support"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250007677
20190002463,OTHER,Variable Vector Countermeasure Suit (V2Suit) for Space Habitation and Exploration,"[""Duda, Kevin R.""]","The ""Variable Vector Countermeasure Suit (V2Suit) for Space Habitation and Exploration"" is a visionary system concept that will revolutionize space missions by providing a platform for integrating sensors and actuators with daily astronaut intravehicular activities to improve human health and performance. The V2Suit uses control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) within a miniaturized module placed on body segments to provide a ""viscous resistance"" during movements and a countermeasure to the sensorimotor and musculoskeletal adaptation performance decrements that manifest themselves while living and working in microgravity and during gravitational transitions during long-duration spaceflight, including post-flight recovery and rehabilitation. Through an integrated design, system initialization, and control systems approach the V2Suit is capable of generating this ""viscous resistance"" along an arbitrarily specified direction of ""down."" When movements are made, for example, parallel to that ""down"" direction a resistance is applied, and when the movement is perpendicular to that direction no resistance is applied. The V2Suit proposes to be a countermeasure to this spaceflight-related adaptation and de-conditioning and the unique sensorimotor characteristics associated with living and working in 0-G, which are critical for future long-duration space missions.This NIAC Phase I project focused on detailing several aspects of the V2Suit concept, including human-system integration, system architecture, computer aided design (CAD) modeling, and closed-loop simulation and analysis. In addition, early-stage breadboard prototyping of several aspects of the V2Suit system modules enabled characterization of expected performance and identified areas for further research and development to enable operational implementation of the V2Suit. In particular, potential challenges with integration of commercial-off-the-shelf components were identified. The key enabler for operational use and adoption of the V2Suit is a low-profile body worn form factor that does not interfere with normal, everyday movements and interfaces adequately with the body as to provide the generated gyroscopic torque for the perceptions of movement with a ""viscous resistance."" These aspects were investigated through mockups using a life-size mannequin, and through body attachment mechanisms on the breadboard prototype. Through the evaluation and investigation of commercially-available components, as well as an identification of desirable form factors, CAD models of the V2Suit modules were developed. These models included all of the required elements and spin motors, flywheel masses, gimbal motors, slip rings, inertial measurement units, motor controllers, and the required mounting brackets/hardware and cabling. The configuration and orientation of the control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) was specified according to results from the modeling, simulation and analysis. Two revisions of the CAD model were investigated through closed-loop simulation of the CMGs, and their ability to generate a resultant reaction force during movement and null undesirable torques due to changes in the direction of the angular momentum vector as a result of the normal body movements.","[{""submissionId"":20190002463,""id"":""e180b792065f43d68468137a3352f007"",""publicationDate"":""2012-09-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190002463

L.""]","Treadmill locomotion exercise is an important aspect of ISS exercise countermeasures. It is widely believed that an optimized treadmill exercise protocol could offer benefits to cardiovascular and bone health. If training heart rate is high enough, treadmill exercise is expected to lead to improvements in aerobic fitness. If impact or bone loading forces are high enough, treadmill exercise may be expected to contribute to improved bone outcomes. Ground-based research suggests that joint loads increase with increased running speed. However, it is unknown if increases in locomotion speed results in similar increases in joint loads in microgravity. Although data exist regarding the biomechanics of running and walking in microgravity, a majority were collected during parabolic flight or during investigations utilizing a microgravity analog. The Second Generation Treadmill (T2) has been in use on the International Space Station (ISS) and records the ground reaction forces (GRF) produced by crewmembers during exercise. Biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in typical gait motion and allow for modeling of the human body to determine joint and muscle forces during exercise. By understanding these mechanisms, more appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies. The objective of this evaluation is to collect biomechanical data from crewmembers during treadmill exercise prior to and during flight. The goal is to determine if locomotive biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of subject load and speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise. Further, the data will be used to characterize any differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in these two gravitational conditions.

Specifically, utilization of internet based external crowdsourcing platforms to solve challenging problems in human health and performance related to the future of spaceflight. The follow-up to this success was an internal crowdsourcing pilot program entitled NASA@work, which was supported by the InnoCentive@work software platform. The objective of the NASA@work pilot was to connect the collective knowledge of individuals from all areas within the NASA organization via a private web based environment. The platform provided a venue for NASA Challenge Owners, those looking for solutions or new ideas, to pose challenges to internal solvers, those within NASA with the skill and desire to create solutions. The pilot was launched in 57 days, a record for InnoCentive and NASA, and ran for three months with a total of 20 challenges posted Agency wide. The NASA@work pilot attracted over 6,000 participants throughout NASA with a total of 183 contributing solvers for the 20 challenges posted. At the time of the pilot's closure, solvers provided viable solutions and ideas for 17 of the 20 posted challenges. The solver community provided feedback on the pilot describing it as a barrier breaking activity, conveying that there was a satisfaction associated with helping co-workers, that it was fun to think about problems outside normal work boundaries, and it was nice to learn what challenges others were facing across the agency.

A critical aspect of living in space or on planetary surfaces is habitation, which provides a safe and comfortable space in which humans can live and work. NASA is seeking out the best option for habitation by exploring several different concepts through the Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) project. The purpose of this HDU is to develop a fully autonomous habitation system that enables human exploration of space. One critical feature of the HDU project that helps to accomplish its mission of autonomy is the instrumentation system that monitors key subsystems operating within a Habitat configuration. The following paper will discuss previous instrumentation systems used in analog habitat concepts and how the current instrumentation system being implemented on the HDU1-PEM, or pressurized excursion module, is building upon the lessons learned of those previous systems. Additionally, this paper will discuss the benefits and the limitations of implementing a wireless sensor network (WSN) as the basis for data transport in the instrumentation system. Finally, this paper will address the experiences and lessons learned with integration, testing prior to deployment, and field testing at the JSC rock yard. NASA is developing the HDU1-PEM as a step towards a fully autonomous habitation system that enables human exploration of space. To accomplish this purpose, the HDU project is focusing on development, integration, testing, and evaluation of habitation systems. The HDU will be used as a technology pull, testbed, and integration environment in which to advance NASA's understanding of alternative mission architectures, requirements, and operations concepts definition and validation. This project is a multi-year effort. In 2010, the HDU1-PEM will be in a pressurized excursion module configuration, and in 2011 the module will be reconfigured for a pressurized core module configuration. Each year the HDU configurations will undergo testing at NASA's Desert Research and Technology Studies (D-RaTS) in Arizona [1]. As part of this project, a modular instrumentation system is developed to meet the monitoring needs of the HDU subsystems and to integrate with the current command and data handling infrastructure that has been developed for the project. The main objective of this study is to provide for the monitoring needs of the HDU. The requirements necessary to meet this objective are developed by working with the subsystem managers of the HDU to understand their monitoring needs. Additionally, the instrumentation system design leverages knowledge and lessons learned from previous studies, such as the inflatable habitat health monitoring system that was deployed in Antarctica [2], the integrated health monitoring system developed for NASA's Microhab [3], and the JSC Lunar Habitat Wireless Testbed to demonstrate a ""standardsbased"" approach to a wireless instrumentation system [4]. The HDU also requires flexibility in reconfiguration options, and it is necessary to demonstrate and evaluate a modular approach to an instrumentation system. Thus, the instrumentation system is designed in two parts: the primary system employs a standard WSN configuration, and the secondary system employs a wired USB hub. The WSN design provides for reconfiguration or replacement of sensors due to malfunctions or upgrades by using a wireless node that accepts ten instrument inputs and wirelessly transmits the data to the command and data handling system. The USB hub is necessary for those instruments that operate using a wired USB connection, although the design attempts to limit the amount of sensors that need to be wired connections.","[{""submissionId"":20100027353,""id"":""1d1ec79702e542e99e510472220b16e9"",""publicationDate"":""2010-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20100027353,""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""c0c4037033464ad9be0c94a8d77dd9ed""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20100027353,""endDate"":""2010-09-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""3b11365d77294b6f97ad93b492cf7416"",""id"":""e36454bef2a841198069fc985d9c4068""}],""name"":""AIAA Space 2010"",""location"":""Anaheim, CA"",""id"":""3b11365d77294b6f97ad93b492cf7416"",""startDate"":""2010-08-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 432938.09.01.05.02.01.04""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100027353

Since 2017, nanopore sequencing technology has  been  used  to  support  thein  situ identification  of  microbial  species during  spaceflight. Beginning in 2018, a culture-independent, swab-to-sequencer method was implemented onboard the ISS to provide a more thorough insight of the ISS microbiome. Eliminating microbial culture enables identification  of difficult-to-culture  organisms,  reduces  risks associated  with  potentially pathogenic cultures, and could significantly reduce the time from sample-to-answer. However, this molecular-based   approach generates large   metagenomic   datasets that   require substantial computational resources for analysis.

20210022947,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Electromagnetic Pain Relief/Blocking: Feasibility Assessment,"[""C A Mullenax""]","CONTEXT/BACKGROUND Astronauts use pharmaceuticals during spaceflight to manage acute and chronic pain, but use of analgesics will have drawbacks for exploration-class missions because the shelf life of these medications is limited, resupply will be curtailed, astronauts may develop tolerance and/or addiction to these medications, and side effects can include impairment of cognitive abilities. Electromagnetic devices have been developed that treat pain terrestrially by affecting neuromodulation–dubbed “electroceuticals”, these devices have varied mechanisms of action that either stimulate or suppress neural activity in the central nervous system or peripheral nerves. OBJECTIVE/PURPOSE The available literature was reviewed and FDA-approved pain treatments (both pharmacological and non-pharmacological), as well as those currently under development, were assessed for their suitability for use in exploration class spaceflight missions. DATA SOURCES Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting closure of libraries, data sources were restricted to those available digitally. Online database searches included PubMed, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, federal grant award databases (National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Department of Defense (DoD), National Institutes of Health (NIH)), and general internet searches. More than 1,600 records were reviewed in this effort. STUDY SELECTION/ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Targeted searches included different aspects of pain management. Priority was given to review studies, to cover as much of the available literature as possible in this limited effort. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS/DATA EXTRACTION AND DATA SYNTHESIS The titles of the studies and the awards that were obtained by searching online databases were reviewed and further information was sought for the relevant titles. Abstracts or award summaries were generally available online; for journal abstracts, full text articles were either available online or were requested via interlibrary loan. RESULTS An overwhelming majority of the literature focuses on the treatment of chronic rather than acute pain because it is assumed that acute pain only rarely fails to resolve and instead transitions into chronic pain when the central nervous system becomes hypersensitized. The available electromagnetic devices marketed for pain treatment have varying levels of invasiveness, use different mechanisms of action, and have demonstrated varying efficacy when evaluated scientifically. A truly noninvasive, highly efficient device is desired for use during spaceflight. One portable, self-contained, FDA-approved device was identified that, from preliminarily assessment, best met these criteria; the device noninvasively applies pulsed shortwave therapy (PSWT) to modify pain signals from peripheral nerves, however, the device has limited battery life and the effects are relatively non-selective in type of neural signal modified. LIMITATIONS This current effort, although extensive, did not identify a comprehensive list of all alternatives for pain treatment. Once the pandemic limitations are lifted, a longer, more thorough effort may find additional options. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS The ideal electromagnetic pain treatment device for use on exploration-class spaceflight missions does not yet exist, but it may be available soon. It is not feasible for NASA to develop medical devices due to the schedule constraints for pending exploration-class missions, but adapting a promising device that is already FDA-approved might be an option. Monitoring research that is ongoing at other federal agencies is recommended, and further review of the candidate PSWT device identified in this current effort may be warranted.

Colorado"",""Stephanie Krieger"",""Mayra Nelman-Gonzalez"",""Gailen Marshall"",""Torin Mccoy"",""Brian Crucian""]","Although infrequent, there have been Apollo program reports of lunar dust (LD) exposure leading to notable upper respiratory symptoms in select crewmembers. Possible mechanisms include particulate irritation, oxidization and release of noxious gas, or legitimate adaptive immune-mediated response. Although sterile non-protein matter would not be expected to be an allergen, one Apollo flight surgeon reported increasing symptoms upon repeated exposure with associated eosinophilia, indicative of allergy (*Acta Astronautica. 2008 63 (7–10): 980–987). Many ISS crews display a pattern of persistent immune system dysregulation and latent virus reactivation (NPJ Microgravity. 2015 Sep 3; 1:15013; NPJ Microgravity. 2017 Apr 12; 3:11). Some ISS crews manifest atypical respiratory and/or dermatitis symptoms which could have an allergic pathogenesis (J Allergy Clin. Immunol. Pract. 2016 Jul-Aug; 4(4):759-762.e8). It is logical to anticipate crew immune dysregulation would worsen during prolonged deep space missions. Planetary surface hazards will only complicate crew health risks.

This study with investigate if LD exposure will elicit an IgE mediated allergic response either to the LD itself or concomitant antigen exposure during spaceflight. Allergic reactivity could adversely increase clinical and operational impacts for long-duration lunar astronauts and affect countermeasure requirements for surface vehicles. Specific aims for this study are to answer two questions: (1) Does in vitro LD exposure result in increased histamine from human peripheral blood basophils? (2) Can LD impact the capacity of CD4+ T helper and/or CD19+ B-cell mediated IgE production?

To address these questions, after the proposal and selection by NASA, our laboratory has separately requested and been approved for receipt of actual LD samples from the Apollo 16 mission. These samples will be used during the study to complete the proposed set of in vitro cell culture experiments (short and long term), using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and basophils from both atopic and non-atopic individuals. Cells will be co-cultured with cellular mitogens, common recall antigens (Der p1), fine ground silica quartz (as a possible allergenic component of LD), or LD, to study whether LD exposure for varying time intervals will alter the generation of selective immune responses associated with clinical allergic reactions. Measured outputs include supernatant-derived IgE, tryptase, histamine, and selected cytokine levels. Cellular activation will be monitored by assessing activation markers via flow cytometry. EM/x-ray analysis will be used to determine cellular interactions with dust particles.

20090001314,ABSTRACT,Rashes and Exanthems on Long Duration Space Flights,"[""Ilscus, L.S."",""Johnston, S.L."",""Moynihan, S."",""Kerstman, E.L."",""Marshall, G.D.""]","INTRODUCTION: As NASA expands its human space exploration to the Moon, Mars and beyond, it will be presented with many challenges, not the least of which will be dealing with medical conditions, which on earth are simple, but take on new levels of complexity in space habitats. Skin conditions exemplify this complexity. METHODS AND RESULTS: While skin conditions account for 7 % of outpatient presentations to a primary care provider in the United States, NASA Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health (LSAH) database indicates that cutaneous manifestations are significantly prevalent on-orbit. Reviewing this data for US astronauts, there have been 90 total cases of skin rashes during 27.34 person-years of spaceflight, or 3.29 cases/person. Specifically, STS-1 though 114 had 56 cases, ISS Expeditions 1 though 13 had 7 cases, Mir had 4 cases, Skylab had 5 cases and the Apollo program had 18 cases. If there was a period of 24 hours or more between rashes in the same crewmember, this was counted as an additional case. DISCUSSION: This prevalence is likely due, in some part, to constraints of hygiene and to immunologic changes that occur. The stresses of microgravity and austere Earth environments such as the Antarctic, submarine and military deployments, no doubt, similarly contribute to cutaneous reactions; but the difference of the environments are significant enough to warrant further study and discussion. This paper will discuss rashes, exanthems, and cutaneous reactions in space habitats; it will address diagnosis, causation, mitigation and treatment of skin conditions seen on orbit, to date, with a look to anticipating what may be seen with larger crews on future extended duration expeditions.","[{""submissionId"":20090001314,""id"":""5ff84f278b2a492f9db6a0ca8e14e906"",""publicationDate"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20090001314,""endDate"":""2009-05-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""80th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""California"",""id"":""629bb1ce77024b519cdd56610e2fd64d"",""startDate"":""2009-05-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090001314

Specifically, utilization of internet based external crowd sourcing platforms to solve challenging problems in human health and performance related to the future of spaceflight. The follow-up to this success was an internal crowd sourcing pilot program entitled NASA@work, which was supported by the InnoCentive@work software platform. The objective of the NASA@work pilot was to connect the collective knowledge of individuals from all areas within the NASA organization via a private web based environment. The platform provided a venue for NASA Challenge Owners, those looking for solutions or new ideas, to pose challenges to internal solvers, those within NASA with the skill and desire to create solutions. The pilot was launched in 57 days, a record for InnoCentive and NASA, and ran for three months with a total of 20 challenges posted Agency wide. The NASA@work pilot attracted over 6000 participants throughout NASA with a total of 183 contributing solvers for the 20 challenges posted. At the time of the pilot?s closure, solvers provided viable solutions and ideas for 17 of the 20 posted challenges. The solver community provided feedback on the pilot describing it as a barrier breaking activity, conveying that there was a satisfaction associated with helping co-workers, that it was ""fun"" to think about problems outside normal work boundaries, and it was nice to learn what challenges others were facing across the agency. The results and the feedback from the solver community have demonstrated the power and utility of an internal collaboration tool, such as NASA@work.","[{""submissionId"":20110008247,""id"":""4565accf720d4b61ac4040ba5db2ea5b"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""South Africa"",""submissionId"":20110008247,""endDate"":""2011-10-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""62nd IAC Conference"",""location"":""Cape Town"",""id"":""24084f6b9e2f43c2a3eddaee04edb111"",""startDate"":""2011-10-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110008247
20150019431,ABSTRACT,Bringing Gravity to Space,"[""Norsk, P."",""Shelhamer, M.""]","This panel will present NASA's plans for ongoing and future research to define the requirements for Artificial Gravity (AG) as a countermeasure against the negative health effects of long-duration weightlessness. AG could mitigate the gravity-sensitive effects of spaceflight across a host of physiological systems. Bringing gravity to space could mitigate the sensorimotor and neuro-vestibular disturbances induced by G-transitions upon reaching a planetary body, and the cardiovascular deconditioning and musculoskeletal weakness induced by weightlessness. Of particular interest for AG during deep-space missions is mitigation of the Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome that the majority of astronauts exhibit in space to varying degrees, and which presumably is associated with weightlessness-induced fluid shift from lower to upper body segments. AG could be very effective for reversing the fluid shift and thus help prevent VIIP. The first presentation by Dr. Charles will summarize some of the ground-based and (very little) space-based research that has been conducted on AG by the various space programs. Dr. Paloski will address the use of AG during deep-space exploration-class missions and describe the different AG scenarios such as intra-vehicular, part-of-vehicle, or whole-vehicle centrifugations. Dr. Clement will discuss currently planned NASA research as well as how to coordinate future activities among NASA's international partners. Dr. Barr will describe some possible future plans for using space- and ground-based partial-G analogs to define the relationship between physiological responses and G levels between 0 and 1. Finally, Dr. Stenger will summarize how the human cardiovascular system could benefit from intermittent short-radius centrifugations during long-duration missions.","[{""submissionId"":20150019431,""id"":""f7e5136847b945468db322c7de5c00ae"",""publicationDate"":""2016-04-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150019431,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States"",""id"":""47a94525ea454a4e8f7734bcb1651d34""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150019431,""endDate"":""2016-04-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f6d67f0c8806455a95691849dc76bce8"",""id"":""9758f88b3d1f489cbd1a0d4ca1f19aae""}],""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association Conference (AsMA)"",""location"":""Atlantic City, NJ"",""id"":""f6d67f0c8806455a95691849dc76bce8"",""startDate"":""2016-04-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150019431

20170011470,PRESENTATION,"The Evolution of Exercise Hardware on ISS: Past, Present, and Future","[""Buxton, R. E. "",""Kalogera, K. L."",""Hanson, A. M.""]","During 16 years in low-Earth orbit, the suite of exercise hardware aboard the International Space Station (ISS) has matured significantly. Today, the countermeasure system supports an array of physical-training protocols and serves as an extensive research platform. Future hardware designs are required to have smaller operational envelopes and must also mitigate known physiologic issues observed in long-duration spaceflight. Taking lessons learned from the long history of space exercise will be important to successful development and implementation of future, compact exercise hardware. The evolution of exercise hardware as deployed on the ISS has implications for future exercise hardware and operations. Key lessons learned from the early days of ISS have helped to: 1. Enhance hardware performance (increased speed and loads). 2. Mature software interfaces. 3. Compare inflight exercise workloads to pre-, in-, and post-flight musculoskeletal and aerobic conditions. 4. Improve exercise comfort. 5. Develop complimentary hardware for research and operations. Current ISS exercise hardware includes both custom and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. Benefits and challenges to this approach have prepared engineering teams to take a hybrid approach when designing and implementing future exercise hardware. Significant effort has gone into consideration of hardware instrumentation and wearable devices that provide important data to monitor crew health and performance.","[{""submissionId"":20170011470,""id"":""ae65116625ca42edb97b9bdaec50dfab"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170011470,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""06c2e14fb49b48e5b036cd8fb8befe9d"",""id"":""586a0828e28347cdaf7a564be5841e6c""}],""name"":""Annual NASA Human Research Program Investigator''s Workshop (HRP IWS) 2017"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""06c2e14fb49b48e5b036cd8fb8befe9d"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Computer Programming And Software"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170011470
20150023015,ABSTRACT,Dried Plum Protects From Radiation-Induced Bone Loss by Attenuating Pro-Osteoclastic and Oxidative Stress Responses,"[""Globus, Ruth""]","Future space explorations beyond the earths magnetosphere will increase human exposure to space radiation and associated risks to skeletal health. We hypothesize that oxidative stress resulting from radiation exposure plays a major role in progressive bone loss and dysfunction in associated tissue. In animal studies, increased free radical formation is associated with pathological changes in bone structure, enhanced bone resorption, reduced bone formation and decreased bone mineral density, which can lead to skeletal fragility. Our long-term goals are to define the mechanisms and risk of bone loss in the spaceflight environment and to facilitate the development of effective countermeasures. We had previously reported that exposure to low or high-LET radiation correlates with an acute increase in the expression of pro-osteoclastic and oxidative stress genes in bone during the early response to radiation followed by pathological changes in skeletal structure. We then conducted systematic screening for potential countermeasures against bone loss where we tested the ability of various antioxidants to mitigate the radiation-induced increase in expression of these markers. For the screen, 16-week old C57Bl6J mice were treated with a dietary antioxidant cocktail, injectable DHLA or a dried plum-enriched diet (DP). Mice were then exposed to 2Gy 137Cs radiation and one day later, marrow cells were collected and the relevant genes analyzed for expression levels. Among the candidate countermeasures tested, DP was most effective in reducing the expression of genes associated with bone loss. Furthermore, analysis of skeletal structure by microcomputed tomography (microCT) revealed that DP also prevents the radiation-induced deterioration in skeletal microarchitecture as indicated by parameters such as percent bone volume (BVTV), trabecular spacing and trabecular number. We also found that DP has similar protective effects on skeletal structure in a follow-up study using 1 Gy of sequential proton and iron, radiation species relevant to spaceflight. When cultured ex vivo under osteogenic conditions, bone marrow-derived cells from DP-fed animals exhibited increased colony numbers compared to control diet-fed animals. These findings suggest that DP exerts pro-osteogenic effects apart from its previously demonstrated anti-resorptive action, which may be one of the mechanisms underlying its radioprotective effect on bone. In conclusion, a diet enriched in certain types of antioxidants may be useful as an intervention for radiation-induced bone loss.","[{""submissionId"":20150023015,""id"":""710a091d27ce43b392053461d5810fba"",""publicationDate"":""2015-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150023015,""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Bozeman, MT, United States"",""id"":""b6b2f03ef2a345ad89d92c87352bef15""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150023015,""endDate"":""2015-09-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Bozeman, MT, United States""}},""meetingId"":""0c8740b440f74a53b7a83f741451bb01"",""id"":""62a6bf7117f64d21b831704a061e0888""}],""name"":""Radiation Research Society Annual Meeting & SIT Workshop"",""location"":""Weston, Florida"",""id"":""0c8740b440f74a53b7a83f741451bb01"",""startDate"":""2015-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 516724.02.01.10""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Space Radiation""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150023015

J."",""Sharpe, M.""]","Future astronauts in deep space missions will rely on tools and technologies empowering them to self-diagnose and self-treat medical conditions. Given communications delays and limited bandwidth in future long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs), medical decision support technologies must empower the crew to manage routine medical activities, acute medical incidents, as well as emergency medical scenarios independently from ground support.The Autonomous Medical Response Agent (AMRA) is envisioned as a digital tool enabling crew to issue medical complaints and interact with a medical decision support algorithm which develops a differential diagnosis and recommends a treatment protocol for the condition. AMRA will draw from individual crew medical history in addition to crew symptoms to more efficiently identify high-risk medical conditions. A new symptom could be indicative of a chronic condition or a normal adaptation to long-duration spaceflight, but could just as easily be indicative of an adverse vehicle condition affecting the entire crew.While real-time communication with a flight surgeon may not possible, the crew will nonetheless require a means to communicate and document both routine and emergency medical incidents to ground support. Conversely, flight surgeons and medical specialists on the ground will need to understand information such as crew vitals or responses to medical check-ups and examinations within the larger context of crew schedule, mission activities, and vehicle performance. A user interface which establishes communication protocols between an individual crew member and AMRA, as well as ground support to the crew is a significant area of research demanding input and consideration.The design of AMRA AID is intended to: a) represent routine medical activities as well as new (unplanned) medical incidents within the larger context of crew schedule and mission activities, and b) increase confidence between ground support and crew members over the course of LDEMs. Maintaining situation awareness of unplanned medical incidents between ground and crew will be a critical element within LDEMs. Two medical incidents headache and difficulty breathing are being explored within a user interface prototype which captures communications protocols between crew members and mission control, human health monitoring, vehicle or environmental monitoring, as well as crew schedule and mission activities holistically.

20170010366,PRESENTATION,Ionizing Radiation Affects Gene Expression in Mouse Skin and Bone ,"[""Terada, Masahiro"",""Tahimic, Candice"",""Sowa, Marianne B."",""Schreurs, Ann-Sofie"",""Shirazi-Fard, Yasaman"",""Alwood, Joshua"",""Globus, Ruth K.""]","Future long-duration space exploration beyond low earth orbit will increase human exposure to space radiation and microgravity conditions as well as associated risks to skeletal health. In animal studies, radiation exposure (greater than 1 Gy) is associated with pathological changes in bone structure, enhanced bone resorption, reduced bone formation and decreased bone mineral density, which can lead to skeletal fragility. Definitive measurements and detection of bone loss typically require large and specialized equipment which can make their application to long duration space missions logistically challenging. Towards the goal of developing non-invasive and less complicated monitoring methods to predict astronauts' health during spaceflight, we examined whether radiation induced gene expression changes in skin may be predictive of the responses of skeletal tissue to radiation exposure. We examined oxidative stress and growth arrest pathways in mouse skin and long bones by measuring gene expression levels via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) after exposure to total body irradiation (IR). To investigate the effects of irradiation on gene expression, we used skin and femora (cortical shaft) from the following treatment groups: control (normally loaded, sham-irradiated), and IR (0.5 Gy 56Fe 600 MeV/n and 0.5 Gy 1H 150 MeV/n), euthanized at one and 11 days post-irradiation (IR). To determine the extent of bone loss, tibiae were harvested and cancellous microarchitecture in the proximal tibia quantified ex vivo using microcomputed tomography (microCT). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test. At one day post-IR, expression of FGF18 in skin was significantly greater (3.8X) than sham-irradiated controls, but did not differ at 11 days post IR. Expression levels of other genes associated with antioxidant response (Nfe2l2, FoxO3 and Sod1) and the cell cycle (Trp53, Cdkn1a, Gadd45g) did not significantly differ between the control and IR groups at either time point. Radiation exposure resulted in a 27.0% increase in FGF18-positive hair follicles at one day post-IR and returned to basal levels at 11 days post-IR. A similar trend was observed from FGF18 gene expression analysis of skin. In bone (femora), there was an increase in the expression of the pro-osteoclastogenic cytokine, MCP-1, one day after IR compared to non-irradiated controls. FGF18 expression in skin and MCP- 1 expression in bone were found to be positively correlated (P less than 0.002, r=0.8779). Further, microcomputed tomography analysis of tibia from these animals showed reduced cancellous bone volume (-9.9%) at 11 days post- IR. These results suggest that measurements of early radiation induced changes in FGF18 gene expression in skin may have value for predicting subsequent loss of cancellous bone mass. Further research may lead to the development of a relatively simple diagnostic tool for bone loss, with the advantage that hair follicles and skin are relatively easy to acquire from human subjects.","[{""submissionId"":20170010366,""id"":""9ff5d8a3222a4c44903ae504c6e60da1"",""publicationDate"":""2017-07-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170010366,""endDate"":""2017-07-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""2017 ISSR&D (International Space Station Research and Development) Conference"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""54c6c4c964eb440aaf394d33c128a7bb"",""startDate"":""2017-07-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C"",""NNA16BD14C"",""NNH15CO48B"",""NCC 9-58""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170010366
20230006155,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Automated Fluidics Device for Extraction and Quantification of miRNA Biomarkers From Blood,"[""Tristen Head"",""Michael Padgen"",""Kira  Rienecker"",""Nagendra Dhanikonda"",""Antonio Ricco"",""Macarena Parra"",""Victor Yeh"",""Yasaman Shirazi-Fard""]","Radiation Assessment DuRing Exposure And long-Duration Spaceflight (RADREADS) demonstrates space-compatible point-of-care technology for quantitative biological monitoring of blood miRNA biomarkers in response to long-term low dose radiation exposure. This individualized monitoring approach will inform targeted treatment strategies to maximize medical resource utilization by accounting for individual susceptibility to radiation-related illnesses.

As human spaceflight progresses beyond Earth’s magnetic shielding, radiation exposure poses a significant risk to astronaut health and safety. Extended operation in this environment comes with an increased risk of radiation exposure, leading to higher risks of radiation sickness, cancer, central nervous system effects, and degenerative diseases. While conventional physical dosimetry techniques capture radiation dose, individualistic susceptibility to radiation damage is varied. Multiple characteristics, including age, body weight, sex, genetics, and immune status, have been found to influence radiosensitivity (Liu et al. 2011, and Bouffler 2016). This differential response necessitates individualized monitoring and targeted treatment strategies to maximize medical resource utilization; however, a practical diagnostic platform for quantifying long-term, low dose radiation-induced tissue damage does not currently exist. 

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by mediating the degradation of messenger RNA. The levels of particular miRNAs are influenced by biological processes such as inflammation and serve as biomarkers for a variety of conditions including cancer (Singh et al. 2017). MicroRNAs are found in various bodily fluids and are amenable to collection via liquid biopsies, providing a minimally invasive and easily quantifiable readout for a variety of radiosensitive reporters. A preliminary signature of 15 spaceflight sensitive miRNA has been identified in rodent and human studies, including miR-21-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-92a-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-16a-3p, miR-34a-3p, and miR-223-3p. These targets generally increased expression with radiation dose and linear energy transfer, though variation between individuals is not yet described.   

Current gaps in the field include a lack of understanding of longitudinal biological responses to long-term, low dose radiation exposure and the absence of space-compatible point-of-care technology for quantitative biological monitoring. In this body of work, we aim to develop an automated bleed-to-read system to process whole blood for the detection of miRNA biomarkers in order to monitor individualistic responses to radiation exposure. This will be achieved via separating serum (or plasma) from whole blood, followed by extraction, amplification, and quantification of the miRNA using a RT-qPCR reaction. Previously, the WetLab-2 hardware enabled execution of a RT-qPCR reaction aboard ISS; however, it is a manual system that requires crew manipulation and bulky components (Parra et al. 2017). To address these issues, automated fluid handling hardware was developed for each stage of sample preparation. Extraction of total RNA is achieved by sequentially pumping reagents through an off-the-shelf nucleic acid binding column (miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Advanced Kit, Qiagen). This approach eliminates several manual pipetting and centrifuging steps and limits the use of toxic chemicals commonly found in other sample processing techniques. The resulting elution will then be automatically dispensed for RT-qPCR analysis using a compact rotary qPCR (Mic qPCR Cycler, Bio Molecular Systems) that will improve spaceflight compatibility by removing bubbles from the detection region, another challenge highlighted by WetLab-2 (Parra et al. 2017). Efforts are also being made to simplify the RT-qPCR reaction to a 1-step air-dryable mix to improve long-term reagent stability at room temperature and reduce system complexity. 

By automating the RT-qPCR processes via microfluidic manipulation, RADREADS will reduce crewmember hands-on time and enable the personalized detection of radiation-induced tissue damage during long duration missions. Minimally invasive, longitudinal monitoring of individual’s response to radiation exposure will inform how the physiological system responds to long-term low dose space radiation and enables development of targeted countermeasures by the medical team.  Ultimately, this portable technology will require minimal technical expertise and can also be used to monitor miRNA biomarkers associated with other diseases.","[{""submissionId"":20230006155,""publisher"":"""",""id"":""2908ae5578f440e1bc7341f06a2c52cf"",""publicationName"":"" "",""publicationDate"":""2023-07-01T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230006155,""endDate"":""2023-08-03T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""3c331303e1885ed4b4fd4970bd6f644a"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Center for the Advancement of Science in Space"",""location"":""Melbourne, Florida, United States""}},""meetingId"":""83fba9e173494c088f9b07435a4a436d"",""id"":""6e5d0453fdbd4474b6a036bc4149d923""},{""organizationId"":""8f0b2d06f40f562aa1db2c42c5c2f80d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Astronautical Society"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""83fba9e173494c088f9b07435a4a436d"",""id"":""a06de496c4914ebbac82d888ba7db086""},{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""83fba9e173494c088f9b07435a4a436d"",""id"":""5c3d5591ce8c407880ae38fb5c70c2a5""}],""name"":""12th Annual International Space Station  Research and Development Conference"",""location"":""Seattle, WA"",""id"":""83fba9e173494c088f9b07435a4a436d"",""url"":""https://www.issconference.org/"",""startDate"":""2023-07-31T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""663323.08.21.01""]",undefined,"[""Space Radiation""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230006155

20230001374,PRESENTATION,Verification Testing and Veg-05 Tomato Crop Production on the International Space Station,"[""Gioia D. Massa"",""Grace L. Douglas"",""Mary E. Hummerick"",""Matthew W. Romeyn"",""LaShelle E. Spencer"",""Raymond M. Wheeler"",""Millennia Young""]","Production of fresh, nutritious, and tasty produce for astronauts during spaceflight may provide health-promoting, bioavailable nutrients and enhance the dietary experience as we move into longer-duration missions.  Growing and caring for plants may also reduce the psychological stresses associated with spaceflight and enhance connections to Earth.  Requirements to consistently grow a diversity of crops under spaceflight environmental conditions remain poorly defined.  The VEG-05 experiment is part of a series of experiments with pick-and-eat salad crops to better define best practices for crop production and handling in space.  VEG-05 and predecessor experiments VEG-04A and VEG-04B, use the Veggie vegetable production facilities on the International Space Station to grow salad crops under different spectral compositions.  In VEG-04A and B, mizuna mustard was cultivated with two different red: blue light treatments, and in VEG-05 we are cultivating ‘Red Robin’ dwarf cherry tomatoes under the same light spectra.  Light can impact the growth habit, yield, nutritional composition, microbial levels, and even flavor attributes within crops, and our team will assess these characteristics for this crop during VEG-05.  Prior to launch and installation on ISS in late 2022, both a science verification test (SVT), and an experiment verification test (EVT) were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in ISS Environment Simulator Chambers.  Science verification testing, and a previous fertilizer test, grew plants in both plant pillows and PONDS (Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System) units and tested two different fertilizer treatments in both sets of hardware, with each test under only one of the light conditions.  Because of challenges validating the PONDS hardware on ISS, and with good crop production in plant pillows, the EVT moved forward using only plant pillows with the highest fertilizer composition tested during SVT, and two Veggie units were utilized.  One Veggie had light settings consisting of equal levels of red: blue light (150 µmol/m2/s for each color) plus green light (30 µmol/m2/s) while the second Veggie had a 90:10 ratio of red: blue light (270 µmol/m2/s red and 30 µmol/m2/s blue) plus green, so each unit provided 330 µmol/m2/s of photosynthetically active radiation to the tomato crops on average.  Our original plan, based on prior ground testing, was to grow the crop for 104 days and harvest at 80, 90 and 104 days after initiation.  For SVT, under the equal red: blue light treatment, fruit ripening in plant pillows was delayed and fruit were not ripe by day 80, so actual harvest days were days 90, 97, and 104.  For EVT we saw fruit ripening earlier, especially in the high red treatment, and so we harvested at days 83, 90, and 99 days after initiation.  In SVT we had mostly daily watering, and this led to excess water in plant pillows, which leaked out.  This excess water also caused fungus to grow on one leaf and a couple of plant stems.  To reduce this excess moisture, we throttled back the watering for EVT, and used the root mat reservoir more frequently. This led to watering only every other day, reducing crew time needed for plant care, however, two wilting events occurred during this EVT, at days 51 and 75.  Plants recovered from these wilting events, but these events may have influenced the rate of fruit ripening and flower formation. Regardless, more than 10 fruit were produced from each plant on average, with the high red treatment producing slightly heavier fruit.  Microbial testing from fruit during SVT indicated that fruit were safe for consumption with microbial levels below detection limits.  VEG-05 flight and ground operations are expected to run between December 2022 and March 2023.

Three missions were undertaken from 2014‐2015, NEEMO's 18‐20. All missions were performed at the Aquarius undersea research habitat. During each mission, the effects of varying operations concepts and tasks type and complexity on representative communication latencies associated with Mars missions were studied. METHODS: 12 subjects (4 per mission) were weighed out to simulate near‐zero or partial gravity extravehicular activity (EVA) and evaluated different operations concepts for integration and management of a simulated Earth‐based science backroom team (SBT) to provide input and direction during exploration activities. Exploration traverses were planned in advance based on precursor data collected. Subjects completed science‐related tasks including presampling surveys, geologic‐based sampling, and marine‐based sampling as a portion of their tasks on saturation dives up to 4 hours in duration that were to simulate extravehicular activity (EVA) on Mars or the moons of Mars. One‐way communication latencies, 5 and 10 minutes between space and mission control, were simulated throughout the missions. Objective data included task completion times, total EVA times, crew idle time, translation time, SBT assimilation time (defined as time available for SBT to discuss data/imagery after it has been collected, in addition to the time taken to watch imagery streaming over latency). Subjective data included acceptability, simulation quality, capability assessment ratings, and comments. RESULTS: Precursor data can be used effectively to plan and execute exploration traverse EVAs (plans included detailed location of science sites, high‐fidelity imagery of the sites, and directions to landmarks of interest within a site). Operations concepts that allow for presampling surveys enable efficient traverse execution and meaningful Mission Control Center (MCC) interaction across long communication latencies and can be done with minimal crew idle time. Imagery and information from the EVA crew that is transmitted real‐time to the intravehicular (IV) crewmember(s) can be used to verify that exploration traverse plans are being executed correctly. That same data can be effectively used by MCC (across comm latency) to provide further instructions to the crew from a SBT on sampling priorities, additional tasks, and changes to the plan. Text / data capabilities are preferred over voice capabilities between MCC and IV when executing exploration traverse plans over communication latency. Autonomous crew planning tools can be effective at modifying existing plans if the objectives and constraints are clearly defined.","[{""submissionId"":20150012229,""id"":""b22160345cf948dfa8dfbb2d0cd4f5bf"",""publicationDate"":""2016-03-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150012229,""name"":""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"",""location"":""New York, NY, United States"",""id"":""b6bd5acaed624eafb0736807c6f9dbd3""},{""submissionId"":20150012229,""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""Reston, VA, United States"",""id"":""dfa28775cf5642308e58090de7fb4f82""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150012229,""endDate"":""2016-03-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""1ceaa8d6b5e34baa9300b80c5b03c635"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Prognostics and Health Management Society (PHM)"",""location"":""Rochester, NY, United States""}},""meetingId"":""2eae4b55aaa24754b42a43389de0d2c1"",""id"":""5a86b4b43b50469598b1be02356598dc""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"",""location"":""New York, NY, United States""}},""meetingId"":""2eae4b55aaa24754b42a43389de0d2c1"",""id"":""7d7e49f68850432081206a9de1340d77""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""Reston, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""2eae4b55aaa24754b42a43389de0d2c1"",""id"":""1ba660e06f7c4935a4d63406c01277a0""}],""name"":""2016 IEEE Aerospace Conference"",""location"":""Big Sky, MT"",""id"":""2eae4b55aaa24754b42a43389de0d2c1"",""startDate"":""2016-03-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Communications, Spacecraft Communications, Command And Tracking"",""Lunar And Planetary Science And Exploration""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150012229
20160005440,OTHER,Technical Reference Suite Addressing Challenges of Providing Assurance for Fault Management Architectural Design,"[""Fitz, Rhonda"",""Whitman, Gerek""]","Research into complexities of software systems Fault Management (FM) and how architectural design decisions affect safety, preservation of assets, and maintenance of desired system functionality has coalesced into a technical reference (TR) suite that advances the provision of safety and mission assurance. The NASA Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Program, with Software Assurance Research Program support, extracted FM architectures across the IV&V portfolio to evaluate robustness, assess visibility for validation and test, and define software assurance methods applied to the architectures and designs. This investigation spanned IV&V projects with seven different primary developers, a wide range of sizes and complexities, and encompassed Deep Space Robotic, Human Spaceflight, and Earth Orbiter mission FM architectures. The initiative continues with an expansion of the TR suite to include Launch Vehicles, adding the benefit of investigating differences intrinsic to model-based FM architectures and insight into complexities of FM within an Agile software development environment, in order to improve awareness of how nontraditional processes affect FM architectural design and system health management. The identification of particular FM architectures, visibility, and associated IV&V techniques provides a TR suite that enables greater assurance that critical software systems will adequately protect against faults and respond to adverse conditions. Additionally, the role FM has with regard to strengthened security requirements, with potential to advance overall asset protection of flight software systems, is being addressed with the development of an adverse conditions database encompassing flight software vulnerabilities. Capitalizing on the established framework, this TR suite provides assurance capability for a variety of FM architectures and varied development approaches. Research results are being disseminated across NASA, other agencies, and the software community. This paper discusses the findings and TR suite informing the FM domain in best practices for FM architectural design, visibility observations, and methods employed for IV&V and mission assurance.","[{""submissionId"":20160005440,""id"":""0a190738edeb4d8d83c61ebc4144374c"",""publicationDate"":""2016-04-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160005440,""endDate"":""2016-04-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""d3f630c3b7134a3f9d682a9be750d4fa"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Space Foundation"",""location"":""Colorado Springs, CO, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f39faa0cb0f04318932db7d546621584"",""id"":""44769c54cf9c43a3bc6154db2a5bab89""}],""name"":""Space Symposium"",""location"":""Colorado Springs, CO"",""id"":""f39faa0cb0f04318932db7d546621584"",""startDate"":""2016-04-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNG12SA03C""]",undefined,"[""Computer Programming And Software""]","[{""id"":20160005441,""title"":""Technical Reference Suite Addressing Challenges of Providing Assurance for Fault Management Architectural Design""},{""id"":20160005441,""title"":""Technical Reference Suite Addressing Challenges of Providing Assurance for Fault Management Architectural Design""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160005440
20170002579,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Monitoring of the Atmosphere on the International Space Station with the Air Quality Monitor,"[""Wallace William T."",""Limero, Thomas F."",""Loh, Leslie J."",""Mudgett, Paul D."",""Gazda, Daniel B.""]","During the early years of human spaceflight, short duration missions allowed for monitoring of the spacecraft environment to be performed via archival sampling, in which samples were returned to Earth for analysis. With the construction of the International Space Station (ISS) and the accompanying extended mission durations, the need for enhanced, real-time monitors became apparent. The Volatile Organic Analyzer (VOA) operated on ISS for 7 years, where it assessed trace volatile organic compounds in the cabin air. The large and fixed-position VOA was eventually replaced with the smaller Air Quality Monitor (AQM). Since March 2013, the atmosphere of the U.S. Operating Segment (USOS) has been monitored in near real-time by a pair of AQMs. These devices consist of a gas chromatograph (GC) coupled with a differential mobility spectrometer (DMS) and currently target detection list of 22 compounds. These targets are of importance to both crew health and the Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) on ISS. Data is collected autonomously every 73 hours, though the units can be controlled remotely from mission control to collect data more frequently during contingency or troubleshooting operations. Due to a nominal three-year lifetime on-orbit, the initial units were replaced in February 2016. This paper will focus on the preparation and use of the AQMs over the past several years. A description of the technical aspects of the AQM will be followed by lessons learned from the deployment and operation of the first set of AQMs. These lessons were used to improve the already-excellent performance of the instruments prior to deployment of the replacement units. Data trending over the past several years of operation on ISS will also be discussed, including data obtained during a survey of the USOS modules. Finally, a description of AQM use for contingency and investigative studies will be presented.","[{""submissionId"":20170002579,""id"":""7a13a852972b46ed82b8d25de0b119ed"",""publicationDate"":""2017-07-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20170002579,""name"":""International Conference On Environmental Systems, Inc."",""location"":""Stafford Springs, CT, United States"",""id"":""dc72556f7e65441da77ac6eae9ff2214""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170002579,""endDate"":""2017-07-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Conference On Environmental Systems, Inc."",""location"":""Stafford Springs, CT, United States""}},""meetingId"":""1034b783ae1443fb8fa31ef2dcc03153"",""id"":""4b79a197787641c0af6d9988836987e8""}],""name"":""International Conference on Environmental Systems (ICES 2017)"",""location"":""Charleston, SC"",""id"":""1034b783ae1443fb8fa31ef2dcc03153"",""startDate"":""2017-07-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Space Transportation And Safety"",""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]","[{""id"":20170006511,""title"":""Monitoring of the Atmosphere on the International Space Station with the Air Quality Monitor""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170002579
20210021235,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Tracking Metabolic Changes in Microbial Culture using Redox Measurements,"[""Diana Gentry"",""Opinder Dhami"",""Lauren Liddell"",""Sergio Santa Maria""]","During long-term space missions, microbial cultures accumulate the effects of low-dose radiation, microgravity, and other factors; altered growth and metabolic activity may occur before viability effects.  This could affect functionality of bioreactors or other bio-enabled mission systems, as well as shed light on human health.  Spaceflight microbiology studies beyond the low Earth orbit exposure afforded by the ISS have been limited.  Nanosatellites offer an increasingly popular alternative for deep space missions.  However, the communications delay requires biofluidic automation of a pre-defined experimental protocol, and the lack of sample return (reliance on sensors in flight) can significantly limit feasible investigations.  Previous biological CubeSats (PharmaSat, O/OREOS, EcAMSat) have used alamarBlue, an off-the-shelf formulation of the redox indicator dye resazurin, to track metabolic activity, as will BioSentinel, the upcoming interplanetary microbiology experiment.

A series of ground experiments (see abstracts by Liddell, Santa Maria, and A. Kim) were conducted using a microbial culture system outfitted with an electrochemical sensor array (electrical conductivity, pH, oxidation-reduction potential, and dissolved oxygen) with alamarBlue and the same strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as BioSentinel.  By improving mapping of measured changes in alamarBlue kinetics to physicochemical changes, and ultimately to biological alterations such as shifted metabolic pathways, this work supplements data analyses from past missions and planning for future missions using alamarBlue to characterize space radiation effects.

Initial results indicate that alamarBlue acts like a redox buffer; its presence significantly changes redox kinetics in otherwise identical cultures.  The initial color change (blue resazurin reduced to red/pink resorufin) appears as a redox plateau.  A second plateau, likely corresponding to the second color transition (resorufin to the colorless hydroresorufin), occurs at a lower redox value.  The relationship to carbon source exhaustion, dissolved oxygen depletion, cell death, and measured redox potential is complex and still under study.

20240015371,PRESENTATION,Enabling Open and Interoperable Science: Multi-Omics Data Processing Platform with NASA GeneLab Standardized Bioinformatics Workflows for Space and Earth Research,"[""Amanda M. Saravia-Butler"",""Julia M. Kelliher"",""Alexis Torres"",""Lauren M. Sanders"",""Samrawit G. Gebre""]","Multi-omics biological data continues to be generated at an astounding pace. Genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics, or collectively known as multi-omics data, are used to assess biological functions, and provide invaluable insights into human, animal, plant, and environmental health both on Earth and in Space. Despite the abundance of these valuable data, the need for bioinformatics expertise, particularly as it relates to the niche filed of space biology, and a lack of accessible resources for processing these data limit their usefulness in deriving biological insights.

The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides access to omics data from various spaceflight and analog studies. To enhance the accessibility and reusability of these data, GeneLab (part of OSDR) designs and implements standardized, community-driven, open-source bioinformatics workflows to transform raw omics data into standardized processed data. Currently, GeneLab-processed data from hundreds of space studies have been reused for meta-analyses. This has led to new insights and scientific publications that extend beyond the initial research, thereby enriching our understanding of molecular-scale biological responses to the space environment. 

To make these bioinformatics workflows open and accessible, GeneLab teamed up with DOE-funded initiatives, including the National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC), to create the NASA EDGE [Empowering the Development of Genomics Expertise] Bioinformatics web-based platform. NASA EDGE utilizes shared compute resources to run the GeneLab standardized bioinformatics workflows, which eliminates the need for researchers to have their own high performance computing cluster. The web-based platform makes complicated biological analyses incredibly easy to perform, thus expanding the reach of these analyses to bioinformatics novices, students, and even citizen scientists enabling them to contribute to scientific discoveries and progress. 

The authors will demonstrate how the NASA EDGE platform can be used to process microbial omics data hosted on OSDR as well as user-generated omics datasets using GeneLab’s standard workflows.",[],"[{""country"":""PR"",""submissionId"":20240015371,""endDate"":""2024-12-07T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""a76ea705c5294f91a092d50f52bf97a8"",""id"":""5daf54d3b3bd47a986f234d4f5cf72b3""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) 2024 Conference"",""location"":""San Juan "",""id"":""a76ea705c5294f91a092d50f52bf97a8"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/asgsr-2024-puerto-rico/"",""startDate"":""2024-12-03T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""80ARC024DA004""]",undefined,"[""Space Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240015371

The model consists of a closed-loop lumped-parameter representation of the circulation connected to set-point models of the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflexes. Model parameters are largely based on literature values. Model verification was performed by comparing the simulation output under baseline conditions and at different levels of orthostatic stress to sets of population-averaged hemodynamic data reported in the literature. On the basis of experimental evidence, we adjusted some model parameters to simulate experimental data. Orthostatic stress simulations are not statistically different from experimental data (two-sided test of significance with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons). Transient response characteristics of heart rate to tilt also compare well with reported data. A case study is presented on how the model is intended to be used in the future to investigate the effects of post-spaceflight orthostatic intolerance.","[{""volume"":""92"",""submissionId"":20040088471,""issue"":""3"",""issn"":""8750-7587"",""id"":""d69f2ddcb4d645c68f39e38e1883877c"",""publicationName"":""Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. :  1985)"",""publicationDate"":""2002-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088471
20160008931,ABSTRACT,A Year in Space: Early Results and Lessons Learned from the First Year-Long Expedition Aboard the International Space Station,"[""Charles, J. B."",""Bogomolov, V. V.""]","Two ISS crewmembers recently completed the first year-long orbital stay in two decades. International cooperation was central to the success of Mikhail Kornienko from Russia and Scott Kelly from the United States. Their expedition leveraged current mission experience and capitalized on recent advances in health monitoring technology. This unique effort began in 2012 when the program managers of the ISS partner nations adopted two separate goals: greater multilateral cooperation to increase efficiency of inflight research and a year-long expedition to gain familiarity with in-flight durations approaching that required for a Mars mission. These goals were unified when a set of bilateral Russian and American human research investigations was assigned to the year-long mission, augmented by additional investigations from Europe and Japan. For example, Kelly was assigned 18 investigations (twice the complement on standard six-month missions) including two joint U.S.-Russian studies, and two Russian and two Japanese studies. The core set of American investigations was a repetition of six studies Kelly had done on his previous six-month ISS mission, to allow a direct comparison of physiological and behavioral responses of the longer and shorter durations in this single individual. The remainder of his assignments plus those of Kornienko were drawn from currently active national investigations documenting human adaptation to long-duration spaceflight factors or effectiveness of countermeasures against known deleterious adaptations. The two joint U.S.-Russian investigations were the flagship biomedical studies of the year-long expedition. The ""Fluid Shifts"" study collocated American research equipment alongside a Russian operational stressor device to document the pattern and impacts of the headward fluid shift long known to occur in weightlessness, including its role in ocular changes recently observed in some astronauts. The ""Field Test"" study investigated the ability of the astronaut and cosmonaut to perform rudimentary tasks requiring sensorimotor coordination immediately after landing to define human capabilities soon after landing on Mars after an extended transit. Both investigations were highly successful in large part to the thorough integration of the implementation processes of the two partners. Kelly's assignment as the one-year crewmember also provided a serendipitous opportunity for the ""Twins Study"" comparing changes in his body at the genetic level with those occurring on Earth in his identical twin brother Mark Kelly. Data analysis from this expedition will commence in earnest after frozen in-flight samples are delivered to Earth in May aboard a commercial cargo spacecraft. Detailed results are expected in early 2017. Preliminary results and implementation improvements will be reviewed in this presentation.","[{""submissionId"":20160008931,""id"":""7caa0ecf44224eceb4f64f339465e63a"",""publicationDate"":""2016-07-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160008931,""name"":""American Astronautical Society"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""a3b640ceb1b04cbdbfe0cf8820ada542""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160008931,""endDate"":""2016-07-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Astronautical Society"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""42549a3fa3974d52b95ffa7706de1358"",""id"":""04e399071d8b43b5994c58366f4b4852""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""42549a3fa3974d52b95ffa7706de1358"",""id"":""1a80b834610646bb8dbcb19e51201ec6""}],""name"":""International Space Station R&D Conference"",""location"":""San Diego, CA"",""id"":""42549a3fa3974d52b95ffa7706de1358"",""startDate"":""2016-07-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160008931
20080010616,ABSTRACT,Incidence of Latent Virus Shedding during Space Flight,"[""Mehta, Satish K."",""Cohrs, Randall J."",""Gilden, Donald H."",""Tyring, Stephen K."",""Ott, C. Mark"",""Pierson, Duane L.""]","Measurements of immune parameters of both cellular and innate immunity indicate alterations in immune function in astronauts. Immune changes are due to stress and perhaps other factors associated with launch, flight, and landing phases. Medical relevance of observed changes is not known. The reactivation of latent viruses has been identified as an important in vivo indicator of clinically relevant immune changes. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the presence of specific viral DNA in body fluids. Initial studies demonstrated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation during all 3 mission phases. EBV is shed in saliva following reactivation from B-cells. Incidence of EBV in saliva was higher than control subjects during all 3 mission phases. However, quantitative PCR revealed 10-fold higher levels of EBV DNA present in saliva collected during flight than found in pre- and post flight specimens. To determine if other latent viruses showed similar effects, cytomegalovirus (CMV), another herpes virus, shed in urine following reactivation was studied. A very low incidence (less than 2%) of CMV in urine is found in healthy, lowstressed individuals. However, 25-50% of astronauts shed CMV in their urine before, during, or after flight. Our studies are now focused on varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the etiological agent of chicken-pox during childhood and shingles later in life. We demonstrated reactivation of VZV and shedding of the virus during and after spaceflight in saliva of astronauts with no sign of active infection or symptoms. The maximum shedding of VZV occurred during the flight phase and diminishes rapidly during the first five days after landing. We have utilized the same PCR assay for VZV in a clinical study of shingles patients. Generally, shingles patients shed much more VZV in saliva than astronauts. However, the VZV levels in astronauts overlap with the lower range of VZV numbers in shingles patients. Saliva from shingles patients and astronauts were cultured and infectious VZV was recovered from both groups. We have concluded that multiple latent viruses do reactivate before, during, and after spaceflight and serve as very sensitive indicators for diminished cellular immunity. Future plans will be focused on the clinical risks posed by the reactivation of these viruses. Initial efforts will determine the effect of longer missions on the International Space Station on the reactivation patterns of these viruses.","[{""submissionId"":20080010616,""id"":""d2a1dcec3dca467e99dfbd2a69b73e66"",""publicationDate"":""2008-02-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20080010616,""endDate"":""2008-02-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""2008 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Conference"",""location"":""League City, TX"",""id"":""ddf6d2906984499b925b7fdaf6e9e8af"",""startDate"":""2008-02-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080010616

Principles of knowledge management-the systematic use and reuse of information, experience, and expertise to achieve a specific goal-are being applied throughout the agency. LSDA is also applying these solutions, which rely on a combination of content and collaboration technologies, to enable research teams to create, capture, share, and harness knowledge to do the things they do well, even better. In the early days of spaceflight, space life sciences data were collected and stored in numerous databases, formats, media-types and geographical locations. These data were largely unknown/unavailable to the research community. The Biomedical Informatics and Health Care Systems Branch of the Space Life Sciences Directorate at JSC and the Data Archive Project at ARC, with funding from the Human Research Program through the Exploration Medical Capability Element, are fulfilling these requirements through the systematic population of the Life Sciences Data Archive. This project constitutes a formal system for the acquisition, archival and distribution of data for HRP-related experiments and investigations. The general goal of the archive is to acquire, preserve, and distribute these data and be responsive to inquiries for the science communities. Information about experiments and data, as well as non-attributable human data and data from other species' are available on our public Web site http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov. The Web site also includes a repository for biospecimens, and a utilization process. NASA has undertaken an initiative to develop a Shuttle Data Archive repository. The Shuttle program is nearing its end in 2010 and it is critical that the medical and research data related to the Shuttle program be captured, retained, and usable for research, lessons learned, and future mission planning. Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do, and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly. LSDA works with the HRP community of practice to ensure that we are preserving the relevant research and data they need in the LSDA repository. An evidence-based approach to risk management is required in space life sciences. Evidence changes over time. LSDA has a pilot project with Collexis, a new type of Web-based search engine. Collexis differentiates itself from full-text search engines by making use of thesauri for information retrieval. The high-quality search is based on semantics that have been defined in a life sciences ontology. Additionally, Collexis' matching technology is unique, allowing discovery of partially matching dicuments. Users do not have to construct a complicated (Boolean) search query, but can simply enter a free text search without the risk of getting ""no results"". Collexis may address these issues by virtue of its retrieval and discovery capabilities across multiple repositories.","[{""submissionId"":20100005237,""id"":""626420b7c5d444b8ba0cfb4ce9e3e98e"",""publicationDate"":""2010-02-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20100005237,""endDate"":""2010-02-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""2010 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Annual Workshop"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""bb04c985343a440cbce25f63ab1a33e3"",""startDate"":""2010-02-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100005237
20240000754,WHITE_PAPER,Artificial Intelligence Medical Support for Long-Duration Space Missions,"[""Lauren Marie Sanders"",""Ryan Thomas Scott""]","We envision an artificial intelligence (AI) based system that will provide support and recommendations to the crew medical officer (CMO) and ground flight surgeon during long-duration space missions. Such a system would be pretrained on the knowledgebase of clinical knowledge on Earth, minimizing the amount of Earth data that needs to be transferred into space. Then during deployment, the system would be constantly refined through active learning from diverse streams of data from sensors in the spacecraft, data collected daily from individual astronauts, and human-in-the-loop feedback from the crew. The model could be interrogated for predictions and recommendations on personalized crew health based on the overall status of the spacecraft, medicinal stores, and status of other crew members. Adaptation techniques would be used to incorporate spaceflight data that have very different distributions from the training data due to the extreme environment. Edge computing and the most advanced neuromorphic processing would enable computation in scenarios with low power and bandwidth, while dimensionality reduction would be employed to ensure that the input data streams from spaceflight are as small as possible.
In order to realize this long-term vision, several hardware and software aspects need to be developed and assembled. First, models pretrained on Earth biomedical data would need to be evaluated for predictive accuracy, and the best one selected. That model would need to be adapted to learn from diverse, sparse, and inconsistently measured data streams, as well as human-in-the-loop feedback. A data integration, standardization, and dimensionality reduction methodology would need to be developed to handle all data types and feed them into the model. Once the software and data infrastructure is developed, it would need to be integrated with small footprint compute processors and tested in high-radiation, high-vibration, unregulated temperature situations. 
	As a short-term goal, we recommend to focus on the development of the data and model software structure. Several large language models (LLM) already exist that have been trained on Earth biomedical and clinical knowledgebases, including BioMedLLM, Med-PaLM, SPOKE LLM, and Foresight. These models need to be evaluated for accuracy and the best one chosen for a proof-of-concept structure, while maintaining awareness of the accelerating AI field and incorporating any newly improved model architectures as needed. Then, we recommend to develop a database of synthetic data types to mimic the diverse data streams that are expected in a long-duration space mission. This should include environmental and microbial data from the spacecraft, non-invasive data from wearables and point-of-care devices employed by astronauts, and more invasive molecular and physiological monitoring of clinical and biomarker data from astronauts. The data standardization methodology should be developed, and these data streams used to refine the clinical LLM. Several scenarios should be developed that could plausibly come up in a long-duration space mission, and changes or aberrations introduced to the data at specific times to mimic these scenarios. Then, question and answer tasks should be designed to interrogate the model for predictions and recommendations, with acceptable answers already identified.

T."",""Reschke, M."",""Bloomberg, J. J."",""Wood, S. J."",""Noohibezanjani, F."",""Kinnaird, C."",""Seidler, R. D."",""Mulavara, A. P.""]","Introduction: Over the last two decades, several studies have been published on the impact of long-duration (i.e., 22 days or longer) spaceflight on the central nervous system (CNS). In consideration of the health and performance of crewmembers in flight and post-flight, we are conducting a controlled prospective longitudinal study to investigate the effects of spaceflight on the extent, longevity and neural bases of sensorimotor, cognitive, and neural changes. Multiple studies have demonstrated the effects of spaceflight on the vestibular system. One of the supporting tests conducted in this protocol is the Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (VEMP) test that provides a unilateral measure of otolith (saccule and utricle) function. A different approach was taken for ocular VEMP (oVEMP) testing using a head striker system (Wackym et al. 2012). The oVEMP is generally considered to be a measure of utricle function. The the otolithic input to the inferior oblique muscle is predominately from the utricular macula. Thus, quantitatively, oVEMP tests utricular function. Another practical extension of these relationships is that the oVEMP reflects the superior vestibular nerve function. Methods: Ground testing was administered on 16 control subjects and for 8 subjects over four repeated sessions spanning 70 days. The oVEMP was elicitied via a hand held striker by a vibrotactile pulse presented at the rate of 1 Hz for 24 seconds on the side of the head as subjects lay supine on a gurney. Subjects were directed to gaze approximately 25 degrees above straight ahead in semi-darkness. For the oVEMP electromyograms will be recorded with active bipolar electrodes (Delsys Inc., Boston, MA) on the infra-orbital ridge 1 cm below the eyelid with a reference electrode on the below the knee cap. The EMG potentials were amplified; band-pass filtered using a BagnoliTM Desktop EMG System (Delsys Inc., Boston, MA, USA). This EMG signal is sampled at 10 kHz and the data stimulus onset to 100 MS was averaged over 24 trial repetitions for the vibrotactile VEMP. The typical oVEMP EMG response is an excitatory potential with first peak occurring at 11-12 ms and second peak at 18 ms. This requires a total recording time of approximately 29 seconds per trial which includes 5 seconds of no vibrotactile stimulation at the beginning of the protocol. The primary dependent measures consist of the latency and peak-to-peak amplitude from the EMG signals, which will be normalized to EMG levels at the beginning of the protocol. Data were collected for 3 repeated trials with striker stimulation on both the left and right side of the head Results: The oVEMP p1 range was observed at 3-14 ms and n1 at 7-19 ms. The striker system provided a consistent and rapid method for oVEMP testing. Discussion: Crew testing is in progress to determine changes in results between pre and post flight.","[{""submissionId"":20150021475,""id"":""ff45704556d24737b36c89ca97f30290"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150021475,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""c9b981cad49d44e7b854b40325f07f49""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150021475,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""0f2a12e66bf8467f90085ad4dad487e6"",""id"":""286ad4017e09455b88df29b6c0c1a565""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop: Integrated Pathways to Mars"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""0f2a12e66bf8467f90085ad4dad487e6"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NCC9-58"",""NNX11AR02G""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150021475

As missions leave low Earth orbit and explore deeper space, BHP supports and conducts research to enable a risk posture that considers the risk of adverse cognitive or behavioral conditions and psychiatric disorders “acceptable given mitigations,” for pre-, in, and post-flight.The Human System Risk Board (HSRB) determines the risk of various mission scenarios using a likelihood (per person per year) by consequences matrix examining those risks across two categories—long term health and operational (within mission). Colors from a stoplight signal are used by HSRB and quickly provide a means of assessing overall perceived risk for a particular mission scenario. Risk associated with the current six month missions on the ISS are classified as “accepted with monitoring” while planetary missions, such as a mission to Mars, are recognized to be a “red” risk that requires mitigation to ensure mission success.Currently, the HSRB deems that the risk of adverse cognitive or behavioral conditions and psychiatric outcomes requires mitigation for planetary missions owing to long duration isolation and radiation exposure (see Table 1). While limited research evidence exists from spaceflight, it is well known anecdotally that the shift from the two week shuttle missions to the six month ISS missions renders the psychological stressors of space as more salient over longer duration missions. Shuttle astronauts were expected just to tolerate any stressors that arose during their mission and were successful at doing so (Whitmire et al, 2013). While it is possible to deal with stressors such as social isolation and to live with incompatible crewmembers for two weeks on shuttle, “ignoring it” is much less likely to be a successful coping mechanism on station. For the longer missions of the ISS, astronauts require a larger, more robust set of coping skills and more psychological support. Evidence of this are the number of BHP’s Operational Psychology (Op Psy) staff who have been awarded silver Snoopys by long duration astronauts†, in the statements of praise for the Op Psy and Family Support Office teams, and in the written and oral statements from flown astronauts regarding difficulty of longer missions and how much Op Psy helped.","[{""submissionId"":20150016966,""id"":""a8255786dd2a466d9cccbfe40a2e5b28"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Radiation"",""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150016966
20140014059,ABSTRACT,Astronaut Preflight Cardiovascular Variables Associated with Vascular Compliance are Highly Correlated with Post-Flight Eye Outcome Measures in the Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) Syndrome Following Long Duration Spaceflight,"[""Otto, Christian"",""Ploutz-Snyder, R.""]","The detection of the first VIIP case occurred in 2005, and adequate eye outcome measures were available for 31 (67.4%) of the 46 long duration US crewmembers who had flown on the ISS since its first crewed mission in 2000. Therefore, this analysis is limited to a subgroup (22 males and 9 females). A ""cardiovascular profile"" for each astronaut was compiled by examining twelve individual parameters; eleven of these were preflight variables: systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, body mass index, percentage body fat, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, use of anti‐lipid medication, fasting serum glucose, and maximal oxygen uptake in ml/kg. Each of these variables was averaged across three preflight annual physical exams. Astronaut age prior to the long duration mission, and inflight salt intake was also included in the analysis. The group of cardiovascular variables for each crew member was compared with seven VIIP eye outcome variables collected during the immediate post‐flight period: anterior-posterior axial length of the globe measured by ultrasound and optical biometry; optic nerve sheath diameter, optic nerve diameter, and optic nerve to sheath ratio‐ each measured by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intraocular pressure (IOP), change in manifest refraction, mean retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) on optical coherence tomography (OCT), and RNFL of the inferior and superior retinal quadrants. Since most of the VIIP eye outcome measures were added sequentially beginning in 2005, as knowledge of the syndrome improved, data were unavailable for 22.0% of the outcome measurements. To address the missing data, we employed multivariate multiple imputation techniques with predictive mean matching methods to accumulate 200 separate imputed datasets for analysis. We were able to impute data for the 22.0% of missing VIIP eye outcomes. We then applied Rubin's rules for collapsing the statistical results across our 200 multiply imputed data sets to assess the canonical correlation between the eye outcomes and the twelve astronaut cardiovascular variables available for all 31 subjects. Results: A highly significant canonical correlation was observed among the canonical solutions (p<.00001), with an average best canonical correlation of.97. The results suggest a strong association between astronauts' measures of cardiovascular health and the seven eye outcomes of the VIIP syndrome used in this analysis. Furthermore, the ""joint test"" revealed a significant difference in cardiovascular profile between male and female astronauts (Prob > F = 0.00001). Overall, female astronauts demonstrated a significantly healthier cardiovascular status. Individually, the female astronauts had significantly healthier profiles on seven of twelve cardiovascular variables than the men (p values ranging from <0.0001 to <0.05). Male astronauts did not demonstrate significantly healthier values on any of the twelve cardiovascular variables measured ","[{""submissionId"":20140014059,""id"":""e5071e8c8f85444f86b87d3d871858bf"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140014059,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""3d04ec6434c44c6e8f803c8184e6b958""},{""submissionId"":20140014059,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""5267e6fb85f54a4c934ff977ab4d9dae""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140014059,""endDate"":""2015-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ca873c8edda34b479fa9e3ca94aa6519"",""id"":""f961b722ab4844f1b58974d4bac9f929""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ca873c8edda34b479fa9e3ca94aa6519"",""id"":""6c8eca265e7b41ebb81dab85d21548e4""}],""name"":""2015 Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""ca873c8edda34b479fa9e3ca94aa6519"",""startDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140014059
20160006323,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Implementing NASA's Capability-Driven Approach: Insight into NASA's Processes for Maturing Exploration Systems,"[""Williams-Byrd, Julie"",""Arney, Dale"",""Rodgers, Erica"",""Antol, Jeff"",""Simon, Matthew"",""Hay, Jason"",""Larman, Kevin""]","NASA is engaged in transforming human spaceflight. The Agency is shifting from an exploration-based program with human activities focused on low Earth orbit (LEO) and targeted robotic missions in deep space to a more sustainable and integrated pioneering approach. Through pioneering, NASA seeks to address national goals to develop the capacity for people to work, learn, operate, live, and thrive safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time. However, pioneering space involves more than the daunting technical challenges of transportation, maintaining health, and enabling crew productivity for long durations in remote, hostile, and alien environments. This shift also requires a change in operating processes for NASA. The Agency can no longer afford to engineer systems for specific missions and destinations and instead must focus on common capabilities that enable a range of destinations and missions. NASA has codified a capability driven approach, which provides flexible guidance for the development and maturation of common capabilities necessary for human pioneers beyond LEO. This approach has been included in NASA policy and is captured in the Agency's strategic goals. It is currently being implemented across NASA's centers and programs. Throughout 2014, NASA engaged in an Agency-wide process to define and refine exploration-related capabilities and associated gaps, focusing only on those that are critical for human exploration beyond LEO. NASA identified 12 common capabilities ranging from Environmental Control and Life Support Systems to Robotics, and established Agency-wide teams or working groups comprised of subject matter experts that are responsible for the maturation of these exploration capabilities. These teams, called the System Maturation Teams (SMTs) help formulate, guide and resolve performance gaps associated with the identified exploration capabilities. The SMTs are defining performance parameters and goals for each of the 12 capabilities, developing maturation plans and roadmaps for the identified performance gaps, specifying the interfaces between the various capabilities, and ensuring that the capabilities mature and integrate to enable future pioneering missions. By managing system development through the SMTs instead of traditional NASA programs and projects, the Agency is shifting from mission-driven development to a more flexible, capability-driven development. The process NASA uses to establish, integrate, prioritize, and manage the SMTs and associated capabilities is iterative. NASA relies on the Human Exploration and Operation Mission Directorate's SMT Integration Team within Advanced Exploration Systems to coordinate and facilitate the SMT process. The SMT Integration team conducts regular reviews and coordination meetings among the SMTs and has developed a number of tools to help the Agency implement capability driven processes. The SMT Integration team is uniquely positioned to help the Agency coordinate the SMTs and other processes that are making the capability-driven approach a reality. This paper will introduce the SMTs and the 12 key capabilities they represent. The role of the SMTs will be discussed with respect to Agency-wide processes to shift from mission-focused exploration to a capability-driven pioneering approach. Specific examples will be given to highlight systems development and testing within the SMTs. These examples will also show how NASA is using current investments in the International Space Station and future investments to develop and demonstrate capabilities. The paper will conclude by describing next steps and a process for soliciting feedback from the space exploration community to refine NASA's process for developing common exploration capabilities.","[{""submissionId"":20160006323,""id"":""6bfe029ef2cb4a748c97e7cfc1d4cb30"",""publicationDate"":""2015-08-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160006323,""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""Reston, VA, United States"",""id"":""d45fe6a0bb634ce792c48420caa5c2f0""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160006323,""endDate"":""2015-09-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""Reston, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""89c0ff2c7a2e448799593503c305978e"",""id"":""4b2f45d7e0254f1ea5aba59e9f495049""}],""name"":""AIAA SPACE 2015"",""location"":""Pasadena, CA"",""id"":""89c0ff2c7a2e448799593503c305978e"",""startDate"":""2015-08-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 934844.01.03.04""]",undefined,"[""Lunar And Planetary Science And Exploration""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160006323

However, requirements to support consistent growth of a variety of high-quality crops under spaceflight environmental conditions remain unclear. This study explores the potential to grow crops for consumption on the International Space Station (ISS) using Veggie, NASA’s vegetable production chamber system. VEG-04A and VEG-04B were two flight tests with ground components conducted with the leafy green crop mizuna mustard. In each location, mizuna was grown in two Veggie units simultaneously, with the chambers set to different red-to-blue-to-green light formulations. Preflight verification testing with various lighting treatments was conducted to down-select two treatments that contributed to the best desirable growth and sensory qualities in mizuna mustard. For the flight tests, one Veggie was programmed as “red-rich” with an average of 270 μmol m-2 s-1 of 630 nm red light, 30 μmol m-2 s-1 of 455 nm blue light, and 30 μmol m-2 s-1 of 530 nm green light. The second Veggie was “blue-rich” with an average of 150 µmol m-2 s-1 of 630 nm red light, 150 µmol m-2 s-1 of 455 nm blue light, and 30 µmol m-2 s-1 of 530 nm green light. Light quality is known to impact plant growth, nutrition, microbiology, and sensory characteristics on Earth, and the Veggie flight tests examined how these impacts might differ in microgravity. VEG-04A, a 35-day growth test with a single harvest, was initiated in June and harvested in July 2019. VEG-04B, a 56-day test with three harvests from the same plants, assessed sustained productivity. Preflight testing for VEG-04B was conducted after the VEG-04A flight test to improve the operations, approaches, and watering requirements, which resulted in better crop establishment in the VEG-04B flight test. VEG-04B was initiated in October 2019 with harvests at four, six, and eight weeks after initiation. At all of the harvests, the astronauts froze half of the edible plant tissue to return to Earth and weighed the remaining half using the Mass Measurement Device (MMD). Weighed samples were then cleaned with produce-sanitizing wipes, and consenting crew members participated in sensory evaluations of the fresh produce. The remaining sanitized produce was available for crew consumption as desired. Frozen flight samples were returned to Earth for chemical and microbial analyses to assess nutritional quality and food safety. Flight-grown mizuna was generally more acceptable to the crew and had higher nutrient levels, although mizuna grown in the ground control performed better in terms of higher yield and lower microbial load. This presentation will focus on results from the nutritional and sensory analyses, including how nutrients identified as key for supplementing the crew diet varied across lighting treatments, harvest approaches, and spaceflight versus ground conditions. It is our hope that these tests on the ISS will help mitigate the risk of an inadequate food supply for long-duration missions by adding fresh vegetables to the crew diet.

A."",""Myers, J.

Post-processing optimization allows IMM to optimize essential resources to improve a specific model outcome such as maximization of the Crew Health Index (CHI), or minimization of the probability of evacuation (EVAC) or the loss of crew life (LOCL). Mass and or volume constrain the optimized resource set. The IMMs probabilistic simulation uses input data on one hundred medical conditions to simulate medical events that may occur in spaceflight, the resources required to treat those events, and the resulting impact to the mission based on specific crew and mission characteristics. Because IMM version 4.0 provides for partial treatment for medical events, IMM Optimization 4.0 scores resources at the individual resource unit increment level as opposed to the full condition-specific treatment set level, as done in version 3.0. This allows the inclusion of as many resources as possible in the event that an entire set of resources called out for treatment cannot satisfy the constraints. IMM Optimization version 4.0 adds capabilities that increase efficiency by creating multiple resource sets based on differing constraints and priorities, CHI, EVAC, or LOCL. It also provides sets of resources that improve mission-related IMM v4.0 outputs with improved performance compared to the prior optimization. The new optimization represents much improved fidelity that will improve the utility of the IMM 4.0 for decision support.

20250000703,PRESENTATION,Assessment of the State of Communication Delay Research in Preparation for Missions Beyond Low Earth Orbit,"[""John A. Karasinski"",""Lauren B. Landon"",""Megan E. Parisi"",""Katie R. McTigue"",""Shu-Chieh Wu "",""Linda G. Morissette"",""Tina L. Panontin""]","NASA’s mission-operations paradigm, established during Project Mercury and minimally evolving through the Apollo Program, Space Shuttle Program, and ISS missions, has primarily depended on real-time support from a ground team of experts. This ground team has served as the safety net for crewed spaceflight missions over the past 60 years, managing the combined state of the mission, vehicle, and crew. However, this operational paradigm, which has seen little change in its Human-Systems Integration Architecture (HSIA), will face challenges during long-duration exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit. Lunar missions may experience one-way communication latencies ranging from 3 to 14 seconds, while Mars missions will encounter up to a 44-minute round-trip latency at a maximum distance from Earth. Communication delays negatively impact the behavioral health and performance of individuals and crews operating across the multi-team space-to-ground system. Previous research indicates that increased isolation and the challenges posed by delayed communication lead to heightened stress, frustration, adverse behavioral symptoms, and reduced individual performance. NASA has investigated the nature and effectiveness of managing this shift in complex operations since early 2000, but additional research is necessary to assess the issues associated with communication latencies and identify effective countermeasures. This work aimed to examine the evidence from 20 years of research on comm delays.

We systematically reviewed the past 20 years of communication delay literature, focusing on how this research aligns with relevant, high-priority needs in the HSIA, Team, and BMed Risks. This type of panoramic review has not been done since 2013; a current, aggregated picture of what has been studied and how is needed to inform additional studies and mitigation development. Additional perspectives were gained from interviews with the research participants, operations experts, and communication delay researchers. Results from this effort will help characterize the risk posed by communication latency for upcoming Artemis missions and point toward potential mitigations.

The final results will be presented. For the literature review, we formed a search term seed set drawing from languages used in two papers representative of the previous state of knowledge and supplemented it with additional search terms. We conducted literature searches on Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science and searched NASA project archives for output from NASA-sponsored research.

20170009806,PRESENTATION,Mapping by VESGEN of Blood Vessels in the Retinas of Astronauts Pre- and Post-Flight to the ISS,"[""Parsons-Wingerter, P."",""Vyas, R. J."",""Murray, M. C."",""Predovic, M."",""Lim, S."",""Vizzeri, G."",""Taibbi, G."",""Mason, S. S."",""Zanello, S. B."",""Young, M.""]","Research by NASA [1] established that significant risks for visual and ocular impairments associated with increased intracranial pressure (VIIP) are incurred by microgravity spaceflight, especially long-duration missions. It is well established in physiology and pathology that a fundamental role of the microvasculature is to mediate fluid transfers and remodel actively in response to environmental, immune and other stresses. We therefore hypothesize that remodeling of retinal blood vessels necessarily occurs during accommodation of microgravity-induced fluid shifts prior to subsequent development of visual and ocular impairments. Potential contributions of retinal vascular remodeling to VIIP etiology are therefore being investigated by NASA's innovative VESsel GENeration Analysis (VESGEN) software for two studies: (1) U.S. crew members before and after ISS missions, and (2) head-down tilt in human subjects before and after 70 days of bed rest. We anticipate that results of the two studies will be complete by the Investigators Workshop (January 22, 2017). METHODS: For the 2013 NASA NRA award, we are concluding the analysis of 30 degree infrared (IR) Heidelberg Spectralis images of retinal blood vessels by VESGEN (patents pending), a mature, automated software developed as a translational and basic vascular research discovery tool, particularly for retinal vascular disease. Subjects of our retrospective study include eight ISS crew members monitored for routine occupational surveillance pre- and post-flight, who provided their study consents to NASAs Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health (LSAH) in coordination with approval of the VESGEN retrospective study protocol by NASAs Institutional Review Board (IRB). The ophthalmic retinal images (average image resolution, approximately 5.6 microns per pixel) are blinded as to pre and post ISS status until the second portion of our study, when VESGEN results will be correlated with other ophthalmic and medical findings for the crew members. Due to image resolution challenges, a novel Matlab tool was developed for aligning pre and post images, and comparing (querying) the two images for differences in the morphology of small vessels. RESULTS: During the past year, LSAH approved the release of all astronaut retinal images to our study for VESGEN analysis. Substantial progress on the initial blinded portion of the study is in place. We anticipate that VESGEN analysis of the 32 Spectralis IR retinal images will be complete for presentation at the 2017 IWS meeting. CONCLUSIONS: Modified retinal vascular patterning may offer early-stage predictions of ocular changes resulting in decreased visual acuity for the VIIP syndrome. Novel insights provided by VESGEN into progressively pathological and blinding vascular remodeling in the human retina currently help to guide other NIH- and NASA-supported therapeutic studies of retinal disease and modeling of the VIIP risk. Results of our vascular investigation of the retinas of astronauts pre- and post-flight may help advance the understanding of both healthy and pathological adaptations to fluid shifts in microgravity associated with the VIIP syndrome. Preliminary results indicate that imaging of higher resolution, such as the new OCT angiography (OCT-A) technology, will be required to determine conclusively the role of the smaller retinal and choroidal vessels in VIIP etiology.","[{""submissionId"":20170009806,""id"":""2f2c6aa2dc884877a5421aea56e1af56"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170009806,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f6e5d0afcc58425b9880876c16d385ba"",""id"":""f2cab41b5d844488980b5be1b4f94407""}],""name"":""2017 Human Research Program Investigator''s Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""f6e5d0afcc58425b9880876c16d385ba"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B"",""NNX15AG98A"",""NNA14AA60C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170009806

20240011647,ABSTRACT,Developing Mars-Based Clinical Scenarios for an Earth Independent Medical Operations (EIMO) – Based Decision Support Service,"[""Prashant Parmar"",""Arian Anderson"",""Gina Vega"",""Derek Nusbaum"",""Ariana Nelson"",""David Hilmers"",""Marina Parker""]","As crewed missions move beyond Low-Earth Orbit, pre-mission planning cannot fully buy down the medical risks of exploration-class missions. Martian missions, where increased hazards exist, (such as long-duration spaceflight, surface-level EVA operations, and communications delays) will require a paradigm shift in the structure of a medical system. An Earth-Independent Medical Operations-based Medical System (EIMO-MS) will need to optimize four critical domains to help provide medical care: utilization of Pre-Mission Planning, augmentation of Acute and Prolonged Medical Decision Making, automated tracking of Resource Management, and assistance in Task Load Balance. The ideal EIMO-MS will be able to accomplish this goal by having an interactive, adaptable interface that will be able to provide real-time medical services.  It must respond based on the level of crewmember training, medical situation, and available medical and non-medical resources.

To showcase the capabilities and requirements of such a sophisticated automated MS, a series of clinical scenarios of escalating complexity were developed with clinical and systems engineering input. These scenarios describe in clinical detail what a theoretical future medical system, enhanced with multiple information streams (such as a medical database, an AI-based Decision Support System, real-time monitoring, enhanced in-situ laboratory imaging, etc.) can achieve in conjunction with a trained and experienced crew. 

Scenarios are comprised of: a context section including objectives and applicable spaceflight environment, a highlighted assumptions section, a clinical narrative section, and a systems engineering activity diagram demonstrating the integrated Medical System (MS). The “swim lanes” of the activity diagram act as the logistical core of each scenario and show how the MS will interact with the crew, ground support, and other in-flight systems. The Design Reference Mission that is used for the scenarios is based on existing reference mission profiles [1] with a projected 30-sol stay on the Martian surface. Scenarios span the spectrum from planned evaluations, minor medical care, urgent care, surgical guidance, critical and expectant management, and behavioral health care.

Mission complexity will exponentially increase during deep space and Mars exploration-class missions, and medical support for these missions will likewise need to increase in autonomy and adaptability. The integrated system that will support these missions will need to provide assistance in a variety of anticipated and unforeseen scenarios. These medical scenarios, guided by clinician input, are initial steps in crafting the requirements for an EIMO-based medical system. By working in a systems engineering framework, requirements and capabilities can be extracted and mapped while maintaining a clinical core.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240011647,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6b89c7e01555449ca1c9ec3a829f8065"",""id"":""73f28200bace4e878ce8ca925347c861""}],""name"":""Human Research Program-Investigators Working Group (HRP-IWG) Workshop "",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""6b89c7e01555449ca1c9ec3a829f8065"",""url"":""https://www.nasa.gov/hrp-iws-2025/ "",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B"",""NNX16AO69A"",""80LARC23DA003""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]","[{""id"":20250000053,""title"":""Developing Mars-Based Clinical Scenarios for an Earth Independent Medical Operations (EIMO) – Based Decision Support Service""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240011647
20040141840,REPRINT,Preparing for Mars: the physiologic and medical challenges,"[""Buckey, J. C. Jr""]","As the twentieth century closes, retrospectives cite the Apollo moon missions as one of the important events of the past 100 years. A trip to Mars, however, would be even more challenging and significant. A round-trip Mars journey would require nearly three years away from Earth, a significant leap in complexity compared to the two week long Moon trips or the record-breaking fourteen-month flight on Mir. What would be the physiologic and medical challenges of a Mars flight? Two key areas of physiology present the greatest potential problems--calcium metabolism and radiation exposure. Data from Mir missions show that bone loss continues in space despite an aggressive countermeasure program. Average losses were 0.35% per month, but some load bearing areas lost >1% per month. A 1% loss rate, if it continued unabated for 30 months, could produce osteoporosis. Smaller losses could still increase fracture risk. Some bone loss can be well tolerated, particularly if the bone can be regained after the mission. But the effectiveness of post-flight rehabilitation to restore the density and quality of bone after spaceflight is not well known. Bone loss estimates are based on continuous weightlessness exposure, but this is not a requirement for a Mars trip. Most of the time on a Mars trip will be spent in the 1/3 Earth's gravity environment on Mars, and either intermittent or continuous artificial gravity can be provided for the transit between planets (although at an engineering cost). The dosing of the gravity exposure (e.g. the level and duration), however, has not been established. Radiation protection also requires a balance between engineering cost and human health. Excessive shielding could add billions of dollars to the cost of a mission. Trips in interplanetary space, however, expose the crew to heavy high-energy particles from cosmic rays (HZE particles), which have a high linear energy transfer. This high energy leads to significant biological damage (e.g. chromosomal aberrations, cancer induction). A recent report from the Committee on Space Biology and Medicine notes that only one systematic study of cancer induction from high-energy particles has been conducted (using the mouse Harderian gland). Predictions of cancer risk and acceptable radiation exposure in space are extrapolated from minimal data. Other areas of physiology also present problems, such as muscle loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, and vestibular adaptation. Despite all the issues, however, a focussed, aggressive research program that uses the resources of the International Space Station should pave the way for mankind's greatest adventure--a trip to Mars.","[{""volume"":""4"",""submissionId"":20040141840,""issue"":""9"",""issn"":""0949-2321"",""id"":""2803585bf3564dc7a68a7369ab370031"",""publicationName"":""European journal of medical research"",""publicationDate"":""1999-09-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Lunar And Planetary Science And Exploration""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040141840

20240012132,ABSTRACT,Evaluation of Markerless Motion Capture for Monitoring Sensorimotor Performance ,"[""Hannah M. Weiss"",""Scott J. Wood""]","<b>BACKGROUND</b>
Astronauts returning from long-duration exposure to microgravity frequently exhibit alterations in sensorimotor function leading to postural imbalance, impaired locomotion, and operational challenges to manual control. Mission duration and individual responses often influence both the severity of performance decrements and the variability in adaptation timelines. Postflight disruptions during functional tasks are often detected through body-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) devices. While IMU sensors are relatively compact, the long-term wear may lead to discomfort, displacement of the sensors on the body, and restrictions in movement or crew behavior. Although IMU data offers valuable insights from a research standpoint, interpreting changes in pre- and post-flight measures can be difficult for crew support personnel beyond the research domain, which can hinder the application for medical assessments and rehabilitation. Finally, the availability of inertial sensors in-flight is limited. There is a need for unobtrusive monitoring tools to improve our ability to monitor adaptation following gravitational transitions in various postflight evaluations and rehabilitation settings. Markerless motion capture (MMC) is an evolving unobtrusive technology that builds upon decades of research with marker-based motion capture systems to provide 3D human pose estimation from multiple synchronized 2D camera views using deep learning algorithms. Markerless technology can revolutionize how data is captured pre- and post-flight and potentially in-flight during intravehicular activity by enabling pose estimation of multiple crew members from onboard camera hardware.

<b>METHODS</b>
The following presents the initial evaluation of a state-of-the-art commercial-off-the-shelf MMC system, Theia Markerless, compared to IMU devices during various ground-based functional tasks and environmental conditions. The featured functional tasks include assessments from Human Research Program (HRP) funded studies such as Sensorimotor Standard Measures and Sensorimotor Assessments. Synchronous data collected using both motion capture and IMUs are analyzed for six male and female subjects of varying anthropometry. The analysis includes limited assessments of clothing, capture volume configurations, and the tool's sensitivity to detecting performance changes after a spaceflight analog centrifuge exposure. The development of visualization tools to enhance the application of the pose estimation output is also presented.

<b>RESULTS</b>
Initial results demonstrate comparable root mean square error (RMSE) to existing literature evaluating markerless and marker-based motion capture systems. Considering the relative functional range of motion of the cervical spine, normalized error values for the markerless system’s accuracy of the head was 0.032 in pitch, 0.025 in roll, and 0.018 in yaw plane of motion across a subset of functional tasks. The raw RMSE values were 3.49, 2.25, and 2.81 degrees respectively. For the torso, results suggest normalized errors of 0.469 in pitch, 0.191 in roll, and 0.307 in yaw planes of motion and raw RMSE values of 3.52, 1.53, and 3.07 degrees respectively. The data suggests the functional demands of a particular task influences the estimation accuracy of the MMC system where more dynamic motion and cases where subjects are not upright may introduce diminished tracking accuracy.

<b>DISCUSSION</b>
The following work lays the foundation for future implementations leveraging markerless motion capture to assess the time course of recovery and provide insight for rehabilitation protocols to enhance crew readiness for the resumption of daily activities. These tools offer effective methods for anonymizing sensitive crew data, facilitating numerous applications across research, medical, and rehabilitation groups. Collaborations with the Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility will provide further comparisons of the Markerless system to a marker-based system.

Castro"",""G. Marie Sharp"",""Sarah L. Castro-Wallace""]","Microbial monitoring of the International Space Station (ISS) atmosphere is vital to maintaining the health of the spacecraft and crew. Key to NASA’s microbial risk assessment is the identity of contaminating microorganisms in the environment. Historically, this has been achieved through impaction-based air sampling followed by culture. Identification of the microorganisms present requires sample return to Earth and lab-based analyses. While this culture-based approach has served to provide alerts to anomalies and overall confidence in the controls in place, it is not suitable for exploration missions with no sample return. Recently, significant advancements in molecular-based microbial monitoring via nanopore sequencing have been implemented onboard the ISS. Building on this work, multiple commercially available air samplers, compatible with downstream molecular analysis, were evaluated for use in the spaceflight environment. Through this assessment, the Coriolis Compact (Bertin Technologies), which uses cyclonic technology to collect bioaerosols onto the surface of a sterile cone, was selected for a larger-scale comparison to the current culture-based monitoring method. Using the Coriolis Compact, 1000 L of air was collected from the breakroom of an office building and a fitness center. The buffer used to dissociate the microbial cells from the surface of the cone was split between the NASA Microbiology Laboratory’s standard culture and Sanger sequencing-based method and the culture-independent nanopore sequencing method. The bacteria identified through culture were present in the nanopore data, with Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Moraxella being the most common cultured isolates, which is expected based on the media and growth conditions. Not surprisingly, the nanopore data yielded much higher diversity and paralleled that of previous atmospheric microbiome studies of human-occupied built environments. As compared to the culture-based data where the breakroom and fitness center data sets cluster in proximity, the nanopore data depicts the contrast of these atmospheric microbiomes. Moreover, the nanopore data were sufficient to meet NASA’s risk assessment needs and noted the culturable isolates routinely observed. This nanopore-based atmospheric microbial profiling method will enable near real-time environmental monitoring of crewed spacecraft as future missions extend beyond low-Earth orbit.

V.""]","As NASA and other space agencies prepare for future long-term space missions beyond the LEO, the cumulative impact of risk factors encountered in space increases substantially rising concerns about astronauts health. Application of on-board medications to mitigate clinical symptoms associated with certain medical conditions and illnesses is the first line of response to ensure sustainable health and performance of crew. Unfortunately, very limited research has been conducted to determine efficacy of the earth-based pharmaceuticals in a microgravity environment. In some instances, orally administered medications taken during flight were reported to be less effective than expected. Evaluation of series of experiments involving astronauts from shuttle flights shows notable individual variability to several pharmaceuticals during flight. These data provide reasonable assumption of perturbation in CYP450 enzymes during spaceflight, which contribute to the hepatic metabolism of the majority of drugs and therefore may have significant effects on therapeutic efficacy and increase treatment-related toxicity. The genes encoding the CYP450 enzymes are highly variable in humans. Inheritable variations of CYP450 hepatic metabolizer enzymes and transport proteins play a crucial role in the inter-individual variability of drug efficiency and risks of adverse drug reactions. Additionally, there are some reports that document changes in the levels of production of drug-metabolizing enzymes in microgravity. Therefore, in order to provide a safe and effective pharmaceutical treatment in space, medications selection should be based not only on the specific efficacy of medications but also on the individual drug sensitivity and flight-induced changes in metabolism of astronauts chosen for a particular mission. To our knowledge, there was no pre-flight drug sensitivity testing on a genetic level for any of the previous manned NASA space missions. Therefore, technologies capable of predicting and managing medication efficacy, side effects, and toxicity of drugs based on individual genetic variability of crew members are increasingly needed. In this report, we present results of testing the market available Personalized Prescribing System (PPS), a comprehensive, non-invasive solution for safer, targeted medication management for every crew member. Statistical accuracy and simplicity of non-invasive sample analysis demonstrate the feasibility of drug sensitivity assessment and record-keeping tool for flight surgeons and astronauts in applying the recommended medications for situations arising in flight. The information on individual drug sensitivity will translate into personalized risk assessment for adverse drug reactions and treatment failures for each drug from the medication kit as well as predefined outcome. This will address the HHC’s raised “Concern of Clinically Relevant Unpredicted Effects of Medication” as recently updated.

20100015381,ABSTRACT,Treadmill Exercise Within LBNP as an Integrated Coutermeasure to Microgravity,"[""Lee, Stuart"",""Hargens, A. R."",""Schneider, S. M."",""Watenpaugh, D. E.""]","An integrated exercise countermeasure for microgravity is needed to protect multiple physiologic systems and save crew time. Such a countermeasure should protect orthostatic tolerance, upright ambulatory capability (including sprinting), aerobic capacity, muscle strength/endurance, and other physiologic parameters relevant to human performance. We developed a novel physiologic countermeasure, treadmill exercise within LBNP, for preventing cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning associated with prolonged bed rest and spaceflight. We evaluated 40 min of daily LBNP treadmill exercise by a battery of physiologic parameters relevant to maintaining exercise performance and health of both women and men during bed-rest (simulated microgravity) studies lasting from 5 to 60 days. For 30 day studies, we employed identical twins with one twin as the control and the other twin as the exerciser to improve comparative power. During the WISE 60-day HDT study, the treadmill exercise within LBNP was performed 3-4 days each week and resistive exercise was performed 2-3 days each week. Our treadmill within LBNP protocol maintained plasma volume and sprint speed (30 day HDT bed-rest studies of identical twins), orthostatic tolerance to a degree, upright exercise capacity, muscle strength and endurance, and some bone parameters during 30 day (twin studies) and 60 day (WISE-2005) bed-rest simulations of microgravity. When combining treadmill exercise within LBNP and resistive exercise (WISE), cardiac mass increased significantly in the exercise (EX) group during bed rest relative to controls (CON). Upright peak VO2, and knee extensor strength and endurance decreased significantly in CON subjects; but these parameters were preserved in the EX group. In the 60 day WISE study, each LBNP exercise session was followed immediately by 10 minutes of static LBNP, and the last such session occurred three days before the end of bed rest. Still, orthostatic tolerance was better maintained in the EX group than in the CON group. Therefore, these collective peer-reviewed results document that our treadmill exercise within LBNP countermeasure safely and efficiently protects multiple physiologic systems in women and men during bed-rest studies of up to 60 days.

20210022922,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Method Development for In-situ Detection of Latent Herpesvirus DNA from Saliva using Nanopore Sequencing ,"[""Hang N Nguyen"",""Christian Castro"",""Audry Almengor"",""Sarah Stahl-Rommel"",""Satish Mehta"",""Brian Crucian"",""Sarah Castro-Wallace""]","Research toward latent herpesvirus reactivation has been intensively addressed through Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) investigations. This work has provided the understanding that persistent reactivation of herpesviruses from asymptomatic crew can be detected through viral shedding in saliva, urine, and blood. Occasionally, viral reactivation from the latency stage can pose a threat to crew health (clinical manifestation) before, during, and after flight missions. Furthermore, previous work detailing correlations with immunity indicate that monitoring viral reactivation could be implemented to assess potential immune dysfunction. While in-flight monitoring is desirable, there is no well-established procedure or method for real-time evaluations, and research to date has relied on postflight, ground-based analysis. 
The development of portable molecular technologies like the miniPCR™ (miniPCR Bio) thermal cycler and the MinION™ sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have confirmed that real-time monitoring is possible in extreme and low resource environments. These devices, combined with simple sample preparation methods, have been used to demonstrate bacterial identification onboard the ISS, as well as rapid viral detection in remote locations on Earth. The work here builds upon previous molecular advancements onboard the ISS toward the development and validation of a spaceflight-compatible method for viral detection from crew samples. 
Several herpesviruses can be detected in saliva, which provides a non-invasive means to collect samples for monitoring. While the basis for this method lies in previous spaceflight investigations, key points for method optimization include DNA extraction from saliva, viral primer selection, and bioinformatic processes for data analysis. To increase viral yield, numerous DNA extraction methods have been evaluated and will be discussed in detail. For initial development and testing, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is being targeted though open reading frame 51 and 63 (ORF51, ORF63), as the replication origin-binding protein is highly expressed during latency. Optimization of the thermal cycling parameters has resulted in the ability to test the entire process. The full method has been tested with both viral VZV DNA standards and saliva spiked with varying concentrations of VZV. Viral sequence data were mapped to the reference sequence using minimap2. Prior to mapping, DNA sequencing reads were filtered for length and quality, barcodes were removed, and alignment identity calculated. Following further assessments, statistics were compared across multiple sequencing experiments and are being used to determine the success of the protocols. Forward work will include the incorporation of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) primers as well as the validation of results to the terrestrial qPCR standard assay. Upon full validation of the developed method, saliva will be collected from 20 healthy subjects and spiked with viral DNA. These samples will be split and assayed with the MinION and standard qPCR assay.

20230001365,PRESENTATION,Preparation for an Earth Independent Medical Operations Demonstration using the Tempus ALS™ Medical Device,"[""Beth Lewandowski"",""Gail Perusek"",""Courtney Schkurko"",""Kimesha Calaway"",""Ben Easter"",""Rahul Suresh"",""Kris Lehnhardt"",""Moriah Thompson""]","NASA’s exploration-class missions have severe resource constraints, long return trip durations, significant communication delays and limited resupply opportunities. Validation on the International Space Station (ISS) of medical devices that fit within Earth-Independent Medical Operations (EIMO) systems is a necessary preparation step. Key features of an EIMO medical system include: 1) technologies that support the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of spaceflight medical events; 2) components that meet mass, volume, power and crew time/training constraints; 3) consideration of the medical skill level of the astronaut caregiver; 4) collection, storage and analysis of medical data within a central data architecture; and 5) incorporation of appropriate guidance and support tools that allow crew autonomy. The Human Research Program’s (HRP) Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element and the Exploration Medical Integrated Product Team (XM-IPT) are planning an ISS technology demonstration to determine the feasibility of including a multifunctional medical device into an EIMO medical system.

Demonstration Preparations: The Tempus ALS (Remote Diagnostic Technologies, Ltd., Philips Corp., Farnborough, UK) is a commercial-off-the-shelf medical device, with United States Food and Drug Administration clearance and is Conformité Européene marked in Europe. Several thousand units have been sold and are successfully operating in pre-hospital and in remote settings, such as by European Space Agency (ESA) flight surgeons and some of NASA’s commercial partners during post-flight medical operations. The Tempus ALS provides vital sign measurements such as blood pressure, electrocardiograms, heart rate, end tidal CO2, respiration rate, pulse oximetry and temperature. The device has ultrasound imaging and video laryngoscopy capabilities and has automatic or manual defibrillation modes for treating cardiac arrhythmias. It includes procedural guidance capabilities to assist in the collection of the vital sign measurements and it has various data transmission and report generation features.

NASA’s HRP ExMC and XM-IPT are partnering with the ESA to demonstrate the Tempus ALS on ISS, with ESA manifesting the Tempus ALS and its accessories. ESA will compare performance of periodic health status exams and medical contingency drills performed nominally and with the Tempus ALS. NASA’s EIMO demonstration will include the use of Tempus ALS to diagnose a complaint of abdominal pain under increasingly independent circumstances. The caregiver must assess the present illness, collect vital sign measurements, and perform an abdominal ultrasound, under one of three communication situations, including real-time, with a several second delay and with a delay on the order of minutes.

Expected Outcomes: Information will be gained about the feasibility, benefits, and challenges of using a multifunctional, all-in-one, medical device for medical diagnosis instead of separate devices with singular functionalities. Information will also be collected about performance differences as communication delays increase and available ground support decreases. Gaining this understanding will allow for further development of exploration medical system capabilities which takes the EIMO construct into consideration.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230001365,""endDate"":""2023-02-09T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""765cfc58ff374b8fac1523a2738739f9"",""id"":""8ec011d8d6b44cc6b873cb3c6e028b5a""}],""name"":""Human Research Program-Investigators Working Group (HRP-IWG) "",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""765cfc58ff374b8fac1523a2738739f9"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/08d8f955-514e-4e10-b860-bd009811ec13/summary"",""startDate"":""2023-02-07T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""305041""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230001365
20190033205,PRESENTATION,Simulated Weightlessness Alters Cardiomyocyte Structure and Transcriptional Regulation of Mediators Related to Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease,"[""Tahimic, Candice""]","Spaceflight and the ensuing fluid shifts, together with an overall reduction in physical activity, lead to acute and latent effects on the cardiovascular system. This current study makes use of the rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model to determine how factors such as sex, age, and duration of exposure impact cardiac responses to weightlessness. We hypothesize that extended exposure to simulated weightlessness and the ensuing recovery alters cardiac structure and expression of select genes, including those involved in redox signaling which together, negatively impact long-term cardiac tissue health. To begin to test this hypothesis, male and female rats underwent HU at various durations up to 90 days, with a subset reambulated after 90 days of HU. Physiological stress or contractility changes lead to alterations in ventricular cardiomyocyte size and ventricular wall thickness to adapt to greater functional demand and mitigate mechanical stress to ventricular tissue; under certain conditions, these changes also may mark progression to cardiac failure. Hence, left ventricular cardiomyocyte size (cardiomyocyte cross sectional area, CSA) was quantified to determine if HU leads to structural adaptation responses in cardiac tissue and if age and sex had any impact on this outcome. Cardiomyocyte CSA of older males (9 months) were altered by HU in a time-dependent manner, where HU led to decreases in CSA at 14 days and increases at 90 days. In contrast, younger males (3 months) did not show any changes at day 14 of HU. CSA of females (3 months) was increased in response to short-term HU (14 days) suggesting sex-dependence of structural changes. In older HU males, cardiomyocyte CSA was comparable to controls after 90 days of re-ambulation. Levels of the DNA oxidative damage marker, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were greater in left ventricular tissue of females that underwent HU compared to sex-matched controls, while there were no such differences in older or younger males. To gain insight into the signals that drive cardiac adaptations to HU, global transcriptomic analysis (RNAseq) was performed on left ventricular tissue of older males that underwent 14 days of HU. Short-term simulated weightlessness led to differential expression of genes involved in immune and pro-inflammatory signaling. A subset of these genes play a role in autoimmune and cardiovascular disease and are targets of current drugs used to treat bradycardia, hypertension, atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, amongst others. Oxidative damage/redox signaling pathways were not enriched at the timepoint tested in older males. Since young females displayed greater oxidative damage to DNA, activation of oxidative stress responses at earlier or later time points cannot be ruled out. In summary, simulated weightlessness in adult rats caused changes in cardiomyocyte structure in a sex and age-dependent manner, and the transcriptional regulation of key mediators of immunity and cardiovascular disease, meriting further study to define cardiac risks for interplanetary travel of human crew. Our findings also confirm the value of the rat HU model for cardiac health and countermeasure research.","[{""submissionId"":20190033205,""id"":""80ab63d4a36e40a98af8c6fc2ac66b80"",""publicationDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190033205,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""9642909abb7b4388b32449b111ec4571""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190033205,""endDate"":""2019-11-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f6412fb9905840a99c6c19356a3e09d1"",""id"":""b160d23441f2489ba8f26e5fd877c383""}],""name"":""ASGSR 2019"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""f6412fb9905840a99c6c19356a3e09d1"",""startDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190033205

J."",""Reuter-Lorenz, R. A."",""Kofman, I."",""Bloomberg, J. J."",""Mulavara, A. P."",""Ploutz-Snyder, L."",""Seidler, R. D.""]","Long duration spaceflight microgravity results in cephalad fluid shifts and deficits in posture control and locomotion. Effects of microgravity on sensorimotor function have been investigated on Earth using head down tilt bed rest (HDBR). HDBR serves as a spaceflight analogue because it mimics microgravity in body unloading and bodily fluid shifts. Preliminary results from our prior 70 days HDBR studies showed that HDBR is associated with focal gray matter (GM) changes and gait and balance deficits, as well as changes in brain functional connectivity. In consideration of the health and performance of crewmembers we investigated whether exercise reduces the effects of HDBR on GM, functional connectivity, and motor performance. Numerous studies have shown beneficial effects of exercise on brain health. We therefore hypothesized that an exercise intervention during HDBR could potentially mitigate the effects of HDBR on the central nervous system. Eighteen subjects were assessed before (12 and 7 days), during (7, 30, and ~70 days) and after (8 and 12 days) 70 days of 6-degrees HDBR at the NASA HDBR facility in UTMB, Galveston, TX, US. Each subject was randomly assigned to a control group or one of two exercise groups. Exercise consisted of daily supine exercise which started 20 days before the start of HDBR. The exercise subjects participated either in regular aerobic and resistance exercise (e.g. squat, heel raise, leg press, cycling and treadmill running), or aerobic and resistance exercise using a flywheel apparatus (rowing). Aerobic and resistance exercise intensity in both groups was similar, which is why we collapsed the two exercise groups for the current experiment. During each time point T1-weighted MRI scans and resting state functional connectivity scans were obtained using a 3T Siemens scanner. Focal changes over time in GM density were assessed using voxel based morphometry (VBM8) under SPM. Changes in resting state functional connectivity was assessed using both a region of interest (ROI, or seed-to-voxel) approach as well as a whole brain intrinsic connectivity (i.e., voxel-to-voxel) analysis. For the ROI analysis we selected 11 ROIs of brain regions that are involved in sensorimotor function (i.e., L. Insular C., L. Putamen, R. Premotor C., L.+R. Primary Motor C., R. Vestibular C., L. Posterior Cingulate G., R. Cerebellum Lobule V + VIIIb + Crus I, and the R. Superior Parietal G.) and correlated their time course of brain activation during rest with all other voxels in the brain. The whole brain connectivity analysis tests changes in the strength of the global connectivity pattern between each voxel and the rest of the brain. Functional mobility was assessed using an obstacle course. Vestibular contribution to balance was measured using Neurocom Sensory Organization Test 5. Behavioral measures were assessed pre-HDBR, and 0, 8 and 12 days post-HDBR. Linear mixed models were used to test for effects of time, group, and group-by-time interactions. Family-wise error corrected VBM revealed significantly larger increases in GM volume in the right primary motor cortex in bed rest control subjects than in bed rest exercise subjects. No other significant group by time interactions in gray matter changes with bed rest were observed. Functional connectivity MRI revealed that the increase in connectivity during bed rest of the left putamen with the bilateral midsagittal precunes and the right cingulate gyrus was larger in bed rest control subjects than in bed rest exercise subjects. Furthermore, the increase in functional connectivity with bed rest of the right premotor cortex with the right inferior frontal gyrus and the right primary motor cortex with the bilateral premotor cortex was smaller in bed rest control subjects than in bed rest exercise subjects. Functional mobility performance was less affected by HDBR in exercise subjects than in control subjects and post HDBR exercise subjects recovered faster than control subjects. The group performance differences and GM changes were not related. Exercise in HDBR partially mitigates the adverse effect of HDBR on functional mobility, particularly during the post-bed rest recovery phase. In addition, exercise appears to result in differential brain structural and functional changes in motor regions such as the primary motor cortex, the premotor cortex and the putamen. Whether these central nervous system changes are related to motor behavioral changes including gait and balance warrants further research.","[{""submissionId"":20150023268,""id"":""24aca939ca4a45a8a67722ec5d4bebba"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150023268,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""c8b9c8878305449c82713d629b26fe23"",""id"":""cafc01d0082e4698a872e873e2dba039""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""c8b9c8878305449c82713d629b26fe23"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150023268

DAP provides expertise and computation tools to its research customers for model development, integration, or analysis. DAP is currently supporting the NASA Exercise Physiology and Countermeasures (ExPC) project by integrating their biomechanical models of specific exercise movements with dynamic models of the devices on which the exercises were performed. This presentation focuses on the development of a high fidelity dynamic module of the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) on board the ISS. The ARED module, illustrated in the figure below, was developed using the Adams (MSC Santa Ana, California) simulation package. The Adams package provides the capabilities to perform multi rigid body, flexible body, and mixed dynamic analyses of complex mechanisms. These capabilities were applied to accurately simulate: Inertial and mass properties of the device such as the vibration isolation system (VIS) effects and other ARED components, Non-linear joint friction effects, The gas law dynamics of the vacuum cylinders and VIS components using custom written differential state equations, The ARED flywheel dynamics, including torque limiting clutch. Design data from the JSC ARED Engineering team was utilized in developing the model. This included solid modeling geometry files, component/system specifications, engineering reports and available data sets. The Adams ARED module is importable into LifeMOD (Life Modeler, Inc., San Clemente, CA) for biomechanical analyses of different resistive exercises such as squat and dead-lift. Using motion capture data from ground test subjects, the ExPC developed biomechanical exercise models in LifeMOD. The Adams ARED device module was then integrated with the exercise subject model into one integrated dynamic model. This presentation will describe the development of the Adams ARED module including its capabilities, limitations, and assumptions.

20060013130,ABSTRACT,Comprehensive Astronaut Immune Assessment Following a Short-Duration Space Flight,"[""Crucian, Brian"",""Stowe, Raymond"",""Yetman, Deborah"",""Pierson, Duane"",""Sams, Clarence""]","Immune system dysregulation has been demonstrated to occur during spaceflight and has the potential to cause serious health risks to crewmembers participating in exploration class missions. As a part of an ongoing NASA flight experiment assessing viral immunity (DSO-500), a generalized immune assessment was performed on 3 crewmembers who participated in the recent STS-114 Space Shuttle mission. The following assays were performed: (1) comprehensive immunophenotype analysis; (2) T cell function/intracellular cytokine profiles; (4) secreted Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles via cytometric bead array. Immunophenotype analysis included a leukocyte differential, lymphocyte subsets, T cell subsets, cytotoxic/effector CD8+ T cells, memory/naive T cell subsets and constitutively activated T cells. Study timepoints were L-180, L-65, L-10, R+0, R+3 and R+14. Detailed data are presented in the poster text. As expected from a limited number of human subjects, data tended to vary with respect to most parameters. Specific post-flight alterations were as follows (subject number in parentheses): Granulocytosis (2/3), reduced NK cells (3/3), elevated CD4/CD8 ratio (3/3), general CD8+ phenotype shift to a less differentiated phenotype (3/3), elevated levels of memory CD4+ T cells (3/3), loss of L-selectin on T cell subsets (3/3), increased levels of activated T cells (2/3), reduced IL-2 producing T cell subsets (3/3), levels of IFNg producing T cells were unchanged. CD8+ T cell expression of the CD69 activation markers following whole blood stimulation with SEA+SEB were dramatically reduced postflight (3/3), whereas other T cell function assessments were largely unchanged. Cytometric bead array assessment of secreted T cell cytokines was performed, following whole blood stimulation with either CD3/CD28 antibodies or PMA+ionomycin for 48 hours. Specific cytokines assessed were IFNg, TNFa, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10. Following CD3/CD28 stimulation, all three crewmembers had a mission-associated reduction in the levels of secreted IFNg. One crewmember had a post-flight inversion in the IFNg/IL-10 ratio postflight, which trended back to baseline by R+14. Detailed cytokine data are presented in the poster text. This testing regimen was designed to correlate immunophenotype changes (thought to correspond to specific in-vivo immune responses or pathogenesis), against altered leukocyte function and cytokine profiles. In-flight studies are required to determine if post-flight alterations are reflective of the in-flight condition, or are a response to landing and readaptation.","[{""submissionId"":20060013130,""id"":""25ac4ad2a9164e8b8c9bd3a3e214b321"",""publicationDate"":""2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Canada"",""submissionId"":20060013130,""endDate"":""2006-05-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""ISAC International Congress"",""location"":""Quebec"",""id"":""d73521d9218f4cad9e636bf8e4b3e185"",""startDate"":""2006-05-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20060013130
20230003916,POSTER,Astronaut Sleep Duration Varies by Timing of Scheduled Sleep,"[""Erin E. Flynn-Evans"",""Zachary L. Glaros"",""Rachel A. Jansen""]","INTRODUCTION: Studies find that humans average approximately six hours of sleep per night in space, which is less than they sleep on Earth. Such short sleep duration has been associated with reduced alertness and performance in space. It is unclear whether this sleep loss is related to modifiable factors, such as irregular scheduling, poor sleep environment, and excessive workload or due to features of spaceflight that alter physiology (e.g., microgravity). Recent missions have afforded crew better, more stable sleep and work schedules, and an improved sleep environment. Despite these improvements, schedules do still vary enough to cause decrements in sleep duration.  

METHODS: Crewmembers (n = 19) who volunteered for the NASA Standard Measures protocol between January 2019 and March 2022 were provided with actiwatches (Phillips, Respironics, Bend OR) that they wore for two bouts of data collection lasting two weeks each before flight (at approximately L-270 and L-180), either continuously (n = 9) or for two weeks every two months while in space (n = 10), and for seven days postflight, immediately upon return to Earth (R+0). A regularly scheduled (or “nominal”) sleep episode would take place between the hours of 9:30pm and 6:00am. We looked at sleep outcomes (sleep duration, wake after sleep onset [WASO], sleep efficiency) depending on the distance from nominal sleep offset to see whether scheduled sleep period affected sleep durations and other metrics of sleep quality.

RESULTS: Crewmembers provided data from 402 nights preflight, 2,137 nights inflight, and 275 nights postflight. They averaged 7.33 hours of sleep per night (± 1.16, SD) in space. Though this was significantly less sleep than they achieved preflight (7.87 ± 1.10) or postflight (7.75 ± 1.43, p < .01), this duration of sleep meets the recommended amount for optimal human health and well-being. For every hour after the nominal sleep period a crewmember woke up, their total sleep increased by 25 minutes (up to 5 hours). 
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that humans are capable of achieving sufficient sleep in space, especially when their schedules afford adequate sleep (namely, schedules that phase delay rather than advance). Future studies are needed to determine whether microgravity impacts sleep architecture and sleep quality. Going forward, it is imperative that crewmembers are provided with stable schedules, with moderate workload, and environments that are conducive to sleep.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230003916,""endDate"":""2023-05-26T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association""}},""meetingId"":""e87107d78577444896d680729b97ecf7"",""id"":""3ff2d4bfe2b74399a8a6488cb0737be3""}],""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA) 2023 Conference"",""location"":""New Orleans, LA"",""id"":""e87107d78577444896d680729b97ecf7"",""url"":""https://www.asma.org/scientific-meetings/asma-annual-scientific-meeting/future-annual-meetings"",""startDate"":""2023-05-21T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""340428.02.30.01.01""]",undefined,"[""Space Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230003916

For upcoming exploration missions, the need for enhanced medical care becomes critical due to extended mission durations, significant communication delays, and minimal evacuation opportunities. Previous evidence by our team has revealed that among the 119 medical conditions targeted for management during spaceflight within NASA Exploration Medical Capability’s IMPACT Condition List, at least 36 could benefit from radiography (XR). Utilizing XR for diagnosis and management is hypothesized to significantly improve management of crew health by enabling the immediate evaluation and confirmation of potential injuries or illnesses. Beyond clinical applications, XR also holds potential for non-destructive testing (NDT). This includes applications such as assessing the structural integrity of the spacecraft, analyzing surface and meteorite samples, and inspecting onboard electronics.

<b>THREE CANDIDATE X-RAY SYSTEMS CHOSEN FOR GROUND DEMONSTRATION</b>
The Exploration Medical Capability Element (ExMC) and the Exploration Medical Integrated Product Team (XMIPT) of the Mars Campaign Office initiated early background work for ground demonstrations. In FY21, ExMC published a Concept of Operations to guide requirements development. By FY23, XMIPT and yet2, a technology scouting and open innovation consulting firm, had completed a market survey and trade study to identify potential miniature XR systems. Selection criteria included commercial-off-the-shelf availability, low mass and volume, and regulatory compliance. The top three candidate devices—Remedi REMEX-KA6, MinXray Impact, and FujiFilm Xair—were acquired to characterize the requirements and capabilities of each device. To facilitate testing, phantoms, and radiographic personal protective equipment (PPE) were purchased, and a dedicated space was designated for XRS usage at Glenn Research Center. During this presentation, the mass, volume, and power requirements for each of the three piloted devices are revealed, as well as information regarding the detector, mA, and kV of the devices. 

<b>GOAL AND OBJECTIVES OF A MINI XRS GROUND DEMONSTRATION</b>
The primary goal of ExMC/XMIPT technology demonstrations is to bridge the gap in available, flight-ready medical device technology by flight-testing diagnostic and treatment technologies essential for managing medical conditions during exploration missions. These technologies must adhere to vehicle constraints such as mass, volume, power, and data requirements, integrate seamlessly with medical decision-support tools, and support increasingly Earth-independent operations. There are three main objectives for the future ground demonstration of these three devices. First, we aim to determine the full capabilities of these three miniature XR systems within the context of the spaceflight environment. While medical applications are the primary focus for the miniature XR, a comprehensive exploration of non-medical uses has been initiated by an XMIPT-sponsored NASA SPARK campaign to identify collaborators. Second, we plan to establish criteria and to use insights gained from evaluating each miniature XR against those criteria to select the most suitable system among the three candidates. Third, we intend to evaluate their suitability for flight certification, which includes assessing its durability for launch, reentry, and exposure to high background radiation, as well as its compatibility with existing data architecture systems. Numerous subject matter experts from NASA and partner institutions will support these objectives.","[{""submissionId"":20240012179,""publisher"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""id"":""677124d35d5c4665b4e68cc77b22e669"",""publicationDate"":""2025-01-28T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240012179,""endDate"":""2025-01-31T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ffd887b0c760409a9027cf86ed3cead5"",""id"":""0570b5046eb14c15a999d9359e393076""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""ffd887b0c760409a9027cf86ed3cead5"",""startDate"":""2025-01-28T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B"",""80GRC020D0003""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240012179
20150021777,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Effects of Acute Exposures to Carbon Dioxide Upon Cognitive Functions,"[""Scully, R. R."",""Alexander, D. J."",""Ryder, V. E."",""Lam, C. W."",""Statish, U."",""Basner, M.""]","Large quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) originate from human metabolism and typically, within spacecraft, remain about 10-fold higher in concentration than at the earth's surface. There have been recurring complaints by crew members of episodes of ""mental viscosity"" adversely affecting their performance, and there is evidence from the International Space Station (ISS) that associates CO2 levels with reports of headaches by crewmembers. Additionally, there is concern that CO2 may contribute to vision impairment and intracranial pressure that has been observed in some crewmembers. Consequently, flight rules have been employed to control the level of CO2 below 4 mm Hg, which is well below the existing Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentration (SMAC) of 10 mm Hg for 24-hour exposures, and 5.3 mm Hg for exposures of 7 to 180 days. However, the flight rule imposed limit, which places additional demands upon resources and current technology, still exceeds the lower bound of the threshold range for reportable headaches (2 - 5 mm Hg). Headaches, while sometime debilitating themselves, are also symptoms that can provide evidence that physiological defense mechanisms have been breached. The causes of the headaches may elicit other subtle adverse effects that occur at CO2 levels well below that for headaches. The concern that CO2 may have effects at levels below the threshold for headaches appears to be substantiated in unexpected findings that CO2 at concentrations below 2 mm Hg substantially reduced some cognitive functions that are associated with the ability to make complex decisions in conditions that are characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity, and delayed feedback. These are conditions that could be encountered by crews in off-nominal situations or during the first missions beyond low earth orbit. If findings of the earlier study are confirmed in crew-like subjects, our findings would provide additional evidence that CO2 may need to be controlled at levels that are well below current spacecraft limits. Our study will extend the earlier study to determine if crew-like subjects are similarly effected by CO2. In addition to employing the Strategic Management Simulation tool, we will use the Cognition battery of psychometric measures that are being utilized aboard the ISS. It will be important to learn, by using Cognition, if additional cognitive domains are sensitive to concentrations of CO2 at or below limits currently controlled by flight rules. While spaceflight Cognition data will greatly enhance the knowledge base related to inflight behavioral health and performance, some of the measures may be influenced by fatigue (related to sleep deprivation and or workload) and changes in circadian rhythms. Therefore our use of this battery of tests in a well-controlled, ground-based study that is free of these potential confounding influences will establish a baseline terrestrial data set against which Cognition data collected in flight may be assessed. The findings from this study will be useful to the NASA Toxicology Office and the National Research Council Committee on Toxicology, which assists NASA in setting environmental standards, for revision of the SMAC for CO2, and for designing further studies on effects of CO2 upon cognitive functions.","[{""submissionId"":20150021777,""id"":""4512cd61c9d0443cae3170780d20a1cd"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150021777,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6051cfdb3bc04daaadb3cce31e265882"",""id"":""70de98b74afe4e89ada383f2739dd514""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""6051cfdb3bc04daaadb3cce31e265882"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150021777
20220018390,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Safety Culture at the World’s Premier Multi-User Spaceport,"[""Larrin E. Moody""]","NASA’s Agency-wide Safety Culture is implemented at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) using a unique strategy due an unparalleled approach in making human spaceflight history. Kennedy Space Center, the world’s premier multi-user spaceport, enables U.S. government and commercial space access, while providing the world a resource to allow the exploration of and the ability to work in space. A consistently healthy safety culture at KSC is imperative for mission success: desired achievements, protection of space flight hardware, and ultimately, the preservation of human life requires the support of a healthy safety culture.  

Emphasis on the NASA Agency-wide development of Safety Culture began with the conception of the NASA Agency Safety Culture Working Group. After the devastating loss of life and mission of the Space Shuttle Colombia, a broken safety culture was identified as an organizational cause by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board Report. Thus, the Agency Safety Culture Working Group was developed in 2009 to assess the status of the Agency’s Safety Culture, while addressing safety culture concerns at the NASA Center-level. A Five-factor model was developed to serve as the guiding principles for Safety Culture: 1) Reporting Culture, 2) Just Culture, 3) Flexible Culture, 4) Learning Culture, and 5) Engaged Culture. These five factors are included in the NASA Safety Culture logo, which was intentionally designed as a DNA double helix to prompt the permeation of safety into day-to-day work.  

KSC specifically implements the NASA Agency-wide Safety Culture principles in a tailored approach that is relevant to the diversity of work being performed. An emphasis is placed on the implementation to include safety at home, not exclusively at work. This emphasis is a KSC-specific element that has been intentionally added to promote a closed loop Safety Culture.
 
To advertise the safety culture, various safety and health events are held throughout the calendar year, providing innovative speakers and engaging activities, while also promoting a wide range of curated safety initiatives. Development and continuous improvement of the KSC safety tracking database, allows for advanced tracking-to-closure, along with providing data sets used to identify areas of emphasis.  Other safety initiatives rely solely on employee participation, such as the photo challenges; participants are encouraged to identify and capture themselves, coworkers, or family members participating in safe or healthy activities to share with others within the Center and at Agency levels. Fabrication of exclusive videos and graphics are utilized to advertise and inform employee of safety initiatives, upcoming safety events, and general dispersion of safety information. In addition, an anonymous Agency-wide Safety Culture Survey is advertised, administered, and analyzed at Kennedy Space Center, with the purpose of receiving basic feedback on Safety Culture perceptions to help prevent future incidents from occurring.  

Through these briefly identified means, and many other forms of employee engagement, Kennedy Space Center aims to maintain safety in the forefront, while creating an environment where everyone trusts that safety is a priority.

20140003854,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Focal Gray Matter Plasticity as a Function of Long Duration Head Down Tilted Bed Rest: Preliminary Results,"[""Koppelmans, V."",""Erdeniz, B."",""DeDios, Y. E."",""Wood, S. J."",""Reuter-Lorenz, P. A."",""Kofman, I."",""Bloomberg, J. J."",""Mulavara, A. P."",""Seidler, R. D.""]","Long duration spaceflight (i.e., 22 days or longer) has been associated with changes in sensorimotor systems, resulting in difficulties that astronauts experience with posture control, locomotion, and manual control. The microgravity environment is an important causal factor for spaceflight induced sensorimotor changes. Whether these sensorimotor changes are solely related to peripheral changes from reduced vestibular stimulation, body unloading, body fluid shifts or that they may be related to structural and functional brain changes is yet unknown. However, a recent study reported associations between microgravity and flattening of the posterior eye globe and protrusion of the optic nerve [1] possibly as the result of increased intracranial pressure due to microgravity induced bodily fluid shifts [3]. Moreover, elevated intracranial pressure has been related to white matter microstructural damage [2]. Thus, it is possible that spaceflight may affect brain structure and thereby cognitive functioning. Long duration head down tilt bed rest has been suggested as an exclusionary analog to study microgravity effects on the sensorimotor system [4]. Bed rest mimics microgravity in body unloading and bodily fluid shifts. In consideration of the health and performance of crewmembers both in- and post-flight, we are conducting a prospective longitudinal 70-day bed rest study as an analog to investigate the effects of microgravity on brain structure [5]. Here we present results of the first six subjects. Six subjects were assessed at 12 and 7 days before-, at 7, 30, and ~70 days in-, and at 8 and 12 days post 70 days of bed rest at the NASA bed rest facility in UTMB, Galveston, TX, USA. At each time point structural MRI scans (i.e., high resolution T1-weighted imaging and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)) were obtained using a 3T Siemens scanner. Focal changes over time in gray matter density were assessed using the voxel based morphometry 8 (VBM8) toolbox under SPM. Longitudinal processing in VBM8 includes linear registration of each scan to the mean of the subject and subsequently transforming all scans in to MNI space by applying the warp from the mean subject to MNI to the individual gray matter segmentations. Modulation was applied so that all images represented the volume of the original structure in native space. Voxel wise analysis was carried out on the gray matter images after smoothing, using a flexible factorial design with family wise error correction. Focal changes in white matter microstructural integrity were assessed using tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) as part of FMRIB software library (FSL). TBSS registers all DTI scans to standard space. It subsequently creates a study specific white matter skeleton of the major white matter tracts. For each subject, for each DTI metric (i.e. fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD)), the maximum value in a line perpendicular to the skeleton tract is projected to the skeleton. Non-parametric permutation based t-tests and ANOVA's were used for voxel-wise comparison of the skeletons. For both VBM and TBSS, comparison of pre bed rest measurements did not show significant differences. VBM analysis revealed decreased gray matter density in bilateral areas including the frontal medial cortex, the insular cortex and the caudate (see Figure) from 'pre to in bed rest'. Over the same time period, there was an increase in gray matter density in the cerebellum, occipital-, and parietal cortex, including the precuneus (see Figure). The majority of these changes did not recover from 'during to post bed rest'. TBSS analysis did not reveal significant changes in white matter microstructural integrity after correction for multiple comparisons. Uncorrected analyses (p<.015) revealed an increase in RD in the cerebellum and brainstem from pre bed rest to the first week in bed rest that did not recover post bed rest. Extended bed rest, which is an analog for microgravity, can result in gray matter changes and potentially in microstructural white matter changes in areas that are important for neuro motor behavior and cognition. These changes did not recover at two weeks post bed rest. Whether the effects of bed rest wear off at longer times post bed rest, and if they are associated with behavior are important questions that warrant further research.

R."",""Zapp, N."",""Barber, R. E."",""Wilson, J. W."",""Qualls, G."",""Toupes, L."",""Ramsey, S."",""Vinci, V."",""Smith, G."",""Cucinotta, F. A.""]","With 5-7 month long duration missions at 51.6 degrees inclination in Low Earth Orbit, the ionizing radiation levels to which International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers are exposed will be the highest planned occupational exposures in the world. Even with the expectation that regulatory dose limits will not be exceeded during a single tour of duty aboard the ISS, the ""as low as reasonably achievable"" (ALARA) precept requires that radiological risks be minimized when possible through a dose optimization process. Judicious placement of efficient shielding materials in locations where crewmembers sleep, rest, or work is an important means for implementing ALARA for spaceflight. Polyethylene (CnHn) is a relatively inexpensive, stable, and, with a low atomic number, an effective shielding material that has been certified for use aboard the ISS. Several designs for placement of slabs or walls of polyethylene have been evaluated for radiation exposure reduction in the Crew Quarters (CQ) of the Zvezda (Star) Service Module. Optimization of shield designs relies on accurate characterization of the expected primary and secondary particle environment and modeling of the predicted radiobiological responses of critical organs and tissues. Results of the studies shown herein indicate that 20% or more reduction in equivalent dose to the CQ occupant is achievable. These results suggest that shielding design and risk analysis are necessary measures for reducing long-term radiological risks to ISS inhabitants and for meeting legal ALARA requirements. Verification of shield concepts requires results from specific designs to be compared with onboard dosimetry. c2004 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

20150000242,TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM,Influence of Combined Whole-Body Vibration Plus G-Loading on Visual Performance,"[""Adelstein, Bernard D."",""Beutter, Brent Robert"",""Kaiser, Mary K."",""McCann, Robert S."",""Stone, Leland S."",""Anderson, Mark R."",""Renema, Fritz"",""Paloski, William H.""]","Recent engineering analyses of the integrated Ares-Orion stack show that vibration levels for Orion crews have the potential to be much higher than those experienced in Gemini, Apollo, and Shuttle vehicles. Of particular concern to the Constellation Program (CxP) is the 12 Hz thrust oscillation (TO) that the Ares-I rocket develops during the final ~20 seconds preceding first-stage separation, at maximum G-loading. While the structural-dynamic mitigations being considered can assure that vibration due to TO is reduced to below the CxP crew health limit, it remains to be determined how far below this limit vibration must be reduced to enable effective crew performance during launch. Moreover, this ""performance"" vibration limit will inform the operations concepts (and crew-system interface designs) for this critical phase of flight. While Gemini and Apollo studies provide preliminary guidance, the data supporting the historical limits were obtained using less advanced interface technologies and very different operations concepts. In this study, supported by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) Human Research Program, we investigated display readability-a fundamental prerequisite for any interaction with electronic crew-vehicle interfaces-while observers were subjected to 12 Hz vibration superimposed on the 3.8 G loading expected for the TO period of ascent. Two age-matched groups of participants (16 general population and 13 Crew Office) performed a numerical display reading task while undergoing sustained 3.8 G loading and whole-body vibration at 0, 0.15, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 g in the eyeballs in/out (x-axis) direction. The time-constrained reading task used an Orion-like display with 10- and 14-pt non-proportional sans-serif fonts, and was designed to emulate the visual acquisition and processing essential for crew system monitoring. Compared to the no-vibration baseline, we found no significant effect of vibration at 0.15 and 0.3 g on task error rates (ER) or response times (RT). Significant degradations in both ER and RT, however, were observed at 0.5 and 0.7 g for 10-pt, and at 0.7 g for 14-pt font displays. These objective performance measures were mirrored by participants' subjective ratings. Interestingly, we found that the impact of vibration on ER increased with distance from the center of the display, but only for vertical displacements. Furthermore, no significant ER or RT aftereffects were detected immediately following vibration, regardless of amplitude. Lastly, given that our reading task required no specialized spaceflight expertise, our finding that effects were not statistically distinct between our two groups is not surprising. The results from this empirical study provide initial guidance for evaluating the display readability trade-space between text-font size and vibration amplitude. However, the outcome of this work should be considered preliminary in nature for a number of reasons: 1. The single 12 Hz x-axis vibration employed was based on earlier load-cycle models of the induced TO environment at the end of Ares-I first stage flight.

20170009912,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Differences in Pre and Post Vascular Patterning of Retinas from ISS Crew Members and HDT Subjects by VESGEN Analysis,"[""Murray, M. C."",""Vizzeri, G."",""Taibbi, G."",""Mason, S. S."",""Young, M. H."",""Zanello, S. B."",""Parsons-Wingerter, P. A.""]","Accelerated research by NASA [1] has investigated the significant risks for visual and ocular impairments Spaceflight Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome /Visual Impairment/Intracranial Pressure (SANS/VIIP) incurred by microgravity spaceflight, especially long-duration missions. Our study investigates the role of blood vessels in the incidence and etiology of SANS/VIIP within the retinas of Astronaut crewmembers pre-and post-flight to the International Space Station (ISS) by NASA's VESsel GENeration Analysis (VESGEN). The response of retinal vessels in crewmembers to microgravity was compared to that of retinal vessels to Head-Down Tilt (HDT) in subjects undergoing 70-Day Bed Rest. The study tests the proposed hypothesis that cephalad fluid shifts missions, resulting in ocular and visual impairments, are necessarily mediated in part by retinal blood vessels, and are therefore accompanied by significant remodeling of retinal vasculature.Vascular patterns in the retinas of crew members and HDTBR subjects extracted from 30° infrared (IR) Heidelberg Spectralis® images collected pre/postflight and pre/post HDTBR, respectively, were analyzed by VESGEN (patent pending). a mature, automated software developed as a research discovery tool for progressive vascular diseases in the retina and other tissues [2]. The weighted, multi-parametric VESGEN analysis generates maps of branching arterial and venous trees and quantification by parameters such as the fractal dimension (Df, a modern measure of vascular space-filling capacity), vessel diameters, and densities of vessel length and number classified into specific branching generations by vascular physiological branching rules [2,3]. The retrospective study approved by NASA’s Institutional Review Board included six HDT subjects (NASA Flight Analogs Research Unit [FARU] Campaign 11; for example, [4]) and eight ISS crewmembers monitored by routine occupational surveillance who provided their study consents to NASA’s Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health (LSAH). For the initial blinded VESGEN phase, ophthalmic retinal images were masked as to subject identity and pre- and post-status. In the second unblinded phase, VESGEN results were analyzed according to the pre- and post-status of left and right retinas matched to each subject. To complete our study, vascular results will be subjected to NASA biostatistical analysis and correlated with other ophthalmic and medical findings. Preliminary results for changes in the pre- to post-status of vascular patterning in the retinas of crewmembers and HDT subjects are strikingly opposite. By Df and other vascular branching measures, the space-filling capacity of arterial and venous trees decreased in a substantial subset of crewmembers (11/16 retinas). In contrast, vascular densities increased in a substantial subset of HDT subjects by the same parameters (6/10 retinas, currently excluding one anomalous subject). To conclude the study, biostatistical and medical analyses will be of critical importance for investigating the validity of these vascular findings. Vascular densities appeared to decrease in the retinas of crewmembers following ISS Missions, and increase in subjects after HDT. The vascular increases and decreases most likely derive primarily from limits of resolution to the ophthalmic imaging that does not capture the smallest vessels, rather than from vessel growth or atrophy. Differences in arterial and venous response to cephalad fluid shifts induced by ISS and HDT may have resulted from a long-duration conditioning phenomenon (for example, 6-month ISS missions compared to 70-day HDT), or the presence of gravity in HDT compared to microgravity onboard the ISS. To conclude our study, the biostatistical and medical analyses will be of critical importance for investigating the validity and significance of the VESGEN findings.","[{""submissionId"":20170009912,""id"":""12bcd3b24f46471d8d12b5d8ee84d103"",""publicationDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170009912,""endDate"":""2018-01-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""3303db6f4fca49978c8e2a7b13a3c3d0"",""id"":""8a22bc9e534e498e8479fe8e1128db7c""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2018)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""3303db6f4fca49978c8e2a7b13a3c3d0"",""startDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170009912

D.""]","Bed rest has been widely used as a simulation of weightlessness in studying the effects of microgravity exposure on human physiology and cognition. Changes in muscle function and functional mobility have been reported to be associated with bed rest. Understanding the effect of bed rest on neural control of movement would provide helpful information for spaceflight. In the current study, we evaluated how the brain activation for foot movement changed as a function of bed rest. Eighteen healthy men (aged 25 to 39 years) participated in this HDBR study. They remained continuously in the 6deg head‐down tilt position for 70 days. Functional MRI was acquired during 1‐Hz right foot tapping, and repeated at 7 time points: 12 days pre‐, 8 days pre‐, 7 days in‐, 50 days in‐, 70 days in‐, 8 days post‐, and 12 days post‐ HDBR. In all 7 sessions, we observed increased activation in the left motor cortex, right cerebellum and right occipital cortex during foot movement blocks compared to rest. Compared to the pre‐HDBR baseline (1st and 2nd sessions), foot movement‐induced activation in the left hippocampus increased during HDBR. This increase emerged in the 4th session, enlarged in the 5th session, and remained significant in the 6th and 7th sessions. Furthermore, increased activation relative to the baseline in left precuneus was observed in the 5th, 6th and 7th sessions. In addition, in comparison with baseline, increased activation in the left cerebellum was found in the 4th and 5th sessions, whereas increased activation in the right cerebellum was observed in the 4th, 6th and 7th sessions. No brain region exhibited decreased activation during bed rest compared to baseline. The increase of foot movement related brain activation during HDBR suggests that in a long‐term head‐down position, more neural control is needed to accomplish foot movements. This change required a couple of weeks to develop in HDBR (between 3rd and 4th sessions), and did not return to baseline even 12 days after HDBR. The observed effect of bed rest on brain activation during a foot tapping task could be linked to HDBR related changes in brain structure that we have recently reported. The relationship between pre‐ and post‐ HDBR changes in brain activation and performance in a functional mobility test will also be presented.","[{""submissionId"":20150003000,""id"":""5df8a77c575b4acfad7d1ad7bdf9a7c6"",""publicationDate"":""2015-04-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150003000,""name"":""Neural Control of Movement"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""a102e8f399954b1cae8be3b6d3474b04""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150003000,""endDate"":""2015-04-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Neural Control of Movement"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""0ccf933935514a74bac8c3007c95092c"",""id"":""795755c3595c429b9bb20bbbca5f1e8c""}],""name"":""Annual Conference of the Society for the Neural Control of Movement"",""location"":""Charleston, SC"",""id"":""0ccf933935514a74bac8c3007c95092c"",""startDate"":""2015-04-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""1UL1RR029876?01"",""NNX11AR02G"",""NCC 9-58""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150003000
20000029495,OTHER,Sustained Partial Sleep Deprivation: Effects on Immune Modulation and Growth Factors,"[""Mullington, Janet M.""]","The vulnerability to medical emergencies is greatest in space where there are real limits to the availability or effectiveness of ground based assistance. Moreover, astronaut safety and health maintenance will be of increasing importance as we venture out into space for extended periods of time. It is therefore critical to understand the mechanisms of the regulatory physiology of homeostatic systems (sleep, circadian, neuroendocrine, fluid and nutritional balance) and the key roles played in adaptation. This synergy project has combined aims of the ""Human Performance Factors, Sleep and Chronobiology Team""; the ""Immunology, Infection and Hematology Team""; and the ""Muscle Alterations and Atrophy Team"", to broadly address the effects of long term sleep reduction, as is frequently encountered in space exploration, on neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and circulating growth factors. Astronaut sleep is frequently curtailed to averages of between 4- 6.5 hours per night. There is evidence that this amount of sleep is inadequate for maintaining optimal daytime functioning. However, there is a lack of information concerning the effects of chronic sleep restriction, or reduction, on regulatory physiology in general, and there have been no controlled studies of the cumulative effects of chronic sleep reduction on neuroendocrine and neuroimmune parameters. This synergy project represents a pilot study designed to characterize the effects of chronic partial sleep deprivation (PSD) on neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and growth factors. This project draws its subjects from two (of 18) conditions of the larger NSBRI project, ""Countermeasures to Neurobehavioral Deficits from Cumulative Partial Sleep Deprivation During Space Flight"", one of the projects on the ""Human Performance Factors, Sleep and Chronobiology Team "". For the purposes of this study, to investigate the effects of chronic sleep loss on neuroendocrine and neuroimmune function, we have focused on the two extreme sleep conditions from this larger study: a 4.2 hour per night condition, and a 8.2 hour per night condition. During space flight, muscle mass and bone density are reduced, apparently due to loss of GH and IGF-I, associated with microgravity. Since >70% of growth hormone (GH) is secreted at night in normal adults, we hypothesized that the chronic sleep restriction to 4 hours per night would reduce GH levels as measured in the periphery. In this synergy project, in collaboration with the ""Muscle Alterations and Atrophy Team "", we are measuring insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in peripheral circulation to test the prediction that it will be reduced by chronic sleep restriction. In addition to stress modulation of immune function, recent research suggests that sleep is also involved. While we all have the common experience of being sleepy when suffering from infection, and being susceptible to infection when not getting enough sleep, the mechanisms involved in this process are not understood and until recently have gone largely overlooked. We believe that the immune function changes seen in spaceflight may also be related to the cumulative effects of sleep loss. Moreover, in space flight, the possibility of compromised immune function or of the reactivation of latent viruses are serious potential hazards for the success of long term missions. Confined living conditions, reduced sleep, altered diet and stress are all factors that may compromise immune function, thereby increasing the risks of developing and transmitting disease. Medical complications, which would not pose serious problems on earth, may be disastrous if they emerged in space.","[{""submissionId"":20000029495,""id"":""0663d0035a9e4dfea1e9008af1f489f1"",""publicationName"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute"",""publicationDate"":""1999-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""},{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000029495

E."",""Gadd, N."",""Taylor, L."",""Peters, B. T."",""Allen, E."",""Reschke, M. F."",""Bloomberg, J. J."",""Mulavara, A. P.""]","Microgravity exposure results in an adaptive central reinterpretation of information from multiple sensory sources to produce a sensorimotor state appropriate for motor actions in this unique environment, but this new adaptive state is no longer appropriate for the 1-g gravitational environment on Earth. During these gravitational transitions, astronauts experience deficits in both perceptual and motor functions including impaired postural control, disruption in spatial orientation, impaired control of locomotion that include alterations in muscle activation variability, modified lower limb kinematics, alterations in head-trunk coordination as well as reduced dynamic visual acuity. Post-flight changes in postural and locomotor control might have adverse consequences if a rapid egress was required following a long-duration mission, where support personnel may not be available to aid crewmembers. The act of emergency egress includes, but is not limited to standing, walking, climbing a ladder, jumping down, monitoring displays, actuating discrete controls, operating auxiliary equipment, and communicating with Mission Control and recovery teams while maintaining spatial orientation, mobility and postural stability in order to escape safely. The average time to recover impaired postural control and functional mobility to preflight levels of performance has been shown to be approximately two weeks after long-duration spaceflight. The postflight alterations are due in part to central reinterpretation of vestibular information caused by exposure to microgravity. In this study we will use a commonly used technique of transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied across the vestibular end organs (galvanic vestibular stimulation, GVS) to disrupt vestibular function as a simulation of post-flight disturbances. The goal of this project is an engineering human-in-the-loop evaluation of a device that can degrade performance of functional tasks (e.g. to maintain upright balance) similar to what astronauts experience during transitions to new gravitational environments. Stochastic electrical stimulation can be applied to the vestibular system through electrodes placed over the mastoid process behind the ears in the binaural configuration resulting in stimulation in the mediolateral (side-to-side) plane. An additional electrode can be placed over the bony landmark of the tip of the c7 spinous process for the double monaural configuration, which will cause stimulation in the anteroposterior (forward-backward) plane. A portable constant current bipolar stimulator with subject isolation was designed and built to deliver the stimulus. The unit is powered using a 3.7 V battery pack and designed to produce currents up to 5 mA. The stimulator, controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3 computer, offers several stimulus signal generation options including a standalone mode, which uses onboard signal files stored on the flash memory card. Stochastic stimulation signals will be generated in 0-30 Hz frequency bandwidth. Stimulation amplitude can be increased incrementally to a maximum amplitude of 5.0 mA (e.g., 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 mA). In control trials, subjects will be experiencing vestibular stimulation with 0-mA current applied through the electrodes. The system will be evaluated at various levels of stimulation and in both the binaural and double monaural electrode configurations. One of the objectives is to identify stimulation levels producing effects most comparable to the post-flight disturbances. This is a pilot study that will set the stage for a larger, more comprehensive study that will investigate wider aspects of post-flight sensorimotor dysfunction and set sensorimotor standards for crew health.","[{""submissionId"":20160013701,""id"":""da7ad66e4e3140959acf9263ca1d2f09"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160013701,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""c4745ff0b4844f8ab6ee38c7f51d81d5""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160013701,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""df64c3d626ad4382a3bd0c3a0aa8f963"",""id"":""c39c3d8aaf564645a055e52c41b61db6""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2017)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""df64c3d626ad4382a3bd0c3a0aa8f963"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Computer Programming And Software""]","[{""id"":20170001373,""title"":""Evaluation of Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation System""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160013701
20150002716,PRESENTATION,Probabilistic Risk Assessment for Astronaut Post Flight Bone Fracture,"[""Lewandowski, Beth"",""Myers, Jerry"",""Licata, Angelo""]","Introduction: Space flight potentially reduces the loading that bone can resist before fracture. This reduction in bone integrity may result from a combination of factors, the most common reported as reduction in astronaut BMD. Although evaluating the condition of bones continues to be a critical aspect of understanding space flight fracture risk, defining the loading regime, whether on earth, in microgravity, or in reduced gravity on a planetary surface, remains a significant component of estimating the fracture risks to astronauts. This presentation summarizes the concepts, development, and application of NASA's Bone Fracture Risk Module (BFxRM) to understanding pre-, post, and in mission astronaut bone fracture risk. The overview includes an assessment of contributing factors utilized in the BFxRM and illustrates how new information, such as biomechanics of space suit design or better understanding of post flight activities may influence astronaut fracture risk. Opportunities for the bone mineral research community to contribute to future model development are also discussed.  Methods: To investigate the conditions in which spaceflight induced changes to bone plays a critical role in post-flight fracture probability, we implement a modified version of the NASA Bone Fracture Risk Model (BFxRM). Modifications included incorporation of variations in physiological characteristics, post-flight recovery rate, and variations in lateral fall conditions within the probabilistic simulation parameter space. The modeled fracture probability estimates for different loading scenarios at preflight and at 0 and 365 days post-flight time periods are compared. Results: For simple lateral side falls, mean post-flight fracture probability is elevated over mean preflight fracture probability due to spaceflight induced BMD loss and is not fully recovered at 365 days post-flight. In the case of more energetic falls, such as from elevated heights or with the addition of lateral movement, the contribution of space flight quality changes is much less clear, indicating more granular assessments, such as Finite Element modeling, may be needed to further assess the risks in these scenarios.","[{""submissionId"":20150002716,""id"":""5154388f5e6147668e10db46d46ed3ac"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150002716,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""f8c2473b1e5a4afab7daf7e0a968cc98""},{""submissionId"":20150002716,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""2cc4b089ebeb4c35823dfb34680d1127""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150002716,""endDate"":""2015-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""efd739244af345e98812a14c608a1222"",""id"":""dda7d8f1461d42128c20b6589b1802a5""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""efd739244af345e98812a14c608a1222"",""id"":""76e764fa1398418b80ef120cbd1537d2""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop Integrated Pathways to Mars"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""efd739244af345e98812a14c608a1222"",""startDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150002716,""endDate"":""2015-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""88fab09ddd594fb98805fcd08eeaf349"",""id"":""588f261b72814f54b56085776053ee38""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""88fab09ddd594fb98805fcd08eeaf349"",""id"":""37cf98b1279340dca807edbfb08ce7c8""}],""name"":""Space Radiation Investigators'' Workshop and Behavioral Health and Performance Working Group"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""88fab09ddd594fb98805fcd08eeaf349"",""startDate"":""2015-01-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 444543.01.02.10""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Statistics And Probability""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150002716

Schkurko"",""K. M. Calaway"",""R. S. Miller"",""B. D. Easter"",""R. Suresh"",""K. R. Lehnhardt"",""M. S. Thompson""]","INTRODUCTION TO MIM DEVICES
Multi-functional Integrated Medical (MIM) devices conveniently incorporate multiple medical system capabilities within one device. The NASA Exploration Medical Integrated Product Team (XM-IPT) sponsored a market survey and trade study which identified the Tempus ProTM and the LifeBot 10® as the MIM devices that best met the evaluation criteria of the trade study. The Tempus ProTM (Remote Diagnostic Technologies, Ltd., Philips Corp., Farnborough, UK) and LifeBot 10® (LifeBot Health, Chicago, IL) both provide vital sign measurements such as blood pressure, electrocardiograms, heart rate, end tidal CO2, respiration rate, pulse oximetry and temperature along with ultrasound imaging. A video laryngoscopy capability is unique to the Tempus ProTM, while the LifeBot 10® supports connectivity with a digital stethoscope, otoscope, eye exam camera, and dermatoscope. Both devices include procedural guidance capabilities and have various data transmission and report generation features. 

TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATIONS
NASA’s exploration-class missions will have severe resource constraints, long return trip durations, significant communication delays, and limited resupply opportunities. The medical systems of these missions will need to fit within an Earth-Independent Medical Operations (EIMO) construct. Key features of an EIMO medical system include: 1) technologies that support the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of spaceflight medical events; 2) components that meet mass, volume, power and crew time/training constraints; 3) consideration of the medical skill level of the astronaut caregiver; 4) collection, storage and analysis of medical data within a central data architecture; and 5) incorporation of appropriate guidance and support tools that allow crew autonomy. Evaluations are underway to determine if it will be beneficial to include MIM devices within exploration medical systems by conducting a series of planned technical demonstrations. Exploration Atmosphere Chamber studies are being performed to determine MIM functionality in a high oxygen concentration atmosphere. A side-by-side comparison of the Tempus ProTM and LifeBot 10® will be performed during ground-based demonstrations. Use of the MIM devices within an EIMO medical scenario simulation will be practiced during ground-based demonstrations in preparation for International Space Station (ISS) demonstrations of the MIM device. These various demonstrations are designed to gather evidence for or against the inclusion of MIM devices within an EIMO medical system.

EXPECTED DEMONSTRATION OUTCOMES
Information will be gained about the feasibility, benefits, and challenges of using a multifunctional, all-in-one, medical device for medical diagnosis. Information will also be collected about performance differences as available ground support decreases. Gaining this understanding will allow for further development of exploration medical system capabilities, which take the EIMO construct into consideration.

Bone markers, calcitropic hormones, and calcium kinetics of crew members on space missions of 4-6 months were evaluated. Spaceflight-induced bone loss was associated with increased bone resorption and decreased calcium absorption. INTRODUCTION: Bone loss is a significant concern for the health of astronauts on long-duration missions. Defining the time course and mechanism of these changes will aid in developing means to counteract these losses during space flight and will have relevance for other clinical situations that impair weight-bearing activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report here results from two studies conducted during the Shuttle-Mir Science Program. Study 1 was an evaluation of bone and calcium biochemical markers of 13 subjects before and after long-duration (4-6 months) space missions. In study 2, stable calcium isotopes were used to evaluate calcium metabolism in six subjects before, during, and after flight. Relationships between measures of bone turnover, biochemical markers, and calcium kinetics were examined. RESULTS: Pre- and postflight study results confirmed that, after landing, bone resorption was increased, as indicated by increases in urinary calcium (p < 0.05) and collagen cross-links (N-telopeptide, pyridinoline, and deoxypyridinoline were all increased >55% above preflight levels, p < 0.001). Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D metabolites were unchanged at landing. Biochemical markers of bone formation were unchanged at landing, but 2-3 weeks later, both bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin were significantly (p < 0.01) increased above preflight levels. In studies conducted during flight, bone resorption markers were also significantly higher than before flight. The calcium kinetic data also validated that bone resorption was increased during flight compared with preflight values (668 +/- 130 versus 427 +/- 153 mg/day; p < 0.001) and clearly documented that true intestinal calcium absorption was significantly lower during flight compared with preflight values (233 +/- 87 versus 460 +/- 47 mg/day; p < 0.01). Weightlessness had a detrimental effect on the balance in bone turnover such that the daily difference in calcium retention during flight compared with preflight values approached 300 mg/day (-234 +/- 102 versus 63 +/- 75 mg/day; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These bone marker and calcium kinetic studies indicated that the bone loss that occurs during space flight is a consequence of increased bone resorption and decreased intestinal calcium absorption.","[{""volume"":""20"",""submissionId"":20050184836,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0884-0431"",""id"":""c088bf67985346fd81fa2d4216e69d7f"",""publicationName"":""Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research"",""publicationDate"":""2005-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050184836
20230014016,PRESENTATION,Functional Task Tests in Partial Gravity During Parabolic Flight,"[""T R Macaulay"",""A Bollinger"",""S J Wood"",""M F Reschke"",""G R Clement""]","BACKGROUND
Understanding how critical mission tasks are performed in partial gravity such as on the moon or Mars is necessary to define effective and comprehensive countermeasure strategies for preserving crew performance during exploration missions. We studied the performance of tasks such as standing, walking, and jumping during the partial gravity phases of parabolic flight. We hypothesized that the acute effects of partial gravity on vestibular, proprioceptive, and sensorimotor functions would negatively impact performance.

 METHODS
Twelve subjects were tested over three flights of 30 parabolas each, including 10 parabolas at 0.25g, 10 parabolas at 0.5g, and 10 parabolas at 0.75g. Subjects also performed tests in 1g between parabolas. During the sit-to-stand with obstacle walk task, subjects rose from a seated position and walked as quickly as possible straight ahead towards a cone (4 m distance), walked around the cone making a 180° left turn, returned, and sat in the chair. On the way to and from the cone, subjects stepped over a 30 cm high obstacle. For the recovery from fall task, subjects lay prone for the pull-up phase and initial 10 sec of the parabola. Then they were asked to rise as quickly as possible and maintain a quiet stance for 10 sec. The tandem rail balance task involved standing with both feet on a 4.5 cm wide rail. The time ended when subjects either stepped off the rail or grabbed on to support straps. The jump down task started with the subjects standing on a 30 cm high platform, then the subjects were instructed to step off the platform, land with both feet simultaneously, and settle in a quiet stance. The cone of stability task involved subjects leaning about the ankles as far as they could in the anterior, posterior, and lateral directions without unfolding their arms or taking a step. The center of pressure distance between endpoints was calculated. Data were collected using inertial measurement units (Opal V2, APDM, Portland, OR) worn on the head and trunk, heart rate monitors (RS800CX, Polar, Kempele, Finland), and a force plate (Bertec, Columbus, OH). 

RESULTS
Gravity level had a significant effect on performance, with the greatest changes from 1g tending to be at the 0.25g level (Table 1). Lower gravity levels were associated with increased times to complete the sit-to-stand obstacle walk task and the recovery from fall task, decreased change in heart rate during the recovery from fall task, decreased rail balance times, and increased cone of stability distance in the anterior-posterior direction.

DISCUSSION
These data suggest that there is a dose-response relationship between gravity level and functional task performance. The largest changes in performance were expected at the lowest gravity level (0.25g) because subjects would no longer be able to use the gravitational reference for the perception of upright. Understanding the extent of performance deficits informs the risks and design of countermeasures for exploration spaceflight missions.

20150021488,ABSTRACT,Influence of Exercise Modality on Cerebral-Ocular Hemodynamics and Pressures,"[""Scott, J."",""Martin, D."",""Crowell, B."",""Goetchius, E."",""Seponski, C."",""Gonzales, R."",""Matz, T."",""Ploutz-Snyder, R."",""Stenger, M."",""Ploutz-Snyder, L.""]","Background: Moderate and high intensity aerobic or resistance exercise has clearly identified benefits for cardiac, muscle, and bone health. However, the impact of such exercise - either as a mitigating or an exacerbating factor - on the development of the visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome (VIIP) is unknown. Accordingly, our aim was to characterize the effect of an acute bout of resistance (RE), moderate-intensity continuous (CE), and high-intensity interval exercise (IE) during a cephalad fluid shift on cerebral-ocular hemodynamics and pressures. Methods: 10 male subjects (36 plus or minus 9 years) completed 4 testing days in a 15 degree head-down tilt (HDT): (1) assessment of maximum volume of O (sub 2), (2) RE session (4 sets of 12 repetition maximum leg press exercise), (3) CE session (30 minutes of cycling at 60 percent maximum volume of O (sub 2)), and (4) IE session (4 by 4-minute intervals of exercise at 85 percent maximum volume of O (sub 2) with 3-minute active rest periods). During each session, blood flow (Vivid-e, GE Healthcare) in extracranial arteries (common carotid artery, CCA; internal carotid artery, ICA; external carotid artery, ECA and vertebral artery, VA), and mean blood flow velocity in middle cerebral artery (MCA), internal jugular pressure (IJP; VeinPress), and intraocular pressure (IOP; Icare PRO) were measured at rest, at the end of each resistance or interval set, and every 5 minutes during continuous exercise. Translaminar pressure gradient (TLPG) was estimated by subtracting IJP from IOP. Results: There were no differences across days in pre-exercise resting blood flows or pressures. IOP decreased slightly from HDT rest (20.2 plus or minus 2.3 millimeters of mercury) to exercise (RE: 19.2 plus or minus 2.8 millimeters of mercury; CE: 18.9 plus or minus 3.2 millimeters of mercury; IE: 20.1 plus or minus 2.8 millimeters of mercury), while IJP decreased during CE (31.6 plus or minus 9.5 millimeters of mercury) and RE (32.0 plus or minus 8.1 millimeters of mercury), and increased during IE (35.1 plus or minus 9.5 millimeters of mercury) from HDT rest (33.3 plus or minus 6.5 millimeters of mercury). Estimated TLPG was increased during IE only. Compared to RE and CE, IE resulted in the greatest increase in MCA blood flow velocity and extracranial artery blood flow. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that high-intensity IE acutely increases cerebral blood flow, IJP, and TLPG.

20220014862,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Operational Implications from Field Test Results: Sensorimotor Guidelines for Exploration Missions,"[""S J Wood"",""S C Moudy"",""M J Rosenberg"",""I S Kofman"",""E S Tomilovskaya"",""M F Reschke""]","Two key sensorimotor objectives of the joint NASA-Russian Field Test (FT) study were (1) to quantify functional performance on long duration crewmembers as close to landing as possible, and (2) to develop a recovery timeline back to preflight baseline. The purpose of this presentation is to provide an overview of the FT results and discuss the operational implications for future exploration missions. The NASA and Russian teams conducted a total of 48 Field Tests, including 18 using a reduced Pilot FT (PFT) protocol. The combined PFT/FT cohort included 14 first-time fliers, 4F, and nine cosmonauts who repeated FT during a second mission. The mission durations were 185 ± 42 days, mean ± std. Nominally, the initial postflight session was performed in the medical test at the Soyuz landing site or at the nearby airport (R+2.2 ± 1.3 hrs, mean ± std), and then repeated multiple times throughout the postflight recovery. The common tasks performed across PFT and full FT protocols included sit-to-stand, recovery from fall (prone to stand) and tandem walk, performed in that order of increasing difficulty. The full FT protocol also included seated tasks (eccentric gaze, dysmetria finger to nose, eye-hand coordination on a tablet, grip force discrimination), a standing posture test with an upper body perturbation, a timed up and go mobility test with obstacles, and a dynamic visual acuity task during vertical oscillations. While there was considerable variability in the postflight outcome measures across crewmembers, the level of vestibular/cerebellar and sensorimotor impairment was greater than previously observed during shorter spaceflight missions. Most striking was the higher incidence of motion sickness even without constraining the standard medical interventions. Motion sensitivity prevented some crewmembers from attempting and/or completing the early testing. The recovery timeline varied with task complexity, generally taking longer when either the basis of support was limited (e.g., tandem walk) or visual cues were deprived (eyes closed). Based on this evidence, mission planners need to expect a range of response across individuals and tasks following G-transitions. Individual health assessments are recommended along with development of pre-worked, prioritized content and timelines, with the ability to change roles depending on crew readiness. Handholds and balance aids are recommended to help stabilize the crewmembers to perform specific tasks (e.g., touch screen selection) or to allow the crewmember the ability to rest with onset of symptoms. Based on anecdotal reports and performance on computerized dynamic posturography, multiple testing on landing day appeared to be beneficial for some participants, while others may have pushed beyond their motion tolerance limit in an effort to complete more FT objectives. Instead of delaying planetary surface operations to allow for recovery, our results suggest that early mobility may be important. Early active self-administered retraining, individualized based on the level of initial impairment and motion sensitivity, will enable a more efficient motor learning and enhance crew performance.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220014862,""endDate"":""2023-02-09T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""1f73bf164379476382a7a2e48069b4ac"",""id"":""341ebe03f7c24d8ebc4cf99a05a36676""}],""name"":""2023 NASA's Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""1f73bf164379476382a7a2e48069b4ac"",""url"":""https://www.cvent.com/c/abstracts/6c66b149-d763-4180-aed9-784f2773e5be"",""startDate"":""2023-02-07T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""012566.01.04.10""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220014862
20160013631,ABSTRACT,Gradient Compression Garments as a Countermeasure to Post-Space Flight Orthostatic Intolerance: Potential Interactions with the Maximum Absorbency Garment,"[""Lee, S. M. C."",""Laurie, S. S."",""Macias, B. R."",""Willig, M."",""Johnson, K."",""Stenger, M. B.""]","Astronauts and cosmonauts may experience symptoms of orthostatic intolerance during re-entry, landing, and for several days post-landing following short- and long-duration spaceflight. Presyncopal symptoms have been documented in approximately 20% of short-duration and greater than 60% of long-duration flyers on landing day specifically during 5-10 min of controlled (no countermeasures employed at the time of testing) stand tests or 80 deg head-up tilt tests. Current operational countermeasures to orthostatic intolerance include fluid loading prior to and whole body cooling during re-entry as well as compression garments that are worn during and for up to several days after landing. While both NASA and the Russian space program have utilized compression garments to protect astronauts and cosmonauts traveling on their respective vehicles, a ""next-generation"" gradient compression garment (GCG) has been developed and tested in collaboration with a commercial partner to support future space flight missions. Unlike previous compression garments used operationally by NASA that provide a single level of compression across only the calves, thighs, and lower abdomen, the GCG provides continuous coverage from the feet to below the pectoral muscles in a gradient fashion (from approximately 55 mm Hg at the feet to approximately 16 mmHg across the abdomen). The efficacy of the GCG has been demonstrated previously after a 14-d bed rest study without other countermeasures and after short-duration Space Shuttle missions. Currently the GCG is being tested during a stand test following long-duration missions (~6 months) to the International Space Station. While results to date have been promising, interactions of the GCG with other space suit components have not been examined. Specifically, it is unknown whether wearing the GCG over NASA's Maximum Absorbency Garment (MAG; absorbent briefs worn for the collection of urine and feces while suited during re-entry and landing) will interfere with the effectiveness of the GCG or conversely whether the GCG will reduce the fluid absorption capabilities of the MAG. Methods: This operational, directed study, will (1) determine whether the effectiveness of the GCG is affected by the MAG with regard to cardiovascular responses to head-up tilt, the standard orthostatic intolerance test employed for astronauts and bed rest subjects; (2) determine whether the effectiveness of the MAG is compromised by the GCG tested by injecting a standard fluid volume (950 ml in 3 separate simulated ""urine voids"") at a standardized rate (30 ml/sec); and (3) determine whether comfort is affected by wearing the MAG under the GCG using a standardized questionnaire. Results from this study will guide future development and operational use of the GCG and MAG to maximize crew health, safety, and comfort.","[{""submissionId"":20160013631,""id"":""f57cb559a76d400ab398c23d44475e9a"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160013631,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""78490012aae84a908d11a8d791a29bdf""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160013631,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""5e263e09d52345b492a05638c1dcf696"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst.

20240010741,ABSTRACT,Unobtrusive Monitoring of Sensorimotor Performance in Ground-Based Functional Tasks ,"[""H Weiss"",""S Wood""]","Astronauts returning from long-duration exposure to microgravity frequently exhibit alterations in sensorimotor function leading to postural imbalance, impaired locomotion, and operational challenges to manual control. Mission duration often influences the severity of performance decrements, however individual responses vary as manifested by diverse adaptation timelines. Postflight disruptions during functional tasks are often detected through body-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) devices. While IMU sensors are relatively compact, the long-term wear may lead to discomfort, displacement of the sensors on the body, and restrictions in movement or crew behavior. Although IMU data offers valuable insights from a research standpoint, interpreting changes in pre- and post-flight measures can be difficult for crew support personnel beyond the research domain, which can hinder the application to medical assessments and rehabilitation. Finally, the availability of inertial sensors in-flight is limited. There is a need for unobtrusive monitoring tools to improve our ability to monitor adaptation following gravitational transitions in various postflight evaluations and rehabilitation settings. Markerless motion capture is an evolving unobtrusive technology that builds upon decades of research with marker-based motion capture systems to provide three-dimensional human pose estimation from multiple synchronized two-dimensional camera views using deep learning algorithms. Markerless technology can revolutionize how data is captured pre- and post-flight and potentially in-flight during intravehicular activity by enabling pose estimation of multiple crew members from onboard camera hardware. The following paper presents the initial evaluation of a state-of-the-art commercial-off-the-shelf markerless motion capture system, Theia Markerless, compared to traditional IMU devices during various ground-based functional tasks and environmental conditions. Synchronous functional data collected using both motion capture and IMUs are analyzed for six subjects, four male and two female subjects of varying anthropometry. The analysis includes limited assessments of clothing, capture volumes, and the tool's sensitivity to detecting performance changes after a spaceflight analog centrifuge exposure. Results demonstrate comparable root mean square error to existing literature comparing markerless and marker-based motion capture systems. The development of visualization tools to enhance the application of the pose estimation output is also presented.  These tools offer effective methods for anonymizing sensitive crew data, facilitating numerous applications across research, medical, and rehabilitation groups. The following work lays the foundation for future implementation leveraging markerless motion capture to assess the time course of recovery to baseline performance and provide insight for rehabilitation protocols to enhance crew readiness for the resumption of daily activities.","[{""submissionId"":20240010741,""id"":""6b1d1f2f91c14e3e90a410c350069a5e"",""publicationName"":""""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240010741,""endDate"":""2025-03-08T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""Reston, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6c00b317417f4f51b6bdb70be613dddc"",""id"":""584513173f704e1da5df5314e15f420d""},{""organizationId"":""8af3236884f245a5bac7fc9648e4475a"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Prognostics and Health Management Society"",""location"":""Nashville, TN""}},""meetingId"":""6c00b317417f4f51b6bdb70be613dddc"",""id"":""574b4d4657d24dc8856893c03887f71c""},{""organizationId"":""c89d4cba478b520a8c47b5bcac2f6911"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"",""location"":""Piscataway, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6c00b317417f4f51b6bdb70be613dddc"",""id"":""1b5c1fcb7ac24665a00e6663408f5245""}],""name"":""46th International IEEE Aerospace Conference "",""location"":""Big Sky, MT"",""id"":""6c00b317417f4f51b6bdb70be613dddc"",""url"":""https://www.aeroconf.org/"",""startDate"":""2025-03-01T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.03.01.33.2162"",""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20240012833,""title"":""Unobtrusive Monitoring of Sensorimotor Performance in Ground-Based Functional Tasks""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240010741

20150020967,ABSTRACT,Compiling a Comprehensive EVA Training Dataset for NASA Astronauts,"[""Laughlin, M. S."",""Murray, J. D."",""Lee, L. R."",""Wear, M. L."",""Van Baalen, M.""]","Training for a spacewalk or extravehicular activity (EVA) is considered a hazardous duty for NASA astronauts. This places astronauts at risk for decompression sickness as well as various musculoskeletal disorders from working in the spacesuit. As a result, the operational and research communities over the years have requested access to EVA training data to supplement their studies. The purpose of this paper is to document the comprehensive EVA training data set that was compiled from multiple sources by the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health (LSAH) epidemiologists to investigate musculoskeletal injuries. The EVA training dataset does not contain any medical data, rather it only documents when EVA training was performed, by whom and other details about the session. The first activities practicing EVA maneuvers in water were performed at the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator (NBS) at the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. This facility opened in 1967 and was used for EVA training until the early Space Shuttle program days. Although several photographs show astronauts performing EVA training in the NBS, records detailing who performed the training and the frequency of training are unavailable. Paper training records were stored within the NBS after it was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1985 and closed in 1997, but significant resources would be needed to identify and secure these records, and at this time LSAH has not pursued acquisition of these early training records. Training in the NBS decreased when the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, opened the Weightless Environment Training Facility (WETF) in 1980. Early training records from the WETF consist of 11 hand-written dive logbooks compiled by individual workers that were digitized at the request of LSAH. The WETF was integral in the training for Space Shuttle EVAs until its closure in 1998. The Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) at the Sonny Carter Training Facility near JSC opened in March 1997 and is the current site for US EVA training. Other space agencies also have used water to simulate weightlessness and train for EVAs. Russia has a training facility similar to the NBL named the Hydro Lab. The Hydro Lab began operations at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) in 1980 and has been used extensively to the present. Although a majority of training in the Hydro Lab uses the Russian Orlan suit, a small number of sessions have been conducted using a NASA suit. The Japanese Weightlessness Environment Test System (WETS) went into service at the Tsukuba Space Center in 1997 but was closed in 2011 due to extensive earthquake damage. Several sessions were performed using a NASA suit, but these sessions were short and considered ""development"" runs. LSAH has assembled records from the WETF, NBL and Hydro Lab. Recording of the EVA training data has changed considerably from 1967 to present. The goal of early record keeping was to track use of hardware components, and the person involved was treated as a suited operator, not as a focus of interest. Records from the past two decades are fairly precise with the person, date, suit type and size noted. On occasion the length of the session was listed, but this data is not included on all records. Records were merged from data sources and extensive cleaning of the records was required since the multiple sources frequently overlapped and duplicated records.  To date the LSAH EVA training dataset includes over 12,500 EVA training sessions performed by NASA astronauts since 1981. The following variables are included for most records: Name, Sex, Event date, Event name, HUT type, HUT size, Facility, and Estimated run time. For a smaller subset of records, the following variables are available: Actual run time, Time inverted, and the suit components Waist bearing type, Shoulder harness, Shoulder pads, and Teflon inserts. The LSAH dataset is currently the most complete resource for data regarding EVA training sessions performed by NASA astronauts. However, it is not 100 percent complete since the WETS (Japan) and NBS (Marshall) training facility data were not included.

20000020485,CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS,Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop,undefined,"The First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop, held January 11-13, 1999, was unique in that it assembled, for the first time, a broad cross section of NASA-funded biomedical researchers to present the current status of their projects and their plans for future investigations. All principal investigators with active, or recently-completed ground-based projects in NASA's Biomedical Research and Countermeasures Program that were funded through NASA's Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications were invited. Included were individual investigators funded through NASA Research Announcements, investigators with NASA Specialized Centers of Research and Training, investigators with the recently established National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI), and NASA civil servant investigators. Seventy-seven percent of all eligible projects were presented at the workshop. Thus, these Proceedings should provide a useful snapshot of the status of NASA-funded space biomedical research as of January 1999. An important workshop objective was to achieve free and open communication among the presenting investigators. Therefore, presentation of new and incomplete results, as well as hypotheses and ideas for future research, was encouraged. Comments and constructive criticisms from the presenters' colleagues were also encouraged. These ground rules resulted in many lively and useful discussions, during both the presentation sessions and informal evening gatherings and breaks.","[{""submissionId"":20000020485,""id"":""65c70d9d95fc4c00b3e9b88575264673"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators'
