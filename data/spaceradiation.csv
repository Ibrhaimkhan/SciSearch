20210018870,PRESENTATION,New developments in space radiation research at NASA: Annotating data using a novel radiation biology ontology,"[""Jack Miller"",""Paul N. Schofield"",""Luke T. Slater"",""Sylvain V. Costes"",""Daniel C Berrios""]","Like many interdisciplinary sciences, data producers and consumers in the field of radiation biology often use a wide variety of terminology to describe their experiments and data.  Furthermore, space systems and technologies are rapidly evolving, and a shared understanding and common terminology for these is also lacking.  The efficiency of research organizations can be enhanced by standardizing metadata through the use of knowledge resources like ontologies. Employing a sophisticated model such as a formal ontology to standardize metadata enables automated data acquisition processes and supports more complete, accurate meta-analysis through more efficient and complete data discovery and retrieval, particularly when using multiple data sources.  Thus, we developed the Radiation Biology Ontology (RBO) in order to improved radiation biology metadata uniformity and transparency.  We used open-source software (the Ontology Development Kit, Protégé and WebProtégé) and worked within the OBO Foundry framework, which includes a set of ontology development principles and practices for ontology consistency, uniformity, and accountability.  The RBO has now been incorporated into two radiation research data repositories, NASA’s GeneLab omics database (https://genelab.nasa.gov), and the European Commission STORE database (https://www.storedb.org/).  Continuous build integration tools allowed our international RBO collaboration to be more efficient and focus its efforts on semantic model design. Currently, the RBO contains over 300 annotated classes and individuals specific to the study of radiation on biological systems, as well as imports of many additional classes from other OBO Foundry ontologies that relate to and/or provide context for these RBO entities. We publish the RBO through the OBO Foundry, so that it is available for browsing, download, and querying through NCBI Bioportal web site and application programming interface. The NASA Ames Life Science Data Archive (ALSDA) is also in the process of adopting use of the RBO, taking NASA one step closer to a knowledge-based system for space biology data.     It is our hope that the global communities of radiation research Investigators, data curators and data analysts can similarly leverage the RBO and will contribute to its further development.",[],"[{""country"":""PR"",""submissionId"":20210018870,""endDate"":""2021-10-09T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""426499858bfb5eeebee9bd0b63129b00"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Bozeman, Montana, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9b3308fff29b45baa6a3869d5d10cec8"",""id"":""26cb96f7c6f74b64b6e57e8a2067be68""}],""name"":""Radiation Research Society's 67th Annual Meeting"",""location"":""San Juan"",""id"":""9b3308fff29b45baa6a3869d5d10cec8"",""url"":""https://na.eventscloud.com/website/23992/rrs21home/"",""startDate"":""2021-10-03T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210018870

20230012405,POSTER,Biological Space Radiation Countermeasures to Enable Long Duration Exploration Missions,"[""Brock J Sishc"",""Janice A Zawaski"",""Janapriya Saha"",""Gregory G Nelson"",""S Robin Elgart""]","NASA’s career radiation limit for astronauts is 600 mSv. Currently planned missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) will expose crew to at least double that amount of radiation (for Mars missions). Therefore, to enable long duration exploration, countermeasures need to be deployed to reduce the long-term health outcomes of space radiation exposure. Limitations to the ability of spacecraft to shield against the high energy charged particles of the space radiation environment necessitate alternative methods to reduce overall space radiation risk for carcinogenesis. Recent successes in the arenas of Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) and clinical radiotherapy have demonstrated the efficacy of compound-based/biologicals in reducing the detrimental long term health outcomes associated with space radiation exposure. In recent years, the Space Radiation Element has funded the investigation of several such compounds including Avasopasem Manganese, CDDO-Me, Metformin, and γ-tocotrienol. The demonstrated efficacy of these compounds in reducing carcinogenesis, central nervous system, and cardiovascular disease risks demonstrate the need for, and potential benefit of, a robust countermeasure identification and development program with an initial starting suite of compounds available to validate others. The authors would also like to present highlights of a recent Space Radiation Element sponsored issue of Life Sciences in Space Research entitled “Breaking the Limit” on this specific topic.

RadLab consists of a database, a submission portal, and user-friendly visualization and data analysis tools, including a graphical user interface (GUI) and an application programming interface (API). 

Investigators from ISS partners including Germany, Italy, Canada, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Russia, Japan have committed to providing data from their instruments. RadLab will also include data from other spacecraft in LEO: the Space Shuttle, the Mir space station, biosatellites; and beyond LEO: the lunar and the Martian surface, the heliocentric orbit at 1 AU, Mars orbit, and Earth-Mars space. 

Once fully operational, RadLab will provide open, centralized access to space radiation physics data relevant to human space exploration; a platform for submission of data by agencies and research institutions responsible for radiation detectors deployed in space; analysis tools to facilitate detector and dataset intercomparison to better understand space habitat radiation environments; capabilities for space biology investigators to determine the radiation environment to which samples were exposed.

A RadLab Working Group (RLWG) has been formed, modeled on the GeneLab Analysis Working Groups and comprised of data contributors and users. RLWG tasks include identifying data sources, normalizing data from diverse detectors, expanding the analysis toolkit and, perhaps most importantly, sharing ideas for research exploiting capabilities of RadLab.

We will provide an overview of RadLab data and capabilities and discuss examples of its potential as a resource for open science.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240002605,""endDate"":""2024-05-02T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""e1892323169842beabddce80dd3c74b5"",""id"":""baaf33c603af44e093bc194fcb490019""}],""name"":""Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) Analysis Working Group (AWG) Symposium 2024"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""e1892323169842beabddce80dd3c74b5"",""startDate"":""2024-05-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.06.01.02.01.02"",""80NSSC18M0060"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240002605

20220000484,POSTER,INCREASING THE TRANSPARENCY AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF SPACE RADIATION SCIENCE: THE RADIATION BIOLOGY ONTOLOGY,"[""D C Berrios"",""J Miller"",""P N Schofield"",""L T Slater"",""S V Costes""]","Among the primary objectives of the Open/Open-Source Science paradigm are making scientific investigation data transparent and results reproducible [1], objectives shared by the FAIR principles [2]. To accomplish this, the conceptual framework that includes all the investigation objects needs to be accurately captured and communicated to all data consumers. A large part of this requires using metadata standards to annotate data collected. These standards should be readily accessible, informed by scientific community consensus and sufficiently specific to encompass all of the important aspects of the investigation. Starting in 2020 we have been co-leading an open consortium to develop a new metadata standard, the Radiation Biology Ontology (RBO), through the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry [3]. We began by transforming many of the terms from the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement into concepts that can be formally related to existing OBO Foundry classes or attributes. We then identified and imported into the RBO existing OBO Foundry classes that have obvious relevance for radiation biomedicine (for example, concepts from the Environment Ontology that describe radiative processes, and concepts from the Gene Ontology dealing with molecular and cellular responses to radiation). Finally, we scrutinized datasets from investigations of radiation effects held in NASA GeneLab and LSDA repositories and added additional classes, instances, and attributes into the RBO that should be used to annotate these data. We developed the RBO using the open-source tools of GitHub and publish the RBO periodically through the NIH/NCBI BioPortal website, so systems worldwide can leverage the knowledge it contains [4]. This initial phase of concept modeling has yielded an RBO that at present has more than 300 declared concepts, with more than 3500 additional concepts imported from other OBO Foundry ontologies. While this first phase has focused on concepts for annotating samples, environments, exposures, and measurements, the next phase will center on supporting annotation of results and findings, such as concept models of molecular, cellular and tissue effects. The value of the RBO will be determined in part by our ability to engage the community in its development, and we have established a Radiobiology Informatics Consortium with unrestricted membership as the owner of the RBO in order to encourage investigators, system owners and other to join in this effort. Anyone can report issues or request new concept modeling or other features directly on GitHub. By using the BioPortal application programming interface, systems can pose dynamic queries to the latest version of the RBO for information on individual classes or entire hierarchies; this design eliminates the need for systems to be updated in order to use newer versions of the RBO. We hope to contribute to the advancement of open radiobiological science through the continued, open development of the RBO, that will provide more precise, machine-interpretable descriptions of investigations, as well as support data meta-analysis through machine learning or other artificial intelligence methods.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220000484,""endDate"":""2022-02-10T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""4d6625fc0714427f90d9d7495b001edb"",""id"":""a2e9c17e589741ec92701e33a8e1a3b3""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators Workshop 2022"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""4d6625fc0714427f90d9d7495b001edb"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/cd16f7a7-974e-441a-9378-8875e486b73b/websitePage:dce30028-529a-4c12-8d35-c55bdec57510?locale=en-US&i=SJzp6pe8fU6smd_UstjpcA"",""startDate"":""2022-02-07T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NASA"",""NNA14AB82C"",""NASA""]",undefined,"[""Computer Programming And Software""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220000484

20230007802,PRESENTATION,Data Sharing in Radiation Biology: Towards FAIR,"[""Paul N Schofield"",""Daniel Berrios"",""Luke T Slater"",""Jack Miller"",""Kristen Peach"",""Sylvain V Costes""]","The value of scientific data depends on their findability, accessibility, integrability and reusability according to the FAIR principles. Together with the sustainability of data preservation and access, these principles underpin the long term benefits of scientific research. Within the domain of radiobiology we have a huge array of data types, themes and complexities which make standardisation of metadata, data structure and data integration very challenging. Moreover, it is clear that, for example, in the area of disaster preparedness, the ready discovery and availability of multiple types of data, for example on biological effects of exposure, climatology, ecology, human behavioural and attitudinal studies, is important for an integrated scientific approach.

Because these data are spread over many databases, journal supplementary information resources and even the computers of the investigators, their discovery and reuse can be challenging. Despite exhortations from funding agencies and scientific institutions over the past two decades there is still a serious deficit in the willingness and in some cases the ability of investigators to share data, and although much may not be formally ""Public domain“, information about the existence of the data, their metadata, and how to obtain them should always be available.

We report the progress of work on three databases, the STORE and the NASA GeneLab and LSDA repositories to leverage the Radiation Biology Ontology (RBO), a structured terminology for metadata that can be used by all radiation biology-relevant databases to unite federated and automated data searches across multiple databases, for example using web services, and through semantic web technologies supporting data discovery.

The initial primary use-cases for RBO were archiving data in the STORE database (https://www.storedb.org/), the repository used for the RadoNorm and Pianoforte Projects among others, and in the NASA Open Science Data Repository (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio). The scope of radiobiology research ranges from basic physics to radiation oncology to sociolegal studies; no existing ontology had the necessary breadth or depth to fulfill this need. In addition, a formal ontology has the advantage of being usable for machine learning and, importantly, for tasks like data integration, knowledge extraction from the scientific literature and for query extension and data classification. Standardisation of metadata is one of the primary objectives of the FAIR principles for open data; RBO is an important landmark for FAIR-compliant radiation biology data sharing.

The RBO is developed using the open-source tools of GitHub and the OBO Foundry-led Ontology Development Kit, and published through GitHub and the NIH/NCBI BioPortal website. This initial phase of concept modeling has yielded an ontology that has more than 300 declared concepts, with more than 3500 additional concepts imported from other OBO Foundry ontologies with relevance to radiation biology (for example, concepts from the ISO standard Basic Formal Ontology, the Environment Ontology and the Gene Ontology).

We welcome input into the development of RBO and encourage its adoption.","[{""submissionId"":20230007802,""id"":""671783cb3c9b41248e0dfb479de20b51"",""publicationName"":"""",""publicationDate"":""2023-05-08T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""DE"",""submissionId"":20230007802,""endDate"":""2023-05-11T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""3eae3a18514d5db28582c5028cdafe0a"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Bundeswehr University Munich"",""location"":""Munich, Bayern, Germany""}},""meetingId"":""6d0a617581d147ba93d88d233c1b6a6e"",""id"":""de52a0110ef1424abbe3d832c5df7f73""}],""name"":""25th ConRad Nuclear Medical Defense Conference"",""location"":""Munich"",""id"":""6d0a617581d147ba93d88d233c1b6a6e"",""url"":""https://express.converia.de/frontend/index.php?folder_id=5982&page_id="",""startDate"":""2023-05-08T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C"",""EU 900009""]",undefined,"[""Documentation and Information Science"",""Computer Systems""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230007802

RadLab is intended to serve the needs of both the space radiation detector and space radiation biology communities.  The RadLab architecture is being designed to accommodate data both from low Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO). 
Our long-term vision entails the establishment of a sustainable database receiving continuous updates through APIs connecting to other databases, as well as individual investigator contributions via a RadLab submission portal, modeled on the OSDR (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/submission-sso-login.html). In addition to serving as a resource for space biologists and space radiation physicists, such a database would facilitate the deployment of AI algorithms to study the impact of location in space and within spacecraft on the ambient space radiation field.

Already we are deploying astronauts and cosmonauts for missions of approx. 6 months onboard the ISS. In the future we can anticipate that more people will be in space and they will be there for longer periods. Even with 6-months deployments to the ISS, the radiation exposure that crew members receive is approaching the exposure limits imposed by the governments of the space- faring nations. In the future we can expect radiation protection to be a dominant consideration for long manned missions. Recognizing this, NASA has expanded their research program on radiation health. This program has three components, bioastronautics, fundamental biology and radiation shielding materials. Bioastronautics is concerned with the investigating the effects of radiation on humans. Fundamental biology investigates the basic mechanisms of radiation damage to tissue. Radiation shielding materials research focuses on developing accurate computational tools to predict the radiation shielding effectiveness of materials. It also investigates new materials that can be used for spacecraft. The radiation shielding materials program will be described and examples of results from the ongoing research will be shown.","[{""submissionId"":20030111792,""id"":""9ac448c62cf149f9a073bc6480be97f9"",""publicationDate"":""2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Russia"",""submissionId"":20030111792,""endDate"":""2003-10-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Radiation Safety for Manned Mission to Mars Conference"",""location"":""Dubna"",""id"":""6802a67a01e449149c7a2a75ee655f0b"",""startDate"":""2003-09-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Radiation""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20030111792

The ISS is in low Earth orbit, facilitating regular resupply missions to deliver air, water, food, spare parts, and science experiments. NASA’s Moon to Mars campaign seeks to return humans to the Moon and prepare for crewed missions to Mars. Increased distance from Earth poses logistical challenges to provide all resources needed by humans for deep space missions. NASA Ames Research Center is conducting a series of synthetic biology projects to test the use of microbes for on-demand biosynthesis of human micronutrients. The BioNutrients spaceflight experiments test an implementation concept to produce fermented food products in which microbe growth enhances micronutrient content. On-demand production of carotenoids was engineered into two yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strains that have been tested in nearly 5 years of storage. One of the BioNutrients strains will be incorporated into the Lunar Explorer Instrument for Space Biology Applications (LEIA) project. LEIA is developing an instrument suite to be delivered to the lunar south pole region by the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The LEIA instrument suite will be used to measure multiple yeast strains for growth, metabolic activity, and synthetic biology-enabled production of carotenoids, while taking real time measurements of biologically relevant radiation exposure on the lunar surface. LEIA data will be used to assess the impact of lunar surface radiation and reduced gravity on the production of engineered traits.","[{""submissionId"":20240001989,""publisher"":""Springer Nature (United States)"",""id"":""2360480aaae744b7b565681b835c6b81"",""publicationName"":""In Vitro Cellular and Developmental Biology"",""publicationDate"":""2024-06-14T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240001989,""endDate"":""2024-06-12T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""a759f015c00e5250aa5cc07d34b90533"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Society for In Vitro Biology"",""location"":""Raleigh, North Carolina, United States""}},""meetingId"":""3befb9a57fc741579312ab57c4ec3476"",""id"":""1e95d04a487640bdbb5d6097619737da""}],""name"":""(SIVB) World Congress On In Vitro Biology"",""location"":""St. Louis, MO"",""id"":""3befb9a57fc741579312ab57c4ec3476"",""url"":""https://sivb.org/meetings/"",""startDate"":""2024-06-08T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""596118.04.25.21.03"",""207022.05.02.01.04.01.02"",""719125.05.12.01.15""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240001989
20210022916,PRESENTATION,INCREASING THE TRANSPARENCY AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF SPACE RADIATION SCIENCE: THE RADIATION BIOLOGY ONTOLOGY,"[""Daniel C Berrios"",""Jack Miller"",""Paul Schofield"",""Luke Slater"",""Sylvain V Costes""]","Among the primary objectives of the Open/Open-Source Science paradigm are making scientific investigation data transparent and results reproducible [1], objectives shared by the FAIR principles [2].  To accomplish this, the conceptual framework that includes all the investigation objects needs to be accurately captured and communicated to all data consumers.  A large part of this requires using metadata standards to annotate data collected. These standards should be readily accessible, informed by scientific community consensus and sufficiently specific to encompass all of the important aspects of the investigation.  Starting in 2020 we have been co-leading an open consortium to develop a new metadata standard, the Radiation Biology Ontology (RBO), through the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry [3].  We began by transforming many of the terms from the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement into concepts that can be formally related to existing OBO Foundry classes or attributes.  We then identified and imported into the RBO existing OBO Foundry classes that have obvious relevance for radiation biomedicine (for example, concepts from the Environment Ontology that describe radiative processes, and concepts from the Gene Ontology dealing with molecular and cellular responses to radiation).  Finally, we scrutinized datasets from investigations of radiation effects held in NASA GeneLab and LSDA repositories and added additional classes, instances, and attributes into the RBO that should be used to annotate these data.  We developed the RBO using the open-source tools of GitHub and publish the RBO periodically through the NIH/NCBI BioPortal website, so systems worldwide can leverage the knowledge it contains [4].  This initial phase of concept modeling has yielded an RBO that at present has more than 300 declared concepts, with more than 3500 additional concepts imported from other OBO Foundry ontologies.  While this first phase has focused on concepts for annotating samples, environments, exposures, and measurements, the next phase will center on supporting annotation of results and findings, such as concept models of molecular, cellular and tissue effects. The value of the RBO will be determined in part by our ability to engage the community in its development, and we have established a Radiobiology Informatics Consortium with unrestricted membership as the owner of the RBO in order to encourage investigators, system owners and other to join in this effort.  Anyone can report issues or request new concept modeling or other features directly on GitHub. By using the BioPortal application programming interface, systems can pose dynamic queries to the latest version of the RBO for information on individual classes or entire hierarchies; this design eliminates the need for systems to be updated in order to use newer versions of the RBO.  We hope to contribute to the advancement of open radiobiological science through the continued, open development of the RBO, that will provide more precise, machine-interpretable descriptions of investigations, as well as support data meta-analysis through machine learning or other artificial intelligence methods.

We are considering systems biology models to study radiation induced repair foci (RIRF) at low doses, in which less than one-track on average transverses the cell, and the subsequent DNA damage processing and signal transduction events. Computational approaches for describing protein regulatory networks coupled to DNA and oxidative damage sites include systems of differential equations, stochastic equations, and Monte-Carlo simulations. We review recent developments in the mathematical description of protein regulatory networks and possible approaches to radiation effects simulation. These include robustness, which states that regulatory networks maintain their functions against external and internal perturbations due to compensating properties of redundancy and molecular feedback controls, and modularity, which leads to general theorems for considering molecules that interact through a regulatory mechanism without exchange of matter leading to a block diagonal reduction of the connecting pathways. Identifying rate-limiting steps, robustness, and modularity in pathways perturbed by radiation damage are shown to be valid techniques for reducing large molecular systems to realistic computer simulations. Other techniques studied are the use of steady-state analysis, and the introduction of composite molecules or rate-constants to represent small collections of reactants. Applications of these techniques to describe spatial and temporal distributions of RIRF and cell populations following low dose irradiation are described.","[{""submissionId"":20070006621,""id"":""a51f28623cd74140b2b34847d3d4b921"",""publicationDate"":""2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Germany"",""submissionId"":20070006621,""endDate"":""2007-02-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""55d1e463e1ea4abeaa59980dca0ced83"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Gesellschaft fuer Strahlen- und Umweltforschung m.b.H."",""location"":""Munich, Germany""}},""meetingId"":""43b2d44e21b643b59556990b3dc3bead"",""id"":""bf63c926f023403eb735cc9f6626535e""}],""name"":""First International Workshop on System Radiation"",""location"":""Neuherberg/Munich"",""id"":""43b2d44e21b643b59556990b3dc3bead"",""startDate"":""2007-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070006621

To date, over fifty NASA balloon missions flown from Antarctica have carried scientific payloads from Astrophysics (APD) and Heliophysics (HPD)in SMD. Only two life science experiments have been flown from Antarctica, and both were ride-along (piggyback) opportunities, limiting the sophistication and types of model organisms that can be incorporated into studies. Herein, we argue for establishing a large, dedicated Antarctic balloon mission for the Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division in SMD to be launched in 2029/2030, with an “omnibus” gondola carrying dozens of independent Space Biology payloads that would receive a sustained exposure to low dose rate GCRs for 30+ days. Our unprecedented, protracted radiation experiment cannot be done using ground-based simulation facilities or in space; it can only be achieved through an Antarctic balloon mission dedicated to BPS Division payloads.

20180000898,ABSTRACT,Improving Satellite Compatible Microdevices to Study Biology in Space,"[""Kalkus, Trevor"",""Snyder, Jessica"",""Paulino-Lima, Ivan"",""Rothschild, Lynn""]","The technology for biology in space lags far behind the gold standard for biological experiments on Earth. To remedy this disparity, the Rothschild lab works on proof of concept, prototyping, and developing of new sensors and devices to further the capabilities of biology research on satellites. One such device is the PowerCell Payload System. One goal for synthetic biology in aiding space travel and colonization is to genetically engineer living cells to produce biochemicals in space. However, such farming in space presupposes bacteria retain their functionality post-launch, bombarded by radiation, and without the 1G of Earth. Our questions is, does a co-culture of cyanobacteria and protein-synthesizing bacteria produce Earth-like yields of target proteins? Is the yield sensitive to variable gravitational forces? To answer these questions, a PowerCell Payload System will spend 1 year aboard the German Aerospace Center's Euglena and Combined Regenerative Organic-food Production In Space (Eu:CROPIS) mission satellite. The PowerCell system is a pair of two 48-well microfluidic cards, each well seeded with bacteria. The system integrates fluidic, thermal, optical, electronic, and control systems to germinate bacteria spores, then measure the protein synthesized for comparison to parallel experiments conducted on the Earth. In developing the PowerCell Payload, we gained insight into the shortcomings of biology experiments on satellites. To address these issues, we have started three new prototyping projects: 1) The development of an extremely stable and radiation resistant cell-free system, allowing for the construction of proteins utilizing only cell components instead of living cells. This can be lyophilized on a substrate, like paper. (2) Using paper as a microfluidic platform that is flexible, stable, cheap, and wicking. The capillary action eliminates the need for pumps, reducing volume, mass, and potential failing points. Electrodes can be printed on the paper to sense for biochemicals.

Although many biological experiments have been performed in space since the 1960s, most have occurred in LEO and for only short periods of time. These LEO missions have studied many biological phenomena in a variety of model organisms, and have utilized a broad range of technologies. However, given the constraints of the deep space environment, upcoming deep space biological missions will be largely limited to microbial organisms and plant seeds using miniaturized technologies. Small satellites such as CubeSats are capable of querying relevant space environments using novel, miniaturized instruments and biosensors. CubeSats also provide a low-cost alternative to larger, more complex missions, and require minimal crew support, if any. Several have been deployed in LEO, but the next iterations of biological CubeSats will travel beyond LEO. They will utilize biosensors that can better elucidate the effects of the space environment on biology, allowing humanity to return safely to deep space, venturing farther than ever before.

Santa Maria""]","The BioSensor payload platform on BioSentinel and LEIA autonomously collects optical data from microbial model organisms in liquid culture. The BioSensor is designed to monitor metabolic activity using absorbance measurements of cell density and alamarBlue, a readily available colorimetric redox indicator dye. 

BioSentinel, a pioneering NASA CubeSat, uses yeast to study deep space radiation. LEIA investigates radiation and lunar gravity response. The experimental setup includes 16 wells equipped with three LEDs (570, 630, and 850 nm) and their corresponding photodetectors. One well is a calibration control without biology while the rest have desiccated cultures. Autonomous rehydration initiates the experiment. Data from the BioSensor are received from the flight and ground units, enabling comparison to uncover location-based metabolic rate variations.

This study presents a Python Jupyter notebook developed for efficient data processing of multiple CSV files containing date and time columns, temperature, and well illumination data. It offers a user-friendly interface while maintaining computational power, automatically recognizing and iteratively processing data files in a user-input path. A Hampel filter with a short window eliminates outlier artifacts from sensor dropout. Because absorbance is a relative measurement, conversion from raw illumination requires defining a “blank” value, so the first data points are averaged to provide the necessary denominator. A cube-root function correction mitigates undesired drift caused by air pockets during the fluidic card filling phase, maintaining optical path length consistency. Beer-Lambert's law is applied to further convert absorbance values to cell and dye form concentrations, the desired science parameters. The processed data are saved and visualized as SVG plots. 

Future plans include extracting specific science parameters from the processed data like growth rate and metabolic rate, and identification of features corresponding to metabolic and phenotypic shifts such as starvation, shifts from aerobic to anaerobic growth, and osmotic stresses.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230009148,""endDate"":""2023-11-18T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b1c62180924d415facccb4d6f057fad3"",""id"":""4026b2862bb6441f941937779dc61714""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) "",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""b1c62180924d415facccb4d6f057fad3"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2023-meeting/"",""startDate"":""2023-11-14T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""207022.05.02.01.04.01.01"",""80NSSC18M0060"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Space Radiation"",""Optics""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230009148

20250008622,ABSTRACT,Deep Space Radiation Characterization Onboard NASA’s BioSentinel CubeSat,"[""Sergio R Santa Maria""]","BioSentinel is the first biological CubeSat developed to travel beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). It is one of ten secondary payloads deployed from NASA’s Artemis I rocket on November 16, 2022. BioSentinel aims to develop an instrument capable of supporting biological organisms and to characterize the deep space radiation environment in preparation for future human exploration. To achieve these goals, the BioSentinel CubeSat carried two science payloads, a microfluidic-based instrument called BioSensor and a space radiation detector. In order to support, detect, and measure microbial cell growth and metabolic activity, the BioSensor has dedicated thermal control and optical measurement capabilities. The radiation detector measures the ionizing radiation dose and provides particle spectra based on their linear energy transfer (LET). Prior to Artemis I, identical instruments launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in late-2021, where they were successfully tested and validated. After launch and deployment, BioSentinel performed a lunar fly-by and reached a stable heliocentric orbit a few days later to initiate the science phase of the 6-month nominal mission. Even though all the payload and satellite instruments performed well early into the mission, the microfluidic subsystem inside the BioSensor experienced anomalies a few weeks after launch. It was decided to turn off the BioSensor to avoid compromising the other subsystems. The LET spectrometer continues to work nominally and has detected multiple solar particle events (SPEs) during the past 2.5 years and throughout solar maximum. As of July 2025, the satellite is currently at ~70 million kms from the Earth, 
communicating via the Deep Space Network (DSN) once per week. Despite its accomplishments, BioSentinel has faced many challenges that have contributed to lessons learned for upcoming missions beyond LEO, including the Lunar Explorer Instrument for space biology Applications (LEIA) mission, launching to the Moon on a commercial lander no earlier than 2027.",[],"[{""country"":""PR"",""submissionId"":20250008622,""endDate"":""2025-09-24T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""426499858bfb5eeebee9bd0b63129b00"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Bozeman, United States""}},""meetingId"":""074dfb3f52954143a33f7de032177cff"",""id"":""0f6b3bedcd2e463395adae1126718ec0""}],""name"":"" 71st Annual Meeting of the Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""San Juan"",""id"":""074dfb3f52954143a33f7de032177cff"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/b8aecb1e-5b4c-4514-907e-07a72dab956a/summary"",""startDate"":""2025-09-21T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""296511.01.01.17""]",undefined,"[""Space Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250008622

Basic mechanisms of molecular, cellular and tissue responses continue under investigation for radiations with a range of ionization densities. Late normal tissue effects, including the risk of cancer in particular, are of importance for both research fields. International cooperation has enhanced the rate of progress as evidenced by recent publications. Specific areas of biomedical research related to the biological radiotoxicity of critical organs (especially the central nervous system), individual radiosensitivities to radiation carcinogenesis, and the analysis of effects in mixed radiation fields still require more research.

The GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) version 4.0 will be available on October 1st 2019, and will provide a state-of-the-art bioinformatics platform for the space biology and radiation communities to upload their data into an omics data commons, to process their data with vetted standard workflows and to compare with existing analyses. Started in 2015 as a repository designed to archive omics data from space experiments, GeneLab has expanded its scope to all ionizing radiation omics experiments conducted on the ground and has put considerable effort in providing carefully characterized radiation metadata on all datasets. GeneLab is also providing processed data derived from the raw data covering a large spectrum of omics (genome, epigenome, transcriptome, epitranscriptome, proteome, metabolome) to help users explore important questions: 1) Which genes or proteins are expressed differently in space for various living organisms? 2) What specific DNA mutations or epigenetic changes happen in space or after exposure to ionizing radiation? and 3) How does genetics affect these responses? Processed data available on GeneLab are derived by standard data analysis workflows vetted by hundreds of scientists who volunteered to join one of the four GeneLab Analysis Working Groups (Animal AWG, Plant AWG, Microbe AWG, Multi-Omics AWG). In this presentation, we will discuss how to bridge the gap between irradiation studies performed on earth and biological experiments conducted in space since the early 1990's. We will discuss how radiation dosimetry was estimated for datasets derived from samples collected during the Space Shuttle era on the International Space Station and on other orbiting platforms.

cancer, cognitive decline, and cardiovascular issues among the primary concerns (Patel et al., 2020). Since 
the Apollo mission, the biological effects of space radiation on humans and the linked specific mechanisms 
remain incompletely understood, with no direct evidence linking space radiation exposure to specific 
health outcomes in astronauts with two notable exceptions: reduced latency to cataract formation and
light flash phenomena experienced during Apollo missions and South Atlantic Anomaly crossings. As 
humanity prepares for ambitious missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond, mitigating the long-term risks 
associated with galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE) is crucial. This chapter 
explores the latest findings on space radiation effects on human health and highlights the current 
knowledge gaps in human space radiation biology. Lastly, this chapter discusses emerging 
countermeasures that may help safeguard astronaut health in future deep-space missions. As NASA and 
other space agencies venture into deep space, it is critical to balance the promise of gene-editing 
interventions with their societal and ethical implications, particularly when these space-faring humans 
return to Earth or in the context of generational effects. Hence, we hope to shed some light by evaluating 
the feasibility and acceptability of such interventions, ensuring that future countermeasures align with 
both mission objectives, ethical standards, and the well-being of space explorers.","[{""submissionId"":20250004252,""publisher"":""Elsevier"",""id"":""56e19b5cf14147fcae0317acd9229745"",""publicationName"":""Health Impacts of Radiation in Space and Countermeasures"",""publicationDate"":""2025-05-12T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""80LARC23DA003""]",undefined,"[""Space Radiation""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250004252

The mission of GeneLab is to maximize the utilization of the valuable biological research resources aboard the ISS by collecting genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic (so-called omics) data to enable the exploration of the molecular network responses of terrestrial biology to space environments using a systems biology approach. All GeneLab data are made available to a worldwide network of researchers through its open-access data system. GeneLab is currently being developed by NASA to support Open Science biomedical research in order to enable the human exploration of space and improve life on earth. Open access to Phase 1 of the GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) was implemented in April 2015. Download volumes have grown steadily, mirroring the growth in curated space biology research data sets (61 as of June 2016), now exceeding 10 TB/month, with over 10,000 file downloads since the start of Phase 1. For the period April 2015 to May 2016, most frequently downloaded were data from studies of Mus musculus (39) followed closely by Arabidopsis thaliana (30), with the remaining downloads roughly equally split across 12 other organisms (each 10 of total downloads). GLDS Phase 2 is focusing on interoperability, supporting data federation, including integrated search capabilities, of GLDS-housed data sets with external data sources, such as gene expression data from NIHNCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), proteomic data from EBIs PRIDE system, and metagenomic data from Argonne National Laboratory's MG-RAST. GEO and MG-RAST employ specifications for investigation metadata that are different from those used by the GLDS and PRIDE (e.g., ISA-Tab). The GLDS Phase 2 system will implement a Google-like, full-text search engine using a Service-Oriented Architecture by utilizing publicly available RESTful web services Application Programming Interfaces (e.g., GEO Entrez Programming Utilities) and a Common Metadata Model (CMM) in order to accommodate the different metadata formats between the heterogeneous bioinformatics databases. GLDS Phase 2 completion with fully implemented capabilities will be made available to the general public in September 2017.","[{""submissionId"":20160012757,""id"":""2de243ebb96f40f8a42ef9cdabe434f8"",""publicationDate"":""2016-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160012757,""endDate"":""2016-10-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""3696d5284758434db039018f4e1ff7d7"",""id"":""bcbcbecdedb54b59b2140503c53650fa""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) Conference"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH"",""id"":""3696d5284758434db039018f4e1ff7d7"",""startDate"":""2016-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C"",""NNA16BD14C"",""NNA14AA60C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160012757

RadLab provides visual and programmatic interfaces for interrogation of its database, as well as a submission process for inclusion of data from investigators.

The RadLab application programming interface (API) implements a request syntax enabling users to retrieve data filtered by various combinations of parameters (detector type, location, direction, timespan, etc), which are delivered in machine-readable text formats, ready to be ingested by downstream analysis pipelines; while the graphical user interface (GUI) provides easy means to iteratively modify query parameters and incorporates a number of standard analyses and visualizations (time series plots, geospatial visualizations, detector comparison). 

Investigators from many countries, including US, Russia, Japan, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, and Italy, have committed to provide data from their instruments located on the ISS; RadLab will also include data from other spacecraft in LEO (e.g., the Space Shuttle, the Mir space station), BLEO (e. g. BioSentinel, Mars Orbiter, among others), and on other celestial bodies (e. g. Chang’e 4, Curiosity).

The first release of RadLab has been made available to the public. Once fully operational, RadLab will provide a comprehensive and ever-growing compendium of space radiation data, facilitating straightforward access to multiple types of readings and enabling space biology researchers to perform intercomparisons of detectors and to determine the radiation environment of research missions, both via programmatic retrieval of these data and via the graphical analysis toolkit; as well as a user-friendly submission portal for ingesting data from space agencies and research institutions. Radiation scientists will be able to use RadLab to gain a deeper understanding of the space radiation environment for future human space exploration.

The RadLab Working Group has been formed to foster close collaborations among data contributors and users, to identify data sources, to put in place standards for data normalization, to guide the development of features of the analysis toolkit, to establish the use of RadLab in space radiation biology research, and eventually to provide a forum for discussing relevant research issues that can take advantage of RadLab's capabilities.",[],"[{""country"":""KR"",""submissionId"":20240001998,""endDate"":""2024-07-21T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""3756368a762c4cd0a8faef647aaec052"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Committee on Space Research"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""c60cfba6c04a483ba4e0e56e490c2e6b"",""id"":""fac523d08e754502adf7ab64fb8d4437""},{""organizationId"":""4b26f911a19059f4a80294ec44e8dc3d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute"",""location"":""Daejeon, South Korea""}},""meetingId"":""c60cfba6c04a483ba4e0e56e490c2e6b"",""id"":""5e8fa249bdd44aeabc47f8a0ef4ef93a""}],""name"":""45th Scientific Assembly (COSPAR) "",""location"":""Busan"",""id"":""c60cfba6c04a483ba4e0e56e490c2e6b"",""url"":""https://www.cospar-assembly.org/assembly.php"",""startDate"":""2024-07-13T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.06.01.02.01.02"",""80NSSC18M0060"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240001998
20040087598,REPRINT,The impact of the new biology on radiation risks in space,"[""Dicello, John F.""]","Radiation is considered to be one of three or four major hazards for personnel in space and has emerged as the most critical issue to be resolved for long-term missions, both orbital and interplanetary. Space habitats are stressful and dangerous environments. Health and medical consequences arising from microgravity, stress, and trauma include weakened immune systems, increased viral activity, and loss of bone mass. The greatest risks from radiation are generally assumed to be cancers and possibly damage to the central nervous system. Synergistic effects arising from the other environmental hazards along with abscopal and exogenic factors are likely. Space programs represent an exceptional opportunity for examining the biological consequences of low-dose exposures of humans to radiation at every level of progression. Although astronauts are a relatively small population, they are healthy, physically active volunteers who undergo extensive testing and medical examinations before, during, and after protracted exposures with periodic follow-up examinations. The radiation environments along with other hazards are likewise monitored and documented. Extensive international research programs are in progress. Seven years ago the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration established the National Space Biomedical Research Institute through a cooperative agreement with a consortium of research and academic institutions in order to address radiation issues through a concerted, programmatic effort. Advanced technologies are rapidly being incorporated into these programs to determine the significance of new biological data and to evaluate the interplay among the different medical hazards. Programmatic in vivo and in vitro studies of the processes leading to carcinogenesis are in progress. Drugs and dietary supplements are being examined at the cellular and in vivo levels to assess their potential as dose-modifying agents.

The result is a substantial knowledge gap that poses risks to our ability to sustain life and conduct critical operations in deep space. The SpinSat spacecraft platform is designed to bridge such gaps by providing low-cost, reliable, and frequent access to deep space. A disk-shaped rotating satellite that can provide artificial gravity and exposure to space radiation simultaneously, SpinSat is designed to accommodate payloads in a CubeSat form factor (with at least 48 “U” volume), providing power, communications, and a benign thermal environment. It is orbit-agnostic, enabling access to a variety of radiation environments (Van Allen belts, deep space, cis-lunar); and can be equipped with shielding to mimic planetary radiation environments, for both short- and long-term experiments. Because of its versatility and prioritization of late loading for biological payloads, it is well suited to host a wide range of ranging from human tissues and organoids to microorganisms, plants, chemistry, and regolith.

Here, we present examples of potential experiment concepts for SpinSat, and discuss the details of how experimental designs could interact with the platform. Potential SpinSat studies have diverse applications, including fundamental radiation biology and DNA repair; cancer biology and countermeasure development; space agriculture; bioproduction of nutrients and pharmaceuticals; understanding regolith dynamics in low gravity; prebiotic chemistry and panspermia. We will further highlight ideas for SpinSat-compatible experimental hardware, existing and in development, and experiment-relevant details on SpinSat capabilities including artificial gravity, potential radiation environments, data, and power. This presentation will aim to provide investigators with the high-level technical information necessary to inspire experiments for SpinSat.

R.""]","Cell metabolism, secretion and cell-cell interactions can be altered during space flight. Early radiobiology experiments have demonstrated synergistic effects of radiation and microgravity as indicated by increased mutagenesis, increased chromosome aberrations, inhibited development, and retarded growth. Microgravity-induced changes in immune cell functions include reduced blastogenesis and cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, increased cytokine secretions, but inhibited cytotoxic effects an macrophage differentiation. These effects are important because of the high radiosensitivity of immune cells. It is difficult to compare ground studies with space radiation biology experiments because of the complexity of the space radiation environment, types of radiation damage and repair mechanisms. Altered intracellular functions and molecular mechanisms must be considered in the design and interpretation of space radiation experiments. Critical steps in radiocarcinogenesis could be affected.

By applying a novel self-delivery system to target 3 miRNAs (i.e. antagomirs) from our spaceflight miRNA signature impacting cardiovascular health risks, we were able to completely mitigate damage caused by exposure to simulated Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) irradiation. Here we further expand on the countermeasure experiments to uncover the specific novel biology involved with this countermeasure and in vivo experiments that demonstrates that these antagomirs rescue damage caused to certain organs due to both microgravity and space radiation. Specifically, the miRNAs rescued damage to the heart and immune suppression that occurred in addition to other key biology. In addition, we have also observed with the 3D microvascular tissue model improved DNA double strand break repair machinery which can also contribute to improved recovery and protection against damage caused by space radiation.

Furthermore, concepts for protective shielding also pose a technically challenging issue due to the nature of cosmic radiation and current mass and power constraints with modern exploration technology. The concern regarding exposure to cosmic radiation is the biological damage it induces. As damage is associated with increased oxidative stress, it is important and would be enabling to mitigate and/or prevent oxidative stress prior to the development of clinical symptoms and disease. This paper hypothesizes a ""systems biology"" approach in which a combination of chemical and biological mitigation techniques are used conjunctively. It proposes using new, therapeutic, medical gases as both chemical radioprotectors for radical scavenging and biological signaling molecules for management of the body s response to exposure. From reviewing radiochemistry of water, biological effects of CO, H2, NO, and H2S gas, and mechanisms of radiation biology, it is concluded that this approach may have great therapeutic potential for radiation exposure.

Currently, the GCRsim consists of 33 energetic ion beams that collectively simulate the primary and secondary GCR field encountered by astronauts over the broad range of particle types, energies, and linear energy transfer (LET) of interest to human health effects. A virtual workshop was held in December 2020 to assess the status of NASA's GCRsim and attendees examined various aspects of simulator design, with an emphasis on beam selection strategies. Modeling approaches, experimental constraints, areas of consensus, and questions of concern were also discussed in detail. An overview of the workshop considerations and discussion for research strategies that are important for future advancements and applications in space radio biology are presented.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20210021391,""endDate"":""2021-10-06T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""426499858bfb5eeebee9bd0b63129b00"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Bozeman, Montana, United States""}},""meetingId"":""fc822e8e8d2440f6903da17a24f14f94"",""id"":""96b2760a59b54954babcf2255a11d582""}],""name"":""Radiation Research Society Annual Meeting (Virtual)"",""location"":""Bozeman, MT"",""id"":""fc822e8e8d2440f6903da17a24f14f94"",""url"":""https://www.radres.org/events/EventDetails.aspx?id=1510123"",""startDate"":""2021-10-03T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""981698.01.04.23.43.03.09"",""NNL09AA00A"",""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Space Radiation""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210021391

20190029003,PRESENTATION,GeneLab: A Systems Biology Platform for Omics Analysis,"[""Costes, Sylvain V.""]","NASA GeneLab is an open-access repository for omics datasets generated by biological experiments conducted in space or experiments relevant to spaceflight (e.g. simulated cosmic radiation, simulated microgravity, bed rest studies). The GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) version 4.0 will be available on October 1st 2019, and will provide the latest in terms of professional state-of-the-art bioinformatics platform for the space biology and radiation community to upload their data into an omics data commons, to process their data with vetted standard workflows and to compare to existing analyses. Started in 2015 as a repository designed to archive omics data from space experiments, GeneLab has expanded its scope to all ionizing radiation omics experiments conducted on the ground and has put considerable effort in providing carefully characterized radiation metadata on all dataset. GeneLab is also providing processed data derived from the raw data covering a large spectrum of omics (genome, epigenome, transcriptome, epitranscriptome, proteome, metabolome) to help users explore important questions: 1) Which genes or proteins are expressed differently in space for various living organisms? 2) What specific DNA mutations or epigenetic changes happen in space or after exposure to ionizing radiation? and 3) How does genetics affect these responses? Processed data available on GeneLab are derived by standard data analysis workflows vetted by hundreds of scientists who volunteered to join one of the four GeneLab Analysis Working Groups (Animal AWG, Plant AWG, Microbe AWG, Multi-Omics AWG). In this presentation, we will discuss how to bridge the gap between irradiation studies performed on earth and biological experiments conducted in space since the early 1990's. We will discuss how radiation dosimetry was estimated for datasets derived from samples collected during the Space Shuttle era or on the International Space Station. Finally, we will address future strategies regarding dose monitoring in future missions into space, inter-agency efforts to unify data under one umbrella, and knowledge dissemination across the radiation research community and the space biology community.","[{""submissionId"":20190029003,""id"":""3be657aa6b264818a333aaa68dddce97"",""publicationDate"":""2019-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190029003,""name"":""Visit to NASA HQ"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""519709a06a334930be94835ad10db110"",""startDate"":""2019-09-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190029003
20160010055,ABSTRACT,Synthetic Biology as an Enabling Technology for Space Exploration,"[""Rothschild, Lynn J.""]","Human exploration off planet is severely limited by the cost of launching materials into space and by re-supply. Thus materials brought from Earth must be light, stable and reliable at destination. Using traditional approaches, a lunar or Mars base would require either transporting a hefty store of metals or heavy manufacturing equipment and construction materials for in situ extraction; both would severely limit any other mission objectives. Long-term human space presence requires periodic replenishment, adding a massive cost overhead. Even robotic missions often sacrifice science goals for heavy radiation and thermal protection. Biology has the potential to solve these problems because life can replicate and repair itself, and perform a wide variety of chemical reactions including making food, fuel and materials. Synthetic biology enhances and expands life's evolved repertoire. Using organisms as feedstock, additive manufacturing through bioprinting will make possible the dream of producing bespoke tools, food, smart fabrics and even replacement organs on demand. This new approach and the resulting novel products will enable human exploration and settlement on Mars, while providing new manufacturing approaches for life on Earth.","[{""submissionId"":20160010055,""id"":""31a0c7a16a954986846f00c4b1277abb"",""publicationDate"":""2016-08-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160010055,""name"":""NASA Glenn Research Center"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH, United States"",""id"":""df771a172cfe4a76b91f87ad36b518e5""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160010055,""endDate"":""2016-08-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Glenn Research Center"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH, United States""}},""meetingId"":""15a0d85227d245e6800efe999d1c6d03"",""id"":""1b3e8e94c1fb49ad81760b8eabed80b3""}],""name"":""NASA Biomimicry Summit and Education Forum 2016"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH"",""id"":""15a0d85227d245e6800efe999d1c6d03"",""startDate"":""2016-08-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Exobiology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160010055

This paper provides a summary of input data for ionizations, excitations and elastic scattering cross sections for event by event Monte Carlo track structure simulations for electrons and ions in the form of parametric equations, which makes it easy to reproduce the data. Stopping power and radial distribution of dose are presented for ions and compared with experimental data. A model is described for simulation of full slowing down of proton tracks in water in the range 1 keV to 1 MeV. Modelling and calculations are presented for the response of a TEPC proportional counter irradiated with 5 MeV alpha-particles. Distributions are presented for the wall and wall-less counters.

20210021582,PRESENTATION,Investigating Biological Responses to Space-like Radiation using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ,"[""Lauren Courtney Liddell"",""Sergio Renan Santa Maria"",""Diana Marron Gentry""]","As we plan crewed missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond, it is essential to understand how persistent exposure to space radiation affects biology. Unlike on the International Space Station, where crew support and sample return are possible, experiments for long-duration missions require autonomous systems with no sample return.

Human cells would be ideal biosensors, but limitations in culture methods, extended prelaunch storage, and long flight durations make it very difficult to keep human cells alive. Unlike other model systems, yeast can survive the constraints of long-duration spaceflight. Despite a billion years of evolution separating yeast from humans, we share homology in hundreds of genes important for basic cell function, including responses to DNA damage. Thus, yeast are excellent biosensors for detecting types/extent of damage induced by space radiation.

BioSentinel is NASA’s latest biological CubeSat, and first interplanetary space bioscience mission. BioSentinel is manifested on Artemis 1, the first test flight of NASA’s Space Launch System, in the coming year. The BioSensor payload within BioSentinel contains two yeast strains. The wild type serves as a control for health and “normal” DNA damage repair (DDR). The rad51 deletion mutant is defective for DDR and will undergo alterations to growth and metabolism as it accumulates radiation damage. Changes in growth and metabolic activity will be measured using a 3-color LED detection system and the metabolic redox dye alamarBlue®.

Preliminary tests indicate a significant change in alamarBlue response to space-like, low-dose ionizing radiation. We will discuss these findings in four parts – Introduction to biological CubeSats and the BioSentinel mission (presented by Sergio Santa Maria), preliminary responses to space-like ionizing radiation (presented here), a deeper dive into tracking metabolic changes after exposure to ionizing radiation (presented by Diana Gentry), and a look into methods for correcting flight optical data (presented by Abbey Kim).

Reinsch"",""Joseph Varelas"",""Mo Kaze"",""Samrawit G. Gebre""]","The NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC) is a biorepository of non-human biospecimens from NASA-funded spaceflight investigations and correlative ground studies. The collection has its roots in the 1960s through collaborations by NASA Ames Research Center with other NASA centers, universities, and international space agencies by sharing non-human biospecimens from spaceflight and space-relevant ground experiments.  These collaborations have advanced the field of space exploration by helping to maximize the data gained from spaceflight and other NASA-funded experiments. NBISC coordinates closely with the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) which is responsible for organized sample collection from spaceflight and ground rodent experiments. In 2022 NBISC partnered with HRP’s Biospecimen and Tissue Sharing Collection (BTSC) Program to also archive samples from HRP’s Space Radiation Element-funded studies which primarily involve rodents exposed to various radiation protocols at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) and other analog facilities. To date, more than fifty thousand biospecimens from BTSC have been transferred to NBISC for distribution to the community. In 2023, NBISC embarked on a new Space Biology funded endeavor to create the Space Microbial Culture Collection (SMCC) which will serve as a central repository for microbial isolates associated with space flight, gravitational, and space radiation research.  This presentation will highlight several success stories of analyses carried out using archived NBISC samples received by researchers in recent years and will detail the process for proposing and receiving samples from NBISC, BTSC and SMCC.

20220001790,PRESENTATION,microRNA Based Countermeasure Mitigate Health Risks Associated with Space Radiation and Microgravity,"[""Afshin Beheshti""]","From our earlier work, we demonstrated a circulating microRNA (miRNA) signature that is present and involved with the general increased health risks during spaceflight. From this work we demonstrated that this miRNA signature impacted the overall biology and health with both the microgravity and space radiation components of the space environment. We showed that this miRNA signature can be an optimal biomarker for health risk and also has potential to be utilized as a countermeasure to mitigate the damage caused by the space environment by utilizing a human 3D microvascular tissue model. By applying a novel self-delivery system to target 3 miRNAs (i.e. antagomirs) from our spaceflight miRNA signature impacting cardiovascular health risks, we were able to completely mitigate damage caused by exposure to simulated Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) irradiation. Here we further expand on the countermeasure experiments to uncover the specific novel biology involved with this countermeasure and in vivo experiments that demonstrates that these antagomirs rescue damage caused to certain organs due to both microgravity and space radiation. Specifically, the miRNAs rescued damage to the heart and immune suppression that occurred in addition to other key biology. In addition, we have also observed with the 3D microvascular tissue model improved DNA double strand break repair machinery which can also contribute to improved recovery and protection against damage caused by space radiation. This work expands on our previous work and further uncovers how a potential minimally invasive countermeasure can be used to mitigate space environment effects.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220001790,""endDate"":""2022-02-10T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""68a25120f09a4d7d95de38a4def52297"",""id"":""aa5b7fd09030437294685eb506f16460""}],""name"":""The 2022 Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS 2022)"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""68a25120f09a4d7d95de38a4def52297"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/cd16f7a7-974e-441a-9378-8875e486b73b/summary?i=15a726d7-6077-413f-b125-b88ebb78f58b"",""startDate"":""2022-02-07T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C"",""16-ROSBFP_GL-0005"",""NNH16ZTT001N-FG"",""80NSSC19K0883"",""NNX16AO69A""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Space Radiation""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220001790
20160003861,OTHER,2015 Space Radiation Standing Review Panel,"[""Steinberg, Susan""]","The 2015 Space Radiation Standing Review Panel (from here on referred to as the SRP) met for a site visit in Houston, TX on December 8 - 9, 2015. The SRP met with representatives from the Space Radiation Element and members of the Human Research Program (HRP) to review the updated research plan for the Risk of Radiation Carcinogenesis Cancer Risk. The SRP also reviewed the newly revised Evidence Reports for the Risk of Acute Radiation Syndromes Due to Solar Particle Events (SPEs) (Acute Risk), the Risk of Acute (In-flight) and Late Central Nervous System Effects from Radiation Exposure (CNS Risk), and the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Other Degenerative Tissue Effects from Radiation (Degen Risk), as well as a status update on these Risks. The SRP would like to commend Dr. Simonsen, Dr. Huff, Dr. Nelson, and Dr. Patel for their detailed presentations. The Space Radiation Element did a great job presenting a very large volume of material. The SRP considers it to be a strong program that is well-organized, well-coordinated and generates valuable data. The SRP commended the tissue sharing protocols, working groups, systems biology analysis, and standardization of models. In several of the discussed areas the SRP suggested improvements of the research plans in the future. These include the following: It is important that the team has expanded efforts examining immunology and inflammation as important components of the space radiation biological response. This is an overarching and important focus that is likely to apply to all aspects of the program including acute, CVD, CNS, cancer and others. Given that the area of immunology/inflammation is highly complex (and especially so as it relates to radiation), it warrants the expansion of investigators expertise in immunology and inflammation to work with the individual research projects and also the NASA Specialized Center of Research (NSCORs). Historical data on radiation injury to be entered into the Watson “big data” study must be used with caution. The general scientific issues of reproducibility, details of experimental methods and data analysis from preclinical and basic research laboratories have been raised broadly over the last few years (not specific to this work) and indicate that caution must be applied in the ways these data are used. This pertains to preclinical data and also to phase 3 clinical trials in radiation oncology and medical oncology. Of course, appropriate use and analysis of these “big-data” sets also offer the potential of pinpointing limitations and extracting remaining useful information. Emphasis should be placed on the latter possibility. A key target is risk reduction from radiation exposure. Progress of the entire space program, now moving towards the Mars mission, requires timely answers to key components of human risk, which are known to be complex. Periodic review of progress should be conducted with additional resources directed into achieving critical milestones. Turning the long red bars to yellow and green (or for some risks such as CNS possibly to grey) must be high priority. That such progress will require new science and not engineering means that it should be viewed in a knowledge-based light. The technology-based aspects of engineering issues are certainly as important, however, science and knowledge-based problems are solved in a different way than engineering. Timelines for engineering are more predictable, while for science, progress can be methodical with occasional major incremental findings that can rapidly change the rate of progress. As opportunities for rapid incremental changes arise, periodic enhancement of investment is strongly recommended to enable such new knowledge to be quickly and efficiently exploited. Collaborations and linkages with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) are in place and more are encouraged, where possible, with the radiation injury and medical countermeasure studies. This could include utilizing some of their animal model testing contracts to facilitate obtaining results using common platforms. Such approach will facilitate the comparison of results among laboratories, and will facilitate and accelerate the development of medical countermeasures. It is particularly noteworthy that the NASA Space Radiation Element is reaching out to the Multidisciplinary European Low Dose Initiative (MELODI) platform coordinating low dose radiation risk research, and to other international agencies that are studying low dose radiation effects in an effort to fill the void generated by the cancelation of the Department of Energy (DOE) low dose radiation program. While NASA is working actively with NIAID and BARDA to integrate their relevant findings of radiation mitigator investigations to NASA programs, the committee notes its disappointment that the United States currently lacks a dedicated low dose radiation program with clear mechanistic orientation and aimed at the quantification and mitigation of human radiation risk on Earth. This void gives to the NASA Space Radiation Program Element special societal value, but also makes its overall design more challenging.","[{""submissionId"":20160003861,""id"":""cb86a9c453bf467aad86e3b4e257dfa2"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160003861,""endDate"":""2015-12-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""2015 Space Radiation Standing Review Panel Meeting"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""5a15d72cc3e74bb189fd7f52f6873ca3"",""startDate"":""2015-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Space Radiation""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160003861
20230009560,PRESENTATION,RadLab and the Environmental Data Application Dashboard: Graphical and Programming Interfaces for Interrogation of Space Telemetry Data,"[""Kirill Grigorev"",""Ana Uriarte Acuna"",""Lauren M Sanders"",""Danielle K Lopez"",""Ryan T Scott"",""Samrawit G Gebre"",""Jack Miller"",""Livio Narici"",""Sylvain V Costes""]","Sensors on the International Space Station (ISS) and multiple spacecraft elsewhere in Earth orbit and in deep space continuously monitor and collect environmental data, transmitting this information back to Earth. These data include ionizing radiation and, on the ISS, CO2, relative humidity levels, and temperature, and are of great importance to space biology research. Ionizing radiation in particular has been established in ground-based experiments as being correlated with increased risk of carcinogenesis and cardiovascular and neurological effects. Looking ahead to future long duration crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit, the ability to study how factors including CO2 levels, light cycle, temperature modulate the response to ionizing radiation and microgravity is essential. To date, access to these data has been fragmented across space agencies, spacecraft, and databases. To address this issue, NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) has developed two Web applications: the Environmental Data Application (EDA) and a radiation-specific RadLab. Each consists of an API (application programming interface) and an associated GUI (graphical user interface) that provide single points of access to the data. To date, OSDR has focused on the sensors from payloads and radiation detectors located on the ISS. The Web applications process telemetry information and associated data, such as spacecraft location and orientation, from multiple international databases. The applications’ request syntax enables users to interrogate these data by craft, sensor type, time range, radiation type (galactic cosmic rays, solar particle events, the contribution of the South Atlantic Anomaly), facilitating arbitrary comparisons of original source data at varying time resolutions. The applications provide programmatic access for use in computational pipelines and GUIs for data visualization and exploration, making these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), complementing the biological data contained in OSDR, and providing the space science community with a valuable resource for scientific analyses.

To better understand deep space radiation biology, the LEIA mission will measure charged particles and fast neutrons as well as yeast growth, metabolic rate, and bioengineered production of carotenoids at the lunar surface. LEIA will be delivered to the south polar region of the Moon by the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The LEIA science concept of operations was developed to isolate radiation and partial gravity from other environmental conditions experienced by the payload. Due to CLPS integration requirements, there will be at least eight months from loading yeast into the payload until activation on the lunar surface. Replicate yeast strains will be loaded in a randomized complete block design to minimize batch differences in desiccation tolerance and positional effects in the microfluidics culture system. Temperature and relative humidity will be controlled throughout integration and flight to maintain yeast viability and to enable measurement of yeast growth parameters within the lunar surface operations timeframe, with the ground control matching environmental conditions where possible. LEIA is co-manifested with the European Space Agency’s PROSPECT mission, which will be operating a drill during yeast growth. Vibration translated through the lunar lander will be mitigated and quantified to account for potential impacts on LEIA optical measurements and yeast growth rate. Total space radiation dose, including the transit exposure from Earth to the Moon, will be measured to obtain more accurate charged particle and fast neutron dose rates on the lunar surface. These radiation data will also yield ground truth radiation dose experienced by the yeast during the mission.

algorithm performance through the benchmarking process. A scientific benchmark consists of an AI-ready dataset and a reference implementation on a specific scientific question. The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has started the “Benchmark Initiative for AI/ML to create scientific benchmark datasets in three applications: 1) scientific benchmarking, which finds the best algorithm for a specific problem; 2) application benchmarking, which measures algorithm performance against a set of parameters; and 3) system benchmarking, which evaluates performance of hardware and software architecture. Currently, there are no standardized datasets available to benchmark AI/ML algorithms in the domain of space biology. In this work, we constructed two AI/ML-ready biological datasets from experiments in space-flown mice: cellular imaging and RNA-seq. First, radiation-exposed immune cells harbor DNA damage foci that can be fluorescently marked to visualize the amount of damage following exposure to ionizing radiation. However, such large datasets are difficult to analyze visually, due to imaging inconsistencies and human bias, and classical image processing approaches can fail on imaging artifacts. AI/ML are therefore exciting alternative, providing the speed of machines and the accuracy of humans. We have made this dataset available at https://registry.opendata.aws/bps_microscopy/. Second, high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing (DNA-seq, RNA-seq) has become widespread in biomedical research due to the growing availability and affordability of these assays. However, most sequencing datasets suffer from high dimensionality and low sample count. In this work, we used a generative adversarial network to synthesize a standardized, AI-ready, publicly available benchmark dataset for space biology RNA-seq data with sufficient space-flown and ground control mouse liver samples from NASA GeneLab. This dataset is available at https://registry.opendata.aws/bps_rnaseq/.

Developing useful biophysical parameters or models that relate energy deposition by space particles to the probabilities of biological outcomes is a complex problem. Physical measurements of space radiation include the absorbed dose, dose equivalent, and linear energy transfer (LET) spectra. In contrast to conventional dosimetric methods, models of radiation track structure provide descriptions of energy deposition events in biomolecules, cells, or tissues, which can be used to develop biophysical models of radiation risks. In this paper, we address the biophysical description of heavy particle tracks in the context of the interpretation of both space radiation dosimetry and radiobiology data, which may provide insights into new approaches to these problems.","[{""volume"":""16"",""submissionId"":20040087541,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""1089-988X"",""id"":""e32d522c25f3427aa3f1da886301d3d9"",""publicationName"":""Gravitational and space biology bulletin :  publication of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""publicationDate"":""2003-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040087541

S."",""Shirazi-Fard, Y."",""Pletcher, D."",""Globus, R.""]","NASA has flown animals to space as part of trailblazing missions and to understand the biological responses to spaceflight. Mice traveled in the Lunar Module with the Apollo 17 astronauts and now mice are frequent research subjects in LEO on the ISS. The ISS rodent missions have focused on unravelling biological mechanisms, better understanding risks to astronaut health, and testing candidate countermeasures. A critical barrier for longer-duration animal missions is the need for humans-in-the-loop to perform animal husbandry and perform routine tasks during a mission. Using autonomous or telerobotic systems to alleviate some of these tasks would enable longer-duration missions to be performed at the Deep Space Gateway. Rodent missions performed using the Gateway as a platform could address a number of critical risks identified by the Human Research Program (HRP), as well as Space Biology Program questions identified by NRC Decadal Survey on Biological and Physical Sciences in Space, (2011). HRP risk areas of potentially greatest relevance that the Gateway rodent missions can address include those related to visual impairment (VIIP) and radiation risks to central nervous system, cardiovascular disease, as well as countermeasure testing. Space Biology focus areas addressed by the Gateway rodent missions include mechanisms and combinatorial effects of microgravity and radiation. The objectives of the work proposed here are to 1) develop capability for semi-autonomous rodent research in cis-lunar orbit, 2) conduct key experiments for testing countermeasures against low gravity and space radiation. The hardware and operations system developed will enable experiments at least one month in duration, which potentially could be extended to one year in duration. To gain novel insights into the health risks to crew of deep space travel (i.e., exposure to space radiation), results obtained from Gateway flight rodents can be compared to ground control groups and separate groups of mice exposed to simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (at the NASA Space Radiation Lab). Results can then be compared to identical experiments conducted on the ISS. Together results from Gateway, ground-based, and ISS rodent experiments will provide novel insight into the effects of space radiation.","[{""submissionId"":20180001902,""id"":""f1aa94cbf6184150b3f8c0796888472f"",""publicationDate"":""2018-02-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180001902,""endDate"":""2018-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""eda29fd212d142529aac03c28c3442f4"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Boulder, CO, United States""}},""meetingId"":""5d16bea3f2aa4b59bf15d578c21e2bb7"",""id"":""d4866afa66f14649a6279f9fd70b00b9""}],""name"":""Deep Space Gateway Concept Science Workshop"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""5d16bea3f2aa4b59bf15d578c21e2bb7"",""startDate"":""2018-02-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180001902
20060026027,ABSTRACT,Low-gravity Orbiting Research Laboratory Environment Potential Impact on Space Biology Research,"[""Jules, Kenol""]","One of the major objectives of any orbital space research platform is to provide a quiescent low gravity, preferably a zero gravity environment, to perform fundamental as well as applied research. However, small disturbances exist onboard any low earth orbital research platform. The impact of these disturbances must be taken into account by space research scientists during their research planning, design and data analysis in order to avoid confounding factors in their science results. The reduced gravity environment of an orbiting research platform in low earth orbit is a complex phenomenon. Many factors, among others, such as experiment operations, equipment operation, life support systems and crew activity (if it is a crewed platform), aerodynamic drag, gravity gradient, rotational effects as well as the vehicle structural resonance frequencies (structural modes) contribute to form the overall reduced gravity environment in which space research is performed. The contribution of these small disturbances or accelerations is precisely why the environment is NOT a zero gravity environment, but a reduced acceleration environment. This paper does not discuss other factors such as radiation, electromagnetic interference, thermal and pressure gradient changes, acoustic and CO2 build-up to name a few that affect the space research environment as well, but it focuses solely on the magnitude of the acceleration level found on orbiting research laboratory used by research scientists to conduct space research. For ease of analysis this paper divides the frequency spectrum relevant to most of the space research disciplines into three regimes: a) quasi-steady, b) vibratory and c) transient. The International Space Station is used as an example to illustrate the point. The paper discusses the impact of these three regimes on space biology research and results from space flown experiments are used to illustrate the potential negative impact of these disturbances (accelerations) on space biology research.","[{""submissionId"":20060026027,""id"":""889446f108bc4d90849ce92a55c30f9c"",""publicationDate"":""2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20060026027,""name"":""International Astronautical Federation"",""location"":""Paris, France"",""id"":""1141f86df1054ea2b01809798487da43""},{""country"":""France"",""submissionId"":20060026027,""endDate"":""2006-10-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Astronautical Federation"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""3768cc994f3b46f4bf4c4382d34daa03"",""id"":""b0568864aec3497eb60d9f1ccc800a4f""}],""name"":""57th International Astronautical Congress"",""location"":""Paris"",""id"":""3768cc994f3b46f4bf4c4382d34daa03"",""startDate"":""2006-10-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Exobiology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20060026027

The ISS mission launched in December 2021, and returned to the ground in August 2022 after successfully completing eight biological experiments while validating the different instruments. On the other hand, the deep space mission launched onboard Artemis I in November 2022, and is currently in a heliocentric orbit over 20 million kilometers away from the Earth. Even though all hardware subsystems were validated in deep space, the microfluidic subsystems experienced anomalies throughout the initial 6-month mission. The main goals of this presentation are (1) to present flight data from the deep space payload, including biology, fluidics, electronics, data processing, and mission operations, and (2) to discuss the lessons learned – what worked and what did not – from this unique complex mission, and how these lessons are aiding in the development of the Lunar Exploration Instrument for space biology Applications (LEIA) mission, launching to the lunar surface on a commercial lander in 2026.

That could be explained in part by the decrease in smoking over the years, which has an intriguing protective effect on the risk of PD. Moreover, recent studies have found an increased risk of PD in individuals exposed to ionizing radiation, including at low doses. Because astronauts are non-smokers, and exposed to radiation in space, their background and radiation-induced risks of PD must be considered. 

The risk of radiation-induced PD can be included in the NASA space radiation risk code and evaluated using the metrics of risk of exposure induced death (REID) and risk of exposure induced cases (REIC) as it is done for cancer and cardiovascular diseases. To perform this calculation, the age-specific incidence and mortality rates, the excess radiation risk function, and the radiation dose, including quality factors, are needed. The incidence and mortality rates are calculated using epidemiological data obtained from the general U.S. population. The excess radiation risk is described by an excess relative risk model, which is 1.7 per Gy according to recent meta-analysis studies. Using available information, we performed a preliminary calculation of the REID values for 1) A 1-year deep space mission; 2) A Mars Mission, consisting of 730 days of transit and 30 days on the Mars surface. 

The preliminary results of the PD REID are the same order of magnitude compared to similar calculations done for radiation-induced cancer, with a strong sex dependence. Therefore, radiation-induced PD may be important for astronauts. More research is needed in epidemiology to strengthen the findings and in biology to understand the relevant mechanisms, notably the roles of ionizing radiation and protection by smoking.",[],"[{""country"":""PR"",""submissionId"":20250003824,""endDate"":""2025-09-24T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""426499858bfb5eeebee9bd0b63129b00"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Bozeman, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6a3e088d87c04f88b513ff1ce4c07bf4"",""id"":""e8156010bddf47e69c1dab310279ef2e""}],""name"":""71st Annual Meeting of the Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""San Juan"",""id"":""6a3e088d87c04f88b513ff1ce4c07bf4"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/b8aecb1e-5b4c-4514-907e-07a72dab956a/summary"",""startDate"":""2025-09-21T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""100429.2.03.08.41.1881 ""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20240015904,""title"":""Risk Model Development for Radiation-induced Parkinson’s Disease Mortality and Consequence for Space Exploration""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250003824

The Space Health Impacts for the NASA Experience (SHINE) space radiation didactic curriculum aims to educate participants not only in the scientific aspects of space radiation but also in the agency’s risk management strategies. SHINE combines weekly seminars by speakers from NASA, other government agencies, academia, and industry, with networking sessions designed to foster collaboration between participants and interactions with NASA scientists and HRP funded investigators. The inaugural course ran weekly from February 2023 to August 2023 and was comprised of lectures, less formal coffee hours and office hours. The SHINE topics ranged from space environments to health effects and countermeasure to granting opportunities. Participants developed beam time proposals for real, proposed, or potential experiments at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. For the 2023 course, a total of 59 applications were received from which 25 participants were selected. Selected participants were citizens from 8 countries and comprised 5 graduate students, 4 postdocs, 11 scientists and 5 professors/medical doctors. Participants had a wide range of expertise including molecular and cellular biology, microbiology, botany, physiology, engineering, physics, aerospace medicine, planetary science, biostatistics, and modeling.

LEIA is part of the CP-22 Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) surface mission to the south polar region of the Moon. The biological payload will test genetic factors that are likely to influence the tolerance of yeast for deep space and lunar surface radiation. LEIA is also investigating in-space production of β-carotene in bioengineered yeast. This carotenoid is both an antioxidant and pro-vitamin A- an essential human micronutrient. We report progress on engineering carotenoid-expressing strains to test the impacts of strain background and specific genetic variants on growth and production of β-carotene. To test for enhanced sensitivity to the LEIA mission environment, we generated gene knockouts for the RAD51 DNA damage repair locus as well as the SOD1, SOD2, and TSA1 reactive oxygen species (ROS) defense enzymes. We are also generating strains expected to increase tolerance to abiotic stressors and ROS. To be included in the biology payload, each strain needs to satisfy a series of requirements to be compatible with the mission concept of operations. The LEIA mission will conduct experiments using an autonomous light emitting diode optical detection system and microfluidics incubator to quantify growth, metabolism, and carotenoid production. Strains must produce sufficient carotenoids for bioproduction to be detectable with this optical system. Cells will be loaded into microfluidics cards, desiccated, and stored for 8-12 months prior to the initiation of lunar surface operations. The CLPS lander will operate for one lunar day, and strains will need to grow to stationary phase within 96 hours to ensure that telemetry of LEIA data to Earth can be completed. Genetic variants also need to display expected phenotypes within these optical detection, storage, and growth cycle constraints.

Resultant knowledge gaps pose risks to life support, human health and performance, and many operations critical to space and planetary exploration. By providing low-cost, reliable, frequent access to beyond-low-Earth-orbit space environments, the SpinSat platform will bridge such gaps. A disk-shaped rotating small spacecraft that provides simultaneous artificial gravity, exposure to tailored space radiation, and a benign thermal environment, SpinSat will accommodate at least 48U of CubeSat form-factor payloads per mission, providing power, data handling, and communications. It is orbit-agnostic, enabling access to a variety of radiation environments (Van Allen belts, deep space, cis-lunar), and can be equipped with shielding to mimic planetary radiation environments, for experiment durations from days to many months. SpinSat prioritizes late loading for biological payloads, suiting it to host everything from human tissues and organoids to microorganisms, plants, chemical reactions, physics experiments, materials processing, and engineering components and subsystems.
After summarizing the platform, we will offer exemplary experiment concepts suitable for SpinSat, and discuss how various aspects of experimental designs may interact with, and be accommodated by, the platform. The range of diverse applications envisioned to be implemented as CubeSat form-factor payloads includes fundamental radiation biology such as DNA damage and repair; cancer biology and countermeasure development; space agriculture; bioproduction of nutrients and pharmaceuticals; biology-based life-support and waste-management systems; understanding regolith-transfer dynamics in low gravity; multigenerational microbial evolution; prebiotic chemistry and panspermia. We will further highlight ideas for SpinSat-compatible experimental hardware, existing and in development, and experiment-relevant details on SpinSat capabilities including artificial gravity, customized radiation environments, data, and power. We aim to inspire the design and development of novel experiments for SpinSat, many of which might exist or be planned as current or future CubeSat payloads. We also seek community input to help guide the evolving design of this platform and the payloads it will accommodate.

19940039108,REPRINT,Long-term modulation of galactic cosmic radiation and its model for space exploration,"[""Badhwan, G. D."",""O'Neill, P. M.""]","As the human exploration of space has received new attention in the United States, studies find that exposure to space radiation could adversely impact the mission design. Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), with its very wide range of charges and energies, is particularly important for a mission to Mars, because it imposes a stiff mass penalty for spacecraft shielding. Dose equivalent versus shielding thickness calculations, show a rapid initial drop on exposure with thickness, but an asymptotic behavior at a higher shielding thickness. Uncertainties in the radiobiology are largely unknown. For a fixed radiation risk, this leads to large uncertainties in shielding thickness for small uncertainties in estimated dose. In this paper we investigate the application of steady-state, spherically-symmetric diffusion-convection theory of solar modulation to individual measurements of differential energy spectra from 1954 to 1989 in order to estimate the diffusion coefficient, kappa(r,t), as a function of time. We have correlated the diffusion coefficient to the Climax neutron monitor rates and show that, if the diffusion coefficient can be separated into independent functions of space and time: kappa(r,t)=K(t) k(sub 0) beta Pk(sub 1) (r), where beta is the particle velocity and P the rigidity, then (i) The time dependent quantity 1/K(t), which is proportional to the deceleration potential, phi(r,t), is linearly related to the Climax neutron monitor counting rate. (ii) The coefficients obtained from hydrogen or helium intensity measurements are the same. (iii) There are different correlation functions for odd and even solar cycles. (iv) The correlation function for the Climax neutron monitor counting rate for given time, t, can be used to estimate mean deceleration parameter phi(t) to within +/- 15% with 90% confidence. We have shown that k(r,t) determined from hydrogen and/or helium data, can be used to fit the oxygen and iron differential energy spectra with a root mean square error of about +/- 10%, and essentially independent of the particle charge or energy. We have also examined the ion chamber and C-14 measurements which allow the analysis to be extended from the year 1906 to 1990. Using this model we have defined reference GCR spectra at solar minimum and solar maximum. These can be used for space exploration studies and provide a quantitative estimate of the error in dose due to changes in GCR intensities.","[{""volume"":""14"",""submissionId"":19940039108,""issue"":""10"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""3028a372dab148f29fa78759c48c9e69"",""publicationName"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1"",""publicationDate"":""1994-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Radiation""]","[{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""},{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940039108

A.""]","Active ingredients consisting of Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC) and a Proton and Heavy Ion Detector (PHIDE) have been carried on a number of Space Shuttle flights. These instruments have allowed us to map out parts of the South Atlantic Particle Anomaly (SAA) and to compare some of it's features with predictions of the AP-8 energetic proton flux models. We have observed that consistent with the generally observed westward drift of the surface features of the terrestial magnetic field of the SAA has moved west by about 6.9 degrees longitude between the epoch year 1970 of the AP-8 solar maximum model and the Space Shuttle observations made twenty years later. However, calculations indicate that except for relatively brief periods following very large magnetic storms the SAA seems to occupy the same position in L-space as in 1970. After the great storm of 24 March 1991 reconfiguration of the inner radiation belt and/or proton injection into the inner belt, a second energetic proton belt was observed to form at approximately equal to 2. As confirmed by a subsequent flight observations, this belt was shown to persist at least for six months.

20090015364,ABSTRACT,Biophysics Representation of the Two-Hit Model of Alzheimer's Disease for the Exploration of Late CNS Risks from Space Radiation,"[""Cucinotta, Francis A."",""Ponomarev, Artem""]","A concern for long-term space travel outside the Earth s magnetic field is the late effects to the central nervous system (CNS) from galactic cosmic ray (GCR) or solar particle events (SPE). Human epidemiology data is severely limited for making CNS risk estimates and it is not clear such effects occur following low LET exposures. We are developing systems biology models based on biological information on specific diseases, and experimental data for proton and heavy ion radiation. A two-hit model of Alzheimer s disease (AD) has been proposed by Zhu et al.(1), which is the framework of our model. Of importance is that over 50% of the US population over the age of 75-y have mild to severe forms of AD. Therefore we recommend that risk assessment for a potential AD risk from space radiation should focus on the projection of an earlier age of onset of AD and the prevention of this possible acceleration through countermeasures. In the two-hit model, oxidative stress and aberrant cell cycle-related abnormalities leading to amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are necessary and invariant steps in AD. We have formulated a stochastic cell kinetics model of the two-hit AD model. In our model a population of neuronal cells is allowed to undergo renewal through neurogenesis and is susceptible to oxidative stress or cell cycle abnormalities with age-specific accumulation of damage. Baseline rates are fitted to AD population data for specific ages, gender, and for persons with an apolipoprotein 4 allele. We then explore how low LET or heavy ions may increase either of the two-hits or neurogenesis either through persistent oxidative stress, direct mutation, or through changes to the micro-environment, and suggest possible ways to develop accurate quantitative estimates of these processes for predicting AD risks following long-term space travel.","[{""submissionId"":20090015364,""id"":""39f0d5a4087a4aaca8a3778e039cc837"",""publicationDate"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Germany"",""submissionId"":20090015364,""endDate"":""2009-07-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Heavy Ions in Therapy and Space Symposium 2009"",""location"":""COlogne"",""id"":""82c989ff7d6b454eaa1e07aed4555600"",""startDate"":""2009-07-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Radiation""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090015364

The goal of the program is to support NASA mission to achieve a safe space travel for humans despite the perils of space radiation. The program focuses on selected topics in radiation biology that were deemed important throughout this period of time, both for the NASA human space flight program and to academic radiation research. Besides scientific support to develop strategies protecting humans against an exposure to deep space radiation during space missions, and understanding health effects from space radiation on astronauts, other important ramifications of the ionizing radiation were studied with the applicability to greater human needs: understanding the origins of cancer, the impact on human genome, and the application of computer technology to biological research addressing the health of general population. The models under NASARTI project include: the general properties of ionizing radiation, such as particular track structure, the effects of radiation on human DNA, visualization and the statistical properties of DSBs (DNA double-strand breaks), DNA damage and repair pathways models and cell phenotypes, chromosomal aberrations, microscopy data analysis and the application to human tissue damage and cancer models. The development of the GUI and the interactive website, as deliverables to NASA operations teams and tools for a broader research community, is discussed.

19910029449,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Radiation biology of HZE particles,"[""Nelson, Gregory A.""]","The biological effects of heavy charged particle (HZE) radiation are of particular interest to travellers and planners for long duration space flights where exposure levels represent a potential health hazard. The unique feature of HZE radiation is the structured pattern of its energy deposition in targets which may be related to charge, velocity, or rate of energy loss. There are many consequences of this feature to biological endpoints when compared to effects of ionizing photons. Dose vs response and dose rate kinetics are modified, DNA and cellular repair systems are altered in their abilities to cope with damage and, the qualitative features of damage are unique for different ions. These features must be incorporated into any risk assessment system for radiation health management. HZE induced mutation, cell inactivation and altered organogenesis will be discussed emphasizing studies with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and cultured cells. Observations from radiobiology experiments in space will also be reviewed along with plans for future space-based studies.","[{""submissionId"":19910029449,""id"":""8db265e2b6eb438d9fd65dc195cebc26"",""publicationDate"":""1990-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19910029449

20230001781,POSTER,"A Multi-Sensor, Low Volume, Automated Culture System for Space Biology Experiments","[""D Walsh"",""N Schmidt"",""S Santa Maria"",""D Gentry""]","Optical density (absorbance) is commonly used in microbiology to measure cell concentration and other colorimetric indicators. It is the main type of bioscience data returned from the BioSentinel small spacecraft mission, which was recently launched as a secondary payload on Artemis I. The flight unit takes absorbance measurements of yeast cultures at 570 nm, 630 nm, and 850 nm to track cell concentration and oxidation-reduction (redox) state of the metabolic indicator dye alamarBlue over time [1]. 

Because the data returned from a small spacecraft mission is necessarily limited, BioSentinel uses a specialized ground-based experiment apparatus to map the absorbance data onto several other parameters.  This culture apparatus is composed of a polycarbonate base and lid which contain ports for several commercial sensors, including a standard 12 mm dissolved oxygen probe, gaseous CO2, fluid pressure, and two micro-probes for measuring pH and redox potential. It also contains a pressure relief valve, a rubber membrane for culture interaction, and a 12mm port for the custom optical probe designed to match in-flight measurements. Modules in two corners expand the culture volume into narrow columns, enabling solid-state optical density measurement and dielectric spectroscopy. The apparatus can be fit to a plate for magnetic stirring.

The apparatus’s optical probe allows mapping between the flight unit’s optical data and the additional parameters measured by the ground-based experiments. Within the probe, a linear actuator pulls a plunger, drawing culture volume into the optical path. The actuator then pushes out the plunger and culture volume, cleaning any stray yeast from the inside surface of the probe. The probe chassis is 3D-printed from biocompatible resin with the optoelectronics cured inside an optically clear conformal coat which functions as a lens. 

To optimize the probe’s dimensions, including optical path, a test harness was developed to manipulate and measure distance while the LED light sources and photodiode detector are in operation. The test harness was composed of two 3/64” thick polycarbonate plates mounted to a set of calipers. The LEDs and photodiode were mounted on the outside of each plate. A cuvette of sample fluid was then clamped between the plates in line between the LEDs and photodiode.

The test harness generated a 78% signal change between water and a dye standard for the green (570 nm) LED, a 90% signal change for the red (630 nm) LED, and a 25% signal change between water and overgrown yeast for the infrared (850 nm) LED. 

The improvements to the ground experiment apparatus (culture volume reduction, inclusion of an optical probe to measure flight-like optical data, and magnetic stirring for culture homogeneity) allow for more flight-like measurements to be taken and more accurate mapping of these additional parameters to the optical data returned from the flight unit.  This enhancement to mission science return will give insight into how deep space radiation may affect human biology for future long-term space exploration.","[{""submissionId"":20230001781,""id"":""fe863337cb974537b7a8872f4d26f15d"",""publicationDate"":""2023-08-05T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230001781,""endDate"":""2023-08-10T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""985c4ef7f20157459c93bed7a92b0dbe"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Utah State University"",""location"":""Logan, Utah, United States""}},""meetingId"":""52453e1213eb405ebfd9a4bf6e5fb88d"",""id"":""a88cba73e0d04296ba5ba1de62d50886""}],""name"":""37th Annual Small Satellite Conference"",""location"":""Logan, UT"",""id"":""52453e1213eb405ebfd9a4bf6e5fb88d"",""url"":""https://smallsat.org/conference"",""startDate"":""2023-08-05T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Instrumentation and Photography""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230001781
20230016450,POSTER,AMMPER: a user-friendly agent-based model that recapitulates simple metabolic responses of yeast to deep-space radiation,"[""Jessica A Lee"",""Daniel Palacios"",""Amrita Singh"",""Madeline V Marous"",""Pramesh Sharma"",""Lauren Liddell"",""Diana Gentry"",""Sergio Santa Maria""]","For humans venturing to deep space, radiation exposure poses a major health risk. Fundamental research into the biological effects of space radiation are essential for enabling exploration, and the first experimental organisms we send to deep space will be microbial. Yet there are many ways in which microorganisms are likely to experience the effects of high-energy particle radiation (such as Galactic Cosmic Rays) differently from multicellular animals, partly due to the simple fact that microbes are small and unicellular-- less likely to get hit in the first place, and less likely to communicate damage between cells. Computational modeling can aid in designing experiments and predicting the biological effects of radiation, but thus far particle radiation models have not focused on microbes.

Here we present the latest developments in AMMPER, the Agent-based Model for Microbial Populations Exposed to Radiation. Originally written in 2021, AMMPER is a Python-based model that incorporates radiation track data from NASA's RITRACKS software and simulates the growth, damage, and death of yeast cells in 3D. It is now freely available as an open-source package on NASA's GitHub repository. Recent improvements include the ability to simulate the dynamics of alamarBlue, a color-changing redox dye commonly used to track metabolic activity in microbial spaceflight experiments. We demonstrate that a simple blue-pink-clear transition model is able to recapitulate key features observed in empirical data from ground studies. AMMPER also includes a new graphical user interface and introductory tutorial to facilitate ease of use by a wider audience. AMMPER can help us to understand how spatially heterogeneous particle radiation damage at the single-cell level can translate to growth differences at the population level, ultimately allowing us to better interpret experiments using microbes as model organisms and how well their results apply to humans.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230016450,""endDate"":""2023-11-18T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""11ea8a263ca548388e8ef57f817352fb"",""id"":""4d334bf347f248349aba6352117ecf6a""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) "",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""11ea8a263ca548388e8ef57f817352fb"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2023-meeting/"",""startDate"":""2023-11-14T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""698671.02.01.85"",""NNA14AB82C"",""AMESVE10012012""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230016450

Walsh"",""Christopher E. Mason"",""Jonathan Schisler"",""Peter Grabham"",""Afshin Beheshti""]","From our earlier work, we demonstrated a circulating microRNA (miRNA) signature that is present and involved with the general increased health risks during spaceflight. From this work we demonstrated that this miRNA signature impacted the overall biology and health with both the microgravity and space radiation components of the space environment. We showed that this miRNA signature can be an optimal biomarker for health risk and also has potential to be utilized as a countermeasure to mitigate the damage caused by the space environment by utilizing a human 3D microvascular tissue model. By applying a novel self-delivery system to target   3   miRNAs   (i.e.   antagomirs)   from   our   spaceflight   miRNA   signature   impacting cardiovascular health risks, we were able to completely mitigate damage caused by exposure to simulated   Galactic   Cosmic   Ray   (GCR)   irradiation.   Here   we   further   expand   on   the countermeasure   experiments   to   uncover   the   specific   novel   biology   involved   with   this countermeasure and  in vivo  experiments that demonstrates that these antagomirs rescue damage caused to certain organs due to both microgravity and space radiation. Specifically, the miRNAs rescued damage to the heart and immune suppression that occurred in addition to other key biology. In addition, we have also observed with the 3D microvascular tissue model improved DNA double strand break repair machinery which can also contribute to improved recovery and protection against damage caused by space radiation. This work expands on our previous work and further uncovers how a potential minimally invasive countermeasure can be used to mitigate space environment effects.

The International Space Station (ISS) will add substantially to this number and significantly increase average lifetime doses. We review these exposures in this report. After many years of investigation, the method used to assess risk have not changed significantly. However, molecular biology and genetics have made enormous progress in establishing the mechanisms of cancer formation, damage to the central nervous system, and individual variation in sensitivity to radiation. We discuss critical questions and possible new approaches to the prediction of risk from space radiation exposures. Experimental models can lead to testable theories that along with extensive biophysical and informatics approaches, will lead to fame and fortune by allowing for accurate projections of astronaut risks and for the development of biological countermeasures.","[{""volume"":""17 Suppl 1"",""submissionId"":20040088561,""issn"":""1120-1797"",""id"":""c2347f3b60c448539945c2c86809d4ba"",""publicationName"":""Physica medica :  PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088561

20020048310,ABSTRACT,Cancer Risk Assessment for Space Radiation,"[""Richmond, Robert C."",""Curreri, Peter A.""]","Predicting the occurrence of human cancer following exposure to any agent causing genetic damage is a difficult task. This is because the uncertainty of uniform exposure to the damaging agent, and the uncertainty of uniform processing of that damage within a complex set of biological variables, degrade the confidence of predicting the delayed expression of cancer as a relatively rare event within any given clinically normal individual. The radiation health research priorities for enabling long-duration human exploration of space were established in the 1996 NRC Report entitled ""Radiation Hazards to Crews of Interplanetary Missions: Biological Issues and Research Strategies"". This report emphasized that a 15-fold uncertainty in predicting radiation-induced cancer incidence must be reduced before NASA can commit humans to extended interplanetary missions. That report concluded that the great majority of this uncertainty is biologically based, while a minority is physically based due to uncertainties in radiation dosimetry and radiation transport codes. Since that report, the biologically based uncertainty has remained large, and the relatively small uncertainty associated with radiation dosimetry has increased due to the considerations raised by concepts of microdosimetry. In a practical sense, however, the additional uncertainties introduced by microdosimetry are encouraging since they are in a direction of lowered effective dose absorbed through infrequent interactions of any given cell with the high energy particle component of space radiation. The biological uncertainty in predicting cancer risk for space radiation derives from two primary facts. 1) One animal tumor study has been reported that includes a relevant spectrum of particle radiation energies, and that is the Harderian gland model in mice. Fact #1: Extension of cancer risk from animal models, and especially from a single study in an animal model, to humans is inherently uncertain. 2) One human database is predominantly used for assessing cancer risk caused by space radiation, and that is the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Fact #2: The atomic-bomb-survivor database, itself a remarkable achievement, contains uncertainties. These include the actual exposure to each individual, the radiation quality of that exposure, and the fact that the exposure was to acute doses of predominantly low-LET radiation, not to chronic exposures of high-LET radiation expected on long-duration interplanetary manned missions.","[{""submissionId"":20020048310,""id"":""8ef5158b3f6c46228e197529994369ae"",""publicationDate"":""2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20020048310,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""4bf0b85c8887499ba296f618aec8f792"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Spelman Coll."",""location"":""Atlanta, GA United States""}},""meetingId"":""f09d2c3c2720489da5cf8cdc2c87674d"",""id"":""d5573f1a5c644d3faaabc8c0ec268e66""}],""name"":""Spelman College RIMI/Biology Seminar Series"",""location"":""Atlanta, GA"",""id"":""f09d2c3c2720489da5cf8cdc2c87674d"",""startDate"":""2002-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020048310

Looking ahead to future long duration crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit, the ability to study how factors including CO2 levels, light cycle, temperature modulate the response to ionizing radiation and microgravity is essential. To date, access to these data has been fragmented across space agencies, spacecraft, and databases. To address this issue, NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) has developed a user interface for interrogation of telemetry data: the Environmental Data Application (EDA).

The EDA provides the capability to visualize telemetry and radiation data collected on the International Space Station and corresponding ground platforms during the Rodent Research missions. Telemetry data includes temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 levels. Radiation data includes galactic cosmic rays, the contribution of the South Atlantic Anomaly, total radiation dose rate, and accumulated radiation dose. The application allows users to view single missions, compare multiple missions, and view and download summary or full data tables.

In summary, the EDA provides GUIs for data visualization and exploration, as well as means for data export, making these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), complementing the biological data contained in OSDR, and providing the space science community with a valuable resource for scientific analyses.",[],"[{""country"":""KR"",""submissionId"":20240008072,""endDate"":""2024-07-21T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""4b26f911a19059f4a80294ec44e8dc3d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute"",""location"":""Daejeon, South Korea""}},""meetingId"":""8ceb3024b8f4463b84fa0c2cf7978765"",""id"":""3ef83865956b470e8ab79b009e18bca6""}],""name"":""45th Scientific Assembly Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) "",""location"":""Busan"",""id"":""8ceb3024b8f4463b84fa0c2cf7978765"",""url"":""https://cospar2024.org/"",""startDate"":""2024-07-13T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.06.01.02.01.02""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240008072

Sanders""]","A key science goal of the NASA “Moon to Mars” campaign is to understand how biology responds to the Lunar, Martian, and deep space environments in order to advance fundamental knowledge, reduce risk, and support safe, productive human space missions. Through the powerful emerging computer science approaches of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), a paradigm shift has begun in biomedical science and engineered astronaut health systems, to enable Earth-independence and autonomy of mission operations. We present a decadal view of AI/ML architecture to support deep space mission goals, developed in concert with leaders in the field. We describe current AI/ML methods to support 1) fundamental biology, 2) in situ analytics, 3) high performance computing hardware, 4) automated science, 5) self-driving labs, 6) remote data management, 7) integrated real-time mission biomonitoring, and 8) a Precision Space Health system. Cutting-edge AI/ML approaches that can be integrated to support these domains include active learning, explainable AI, adaptive learning, causal inference, knowledge graphs, federated learning, transfer learning, and large language models. Finally, we present results from several current ML projects that are underway in the field to address key challenges of small sample n, high feature count, heterogeneity, and sparse data. These include 1) connecting omics data to phenotypic data using an ensemble model to infer causality of spaceflight rodent liver health disruption, 2) usage of explainable ML to interrogate the muscular underpinnings of spaceflight muscle atrophy, 3) ML models analyzing and determining directed acyclic graphs of human space health risk leveraging rodent bone datasets, 4) usage of large pre-trained models connecting biomedical knowledgebases with small spaceflight datasets to understand gene-to-gene interaction networks, and 5) a suite of benchmarked open science datasets (spaceflight mouse liver; radiation DNA damage) enabling programmers to identify the best ML algorithms to answer space biological science questions.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230015678,""endDate"":""2024-03-24T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""16e9adc4cde157588f427d84ee616885"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Brown University"",""location"":""Providence, Rhode Island, United States""}},""meetingId"":""518dddb6d2ec4e879d2b2f5aa336dc3d"",""id"":""bc7797e34a2442089d7845da511b1c85""}],""name"":""Industrialization of SciML"",""location"":""Providence, RI"",""id"":""518dddb6d2ec4e879d2b2f5aa336dc3d"",""url"":""https://icerm.brown.edu/events/htw-24-sciml/#"",""startDate"":""2024-03-23T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""},{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230015678,""endDate"":""2023-11-18T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9196578469af40089abd7559cd053c06"",""id"":""7a90357b8fa045b28c9ea945a2042775""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Washington D.C."",""id"":""9196578469af40089abd7559cd053c06"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2023-meeting/"",""startDate"":""2023-11-14T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.06.01.02.01.02"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine"",""Cybernetics, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics""]","[{""id"":20230009766,""title"":""Biological Research and Space Health Enabled by Machine Learning to Support Deep Space Missions""},{""id"":20230009766,""title"":""Biological Research and Space Health Enabled by Machine Learning to Support Deep Space Missions""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230015678

20070005800,ABSTRACT,Anti-radiation vaccine: Immunologically-based Prophylaxis of Acute Toxic Radiation Syndromes Associated with Long-term Space Flight,"[""Popov, Dmitri"",""Maliev, Vecheslav"",""Jones, Jeffrey"",""Casey, Rachael C.""]","Protecting crew from ionizing radiation is a key life sciences problem for long-duration space missions. The three major sources/types of radiation are found in space: galactic cosmic rays, trapped Van Allen belt radiation, and solar particle events. All present varying degrees of hazard to crews; however, exposure to high doses of any of these types of radiation ultimately induce both acute and long-term biological effects. High doses of space radiation can lead to the development of toxicity associated with the acute radiation syndrome (ARS) which could have significant mission impact, and even render the crew incapable of performing flight duties. The creation of efficient radiation protection technologies is considered an important target in space radiobiology, immunology, biochemistry and pharmacology. Two major mechanisms of cellular, organelle, and molecular destruction as a result of radiation exposure have been identified: 1) damage induced directly by incident radiation on the macromolecules they encounter and 2) radiolysis of water and generation of secondary free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce chemical bond breakage, molecular substitutions, and damage to biological molecules and membranes. Free-radical scavengers and antioxidants, which neutralize the damaging activities of ROS, are effective in reducing the impact of small to moderate doses of radiation. In the case of high doses of radiation, antioxidants alone may be inadequate as a radioprotective therapy. However, it remains a valuable component of a more holistic strategy of prophylaxis and therapy. High doses of radiation directly damage biological molecules and modify chemical bond, resulting in the main pathological processes that drive the development of acute radiation syndromes (ARS). Which of two types of radiation-induced cellular lethality that ultimately develops, apoptosis or necrosis, depends on the spectrum of incident radiation, dose, dose rate, and functional conditions of impacted cells/organisms. The administration of an experimental anti-radiation vaccine may provide an immunologically based, adjunct method of prevention or prophylaxis against clinical ARS. The administration of experimental anti-radiation serum (ARS) and the use of the blood dialysis methods, such as immune plasma-sorption, may assist in the clearance of radiation-specific toxins and may enhance established strategies for the mitigation of the biological effects leading to ARS, and should be evaluated for use on exploration-class space missions.","[{""submissionId"":20070005800,""id"":""4089d1518bff4af5ba8b5f4e2df04162"",""publicationDate"":""2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Russia"",""submissionId"":20070005800,""endDate"":""2007-01-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""3rd International Symposium, Problems in Space Biology"",""location"":""Moscow"",""id"":""684762bb3c3746c39f968739302ad6d3"",""startDate"":""2007-01-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070005800
20120001507,CONFERENCE_PAPER,A Hypothesis on Biological Protection from Space Radiation Through the Use of New Therapeutic Gases,"[""Schoenfeld, Michael P."",""Ansari, Rafat R."",""Nakao, Atsunori"",""Wink, David""]","Radiation exposure to astronauts could be a significant obstacle for long duration manned space exploration because of current uncertainties regarding the extent of biological effects. Furthermore, concepts for protective shielding also pose a technically challenging issue due to the nature of cosmic radiation and current mass and power constraints with modern exploration technology. The concern regarding exposure to cosmic radiation is the biological damage it induces. As damage is associated with increased oxidative stress, it is important and would be enabling to mitigate and/or prevent oxidative stress prior to the development of clinical symptoms and disease. This paper hypothesizes a ""systems biology"" approach in which a combination of chemical and biological mitigation techniques are used conjunctively. It proposes using new, therapeutic, medical gases as both chemical radioprotectors for radical scavenging and biological signaling molecules for management of the body s response to exposure. From reviewing radiochemistry of water, biological effects of CO, H2, NO, and H2S gas, and mechanisms of radiation biology, it is concluded that this approach may have great therapeutic potential for radiation exposure. Furthermore, it also appears to have similar potential for curtailing the pathogenesis of other diseases in which oxidative stress has been implicated including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic inflammatory disease, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, Parkinson s and Alzheimer s disease, cataracts, and aging.","[{""submissionId"":20120001507,""id"":""ea716d6ec2bb46ecbcddbf0e7f05acc4"",""publicationDate"":""2011-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20120001507,""endDate"":""2011-10-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency"",""location"":""Arlington, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b1cfc107a79541d8a551b7d2ddf530f8"",""id"":""1f5200211ea54a67a6a6d44c44ff745c""},{""organizationId"":""6facedfa9b014317bb9b9579340b15ae"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b1cfc107a79541d8a551b7d2ddf530f8"",""id"":""889815254e9347b4b68dd6762e1d433c""}],""name"":""100 year Starship Study"",""location"":""Orlando, FL"",""id"":""b1cfc107a79541d8a551b7d2ddf530f8"",""startDate"":""2011-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120001507
20040141712,REPRINT,Combined effects of space flight factors and radiation on humans,"[""Todd, P."",""Pecaut, M. J."",""Fleshner, M."",""Clarkson, T. W.""]","The probability that a dose of ionizing radiation kills a cell is about 10,000 times the probability that the cell will be transformed to malignancy. On the other hand, the number of cells killed required to significantly impact health is about 10,000 times the number that must be transformed to cause a late malignancy. If these two risks, cell killing and malignant transformation, are about equal, then the risk that occurs during a mission is more significant than the risk that occurs after a mission. The latent period for acute irradiation effects (cell killing) is about 2-4 weeks; the latent period for malignancy is 10-20 years. If these statements are approximately true, then the impact of cell killing on health in the low-gravity environment of space flight should be examined to establish an estimate of risk. The objective of this study is to synthesize data and conclusions from three areas of space biology and environmental health to arrive at rational risk assessment for radiations received by spacecraft crews: (1) the increased physiological demands of the space flight environment; (2) the effects of the space flight environment on physiological systems; and (3) the effects of radiation on physiological systems. One physiological system has been chosen: the immune response and its components, consisting of myeloid and lymphoid proliferative cell compartments. Best-case and worst-case scenarios are considered. In the worst case, a doubling of immune-function demand, accompanied by a halving of immune capacity, would reduce the endangering dose to a crew member to around 1 Gy.","[{""volume"":""430"",""submissionId"":20040141712,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0027-5107"",""id"":""ac18345b226a44939a1065024db677c1"",""publicationName"":""Mutation research"",""publicationDate"":""1999-12-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""RO1 CA35370""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040141712
20190002841,PRESENTATION,GeneLab: A Systems Biology Platform for Omics Analysis,"[""Costes, Sylvain V.""]","NASA's GeneLab includes an open-access repository of some 200+ omics datasets generated by biological experiments relevant to spaceflight (including simulated cosmic radiation and microgravity). In order to maximize the intelligibility of these data, particularly for users with limited bioinformatics knowledge, GeneLab is now transforming the data in the repository into actual biological and physiological knowledge of the genetic and proteomic signatures found in these samples. This processed data is being derived by establishing standard data analysis workflows vetted by 114 scientists who are members of the four GeneLab Analysis Working Groups (Animal AWG, Plant AWG, Microbe AWG, Multi-Omics AWG). AWG members from institutes spanning the U.S. and four other countries participate on a voluntary basis. The AWGs meet monthly to discuss data mining, compare results and interpretations, and test forthcoming releases of the GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS). GLDS version 3.0 has been available to the general public since October 1st 2018, and has been providing a professional state-of-the-art bioinformatics platform for everyone in the space biology community to upload their data into a space biology omics data commons, to process their data with vetted standard workflows and to compare to existing analyses. The user interface for the platform is being designed to be accessible to a broad variety of users including those with limited bioinformatics experience, including high school and college students who can use it to learn about omics data analysis and space biology. As such, Genelab will constitute a powerful general public outreach capability of NASA and the Space Biology community at large. Data mining of the GeneLab database by the AWG has already started generating very interesting findings, including reports linking specific spaceflight conditions such as radiation, microgravity or carbon dioxide levels to molecular changes seen across various species. In this presentation, we will report on the current and future objectives for GeneLab, and review recent studies reported by the various AWGs relating molecular changes observed in various animal models and tissue with microgravity, radiation, circadian rhythm, hydration and carbon dioxide conditions.","[{""submissionId"":20190002841,""id"":""b0975ac02d1241cb9d59f40557009237"",""publicationDate"":""2019-04-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190002841,""name"":""NASA Ames Research Center"",""location"":""Moffett Field, CA, United States"",""id"":""5e7294ebb6c944c18e7ea19898b54e9c""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190002841,""endDate"":""2019-04-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Ames Research Center"",""location"":""Moffett Field, CA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""80f5ee0e4e294c6082f82bcdacee0123"",""id"":""6484240f2ffc4f71a39a1d2116d44d5b""}],""name"":""VWG Workshop"",""location"":""Cambridge, MA"",""id"":""80f5ee0e4e294c6082f82bcdacee0123"",""startDate"":""2019-04-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Exobiology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190002841

The question of the origin of terrestrial life from spores carried through the interstellar medium is examined, and the unlikelihood of the survival of such spores except within meteorites or dust particles is pointed out. Studies of organic molecules present in the interstellar medium are indicated as evidence that the conditions necessary for the formation of life can exist in various locations throughout the universe. Investigations of the molecular evolution of life on earth and of life under extreme conditions of heat, cold, drought and ultraviolet radiation, and of the organic compounds found in meteorites and comets are also discussed.

These data are of vast importance to space biology research, as ionizing radiation affects living organisms—astronauts and non-human experiment subjects alike—placing them at higher risk of carcinogenesis, degenerative diseases, and radiation sickness. Therefore, knowledge of the biological effects of space radiation is essential for planning future crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit. The RadLab project, initiated by GeneLab and ALSDA (the Open Science Data Repository; OSDR) and sponsored by the NASA Human Research Program, is a new effort aimed at connecting dosimetry data from radiation detectors located on the International Space Station (ISS), as well as other spacecraft. To date, access to these data has been fragmented across space agencies and databases; to address this issue, we have developed an application programming interface (API) and an associated graphical user interface (GUI) designed to provide a single point of access to the data. As of now, OSDR has focused on the detectors located on the ISS, with the long-term goal to establish a self-sustained portal receiving continuous updates through APIs connecting to multiple radiation databases of varying scope, as well as individual investigator contributions. The RadLab API implements a request syntax enabling users to query data by craft, sensor type, timespan, etc, allowing for arbitrary combinations of original source data, thus providing programmatic access for use in computational pipelines, while the GUI facilitates data visualization and exploration, making these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), complementing the biological data contained in OSDR, and providing the space science community with a valuable resource for scientific analyses.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230014315,""endDate"":""2024-02-16T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington, United States""}},""meetingId"":""2a967b4c5a7c4cf6a46a0e2f36e0ab3a"",""id"":""b40002d9f97b4a1ba4c26eb8d5f446f4""}],""name"":""Human Research Program-Investigators Working Group (HRP-IWG) Workshop "",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""2a967b4c5a7c4cf6a46a0e2f36e0ab3a"",""url"":""https://www.edgereg.net/er/EventHomePage/CustomPage.jsp?ActivityID=42008&ItemID=137127 "",""startDate"":""2024-02-13T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.06.01.02.01.02"",""80NSSC18M0060"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230014315
20040087980,REPRINT,Models to study gravitational biology of Mammalian reproduction,"[""Tou, Janet"",""Ronca, April"",""Grindeland, Richard"",""Wade, Charles""]","Mammalian reproduction evolved within Earth's 1-g gravitational field. As we move closer to the reality of space habitation, there is growing scientific interest in how different gravitational states influence reproduction in mammals. Habitation of space and extended spaceflight missions require prolonged exposure to decreased gravity (hypogravity, i.e., weightlessness). Lift-off and re-entry of the spacecraft are associated with exposure to increased gravity (hypergravity). Existing data suggest that spaceflight is associated with a constellation of changes in reproductive physiology and function. However, limited spaceflight opportunities and confounding effects of various nongravitational factors associated with spaceflight (i.e., radiation, stress) have led to the development of ground-based models for studying the effects of altered gravity on biological systems. Human bed rest and rodent hindlimb unloading paradigms are used to study exposure to hypogravity. Centrifugation is used to study hypergravity. Here, we review the results of spaceflight and ground-based models of altered gravity on reproductive physiology. Studies utilizing ground-based models that simulate hyper- and hypogravity have produced reproductive results similar to those obtained from spaceflight and are contributing new information on biological responses across the gravity continuum, thereby confirming the appropriateness of these models for studying reproductive responses to altered gravity and the underlying mechanisms of these responses. Together, these unique tools are yielding new insights into the gravitational biology of reproduction in mammals.","[{""volume"":""67"",""submissionId"":20040087980,""issue"":""6"",""issn"":""0006-3363"",""id"":""fde37c15f27b494388c97dccbc19af72"",""publicationName"":""Biology of reproduction"",""publicationDate"":""2002-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""46485""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040087980
20040073493,OTHER,Cell Science and Cell Biology Research at MSFC: Summary,undefined,"The common theme of these research programs is that they investigate regulation of gene expression in cells, and ultimately gene expression is controlled by the macromolecular interactions between regulatory proteins and DNA. The NASA Critical Path Roadmap identifies Muscle Alterations and Atrophy and Radiation Effects as Very Serious Risks and Severe Risks, respectively, in long term space flights. The specific problem addressed by Dr. Young's research (""Skeletal Muscle Atrophy and Muscle Cell Signaling"") is that skeletal muscle loss in space cannot be prevented by vigorous exercise. Aerobic skeletal muscles (i.e., red muscles) undergo the most extensive atrophy during long-term space flight. Of the many different potential avenues for preventing muscle atrophy, Dr. Young has chosen to study the beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) pathway. The reason for this choice is that a family of compounds called betaAR agonists will preferentially cause an increase in muscle mass of aerobic muscles (i.e., red muscle) in animals, potentially providing a specific pharmacological solution to muscle loss in microgravity. In addition, muscle atrophy is a widespread medical problem in neuromuscular diseases, spinal cord injury, lack of exercise, aging, and any disease requiring prolonged bedridden status. Skeletal muscle cells in cell culture are utilized as a model system to study this problem. Dr. Richmond's research (""Radiation & Cancer Biology of Mammary Cells in Culture"") is directed toward developing a laboratory model for use in risk assessment of cancer caused by space radiation. This research is unique because a human model will be developed utilizing human mammary cells that are highly susceptible to tumor development. This approach is preferential over using animal cells because of problems in comparing radiation-induced cancers between humans and animals.","[{""submissionId"":20040073493,""id"":""de9ba2cdae444866b315907683de6f75"",""publicationName"":""Biological and Physical Space Research Laboratory 2002 Science Review"",""publicationDate"":""2003-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20040073490,""title"":""Biological and Physical Space Research Laboratory 2002 Science Review""},{""id"":20040073490,""title"":""Biological and Physical Space Research Laboratory 2002 Science Review""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040073493
20140000698,ABSTRACT,"NASA Models of Space Radiation Induced Cancer, Circulatory Disease, and Central Nervous System Effects","[""Cucinotta, Francis A."",""Chappell, Lori J."",""Kim, Myung-Hee Y.""]","The risks of late effects from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE) are potentially a limitation to long-term space travel. The late effects of highest concern have significant lethality including cancer, effects to the central nervous system (CNS), and circulatory diseases (CD). For cancer and CD the use of age and gender specific models with uncertainty assessments based on human epidemiology data for low LET radiation combined with relative biological effectiveness factors (RBEs) and dose- and dose-rate reduction effectiveness factors (DDREF) to extrapolate these results to space radiation exposures is considered the current ""state-of-the-art"". The revised NASA Space Risk Model (NSRM-2014) is based on recent radio-epidemiology data for cancer and CD, however a key feature of the NSRM-2014 is the formulation of particle fluence and track structure based radiation quality factors for solid cancer and leukemia risk estimates, which are distinct from the ICRP quality factors, and shown to lead to smaller uncertainties in risk estimates. Many persons exposed to radiation on earth as well as astronauts are life-time never-smokers, which is estimated to significantly modify radiation cancer and CD risk estimates. A key feature of the NASA radiation protection model is the classification of radiation workers by smoking history in setting dose limits. Possible qualitative differences between GCR and low LET radiation increase uncertainties and are not included in previous risk estimates. Two important qualitative differences are emerging from research studies. The first is the increased lethality of tumors observed in animal models compared to low LET radiation or background tumors. The second are Non- Targeted Effects (NTE), which include bystander effects and genomic instability, which has been observed in cell and animal models of cancer risks. NTE's could lead to significant changes in RBE and DDREF estimates for GCR particles, and the potential effectiveness of radiation mitigator's. The NSRM- 2014 approaches to model radiation quality dependent lethality and NTE's will be described. CNS effects include both early changes that may occur during long space missions and late effects such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD effects 50% of the population above age 80-yr, is a degenerative disease that worsens with time after initial onset leading to death, and has no known cure. AD is difficult to detect at early stages and the small number of low LET epidemiology studies undertaken have not identified an association with low dose radiation. However experimental studies in mice suggest GCR may lead to early onset AD. We discuss modeling approaches to consider mechanisms whereby radiation would lead to earlier onset of occurrence of AD. Biomarkers of AD include amyloid beta (A(Beta)) plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) made up of aggregates of the hyperphosphorylated form of the micro-tubule associated, tau protein. Related markers include synaptic degeneration, dentritic spine loss, and neuronal cell loss through apoptosis. Radiation may affect these processes by causing oxidative stress, aberrant signaling following DNA damage, and chronic neuroinflammation. Cell types to be considered in multi-scale models are neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. We developed biochemical and cell kinetics models of DNA damage signaling related to glycogen synthase kinase-3(Beta) (GSK3(Beta)) and neuroinflammation, and considered multi-scale modeling approaches to develop computer simulations of cell interactions and their relationships to A(Beta) plaques and NFTs. Comparison of model results to experimental data for the age specific development of A(Beta) plaques in transgenic mice will be discussed.","[{""submissionId"":20140000698,""id"":""e7d35109c95a45e1be1e228ed5c54560"",""publicationDate"":""2013-11-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140000698,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""location"":""Arlington, VA, United States"",""id"":""6c14f17acdfa4de39f517148bcd00af6""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140000698,""endDate"":""2013-11-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""location"":""Arlington, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d1913207d3c2450580170bf8d6b6ffa3"",""id"":""3dcac9327c3d42ad9104105ce23b06a1""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitation and Space Research (ASGSR) Meeting"",""location"":""Orlando, FL"",""id"":""d1913207d3c2450580170bf8d6b6ffa3"",""startDate"":""2013-11-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140000698

Before sending Astronauts for long-duration missions, it is crucial to understand the technological and biomedical countermeasures needed to protect them before they get there.

We can use knowledge gained from biological CubeSats to guide the next generation of experiments to support human habitation on the Moon. Lunar Explorer Instrument for space biology Applications (LEIA) is NASA’s latest BioSensor, adapted BioSentinel, the only CubeSat to travel Beyond Low Earth Orbit. BioSentinel launched on Artemis I and is currently >50 million kilometers from Earth (as of July 2024). 

LEIA aims to identify biological responses to the Lunar environment, which unprotected against would pose a threat to astronauts (cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological impairment). The suite of instruments within LEIA detects Lunar radiation using two on-board radiation sensors (ARES charged particle detector, Mini-Fast Neutron Detector), then monitors real-time biological responses to the Lunar environment via an autonomous microfluidic system, fit with 3-LED emitter and detector boards and the alamarBlue metabolic indicator dye. LEIA will use a genetic approach in addition to synthetic biology to test counter-measure production in space, with the goal to inform and protect astronauts for future Moon missions.

We have conducted preliminary tests in preparation for launch to the anticipated South Pole of the Moon, optimizing the biology (strain down-selection, desiccation tolerance, radiation sensitivity) and improving the hardware (including a blue LED to detect the beta-carotene countermeasure product). Our team will discuss these findings in several parts – an overview of the LEIA mission (Mark Settles), adapting flexible CubeSat platforms for deep-space applications (Sergio Santa Maria, Kira Rienecker), developing new technologies to support LEIA ground studies (Chinmayee Govinda Raj), and yeast strain development and hardware testing in preparation for LEIA (presented here).

20230016227,POSTER,Differential Gene Expression in A Cross-Feeding Two-Species Model Microbial Community Under Simulated Microgravity and Deep-Space Radiation,"[""Jessica L Gonzalez"",""Jessica A Lee""]","A long-term goal of space biology is to understand interspecies microbial interactions in space. Presently, little is known about the combined effect of microgravity and ionizing radiation on bacterial community response when species are interdependent through exchange of metabolites in fluid medium (cross-feeding). Microgravity is expected to slow interspecies mass transfer and growth in cross-feeding communities in the low-shear, diffusion-limited environment, while ionizing radiation may influence stress response to direct (DNA damage) and indirect damage (ROS). Using a well-understood, two-species (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) microbial community engineered to be a model for studying cross-feeding, we simulated galactic cosmic rays (GCRsim) and microgravity to test the hypothesis: exposure to ionizing radiation causes cell damage or stress, altering transcriptomic community responses in metabolically interdependent cells, which is exacerbated by microgravity. We expect to see differential gene expression between cross-feeding and non-cross-feeding communities.
We measured GCRsim effects on growth and gene expression in well-mixed versus simulated-microgravity conditions and in cross-feeding and non-cross-feeding medium. Microbial cultures were inoculated into liquid medium in rotating wall vessels (RWV) with different rotation rates: 5 RPM (simulated microgravity) and 50 RPM (well-mixed). The E. coli-S. enterica consortium, under simulated microgravity, were exposed to 500 mGy of Simplified 5-ion Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulation for 2 hours at Brookhaven National Lab. We harvested samples 40 minutes after irradiation for extraction and sequencing (NASA GeneLab). Here we present the differential gene expression analysis results, which reveal altered transcriptomic community responses, even where growth rate differences are not observed. Gene expression of these actively metabolizing microbial communities in GCRsim may illuminate molecular mechanisms of microbial interactions in space.

Yet unlike orbital spaceflight, it is much faster and cheaper to conduct biology research with balloons, sending specimens to the near space environment of Earth’s stratosphere. Samples can be loaded the morning of a launch and sometimes returned to the laboratory within one day. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) flies large, unmanned scientific balloons from all over globe, with missions ranging from hours to weeks in duration. A payload in the middle portion of the stratosphere (~35 km above sea level) will be exposed to an environment similar to the surface of Mars: temperatures as cold as -100 °C, atmospheric pressure at a thin 0.9 kPa, relative humidity levels < 1%, and a harsh illumination of ultraviolet (UV) and cosmic radiation levels (about 100 W/m<sup>2</sup> and 0.07 mGy/d, respectively) that can be obtained nowhere else on the surface of the Earth, including environmental chambers and particle accelerator facilities attempting to simulate space radiation effects. Considering operational advantages of ballooning and the fidelity of space-like stressors in the stratosphere, researchers in aerobiology, astrobiology, and space biology can benefit from balloon flight experiments as an intermediary step on the extraterrestrial continuum (ground, low Earth orbit, and deep space studies). Our review targets biologists with no background or experience in scientific ballooning.

Crewed exploration of the Moon carries risks of long duration exposure to reduced gravity and to deep space radiation. The Lunar Explorer Instrument for space biology Applications (LEIA) investigates the effects of increased radiation and reduced gravity on yeast viability and growth in a Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) surface mission to the south polar region. LEIA conducts yeast genetics experiments to quantify growth, metabolism, and synthetic biology-enabled production of human nutrients, while taking real time measurements of biologically relevant radiation exposure on the lunar surface. We have engineered beta-carotene producing yeast strains to test the importance of selected DNA damage repair and reactive oxygen species (ROS) defense pathways in mitigating cellular damage from lunar surface radiation. Carotenoids are important dietary antioxidants, and beta-carotene is pro-vitamin A, which is needed for vision and immune function. Carotenoids are sensitive to ROS produced by ionizing radiation and NASA is testing on-demand production of carotenoids from yeast in the BioNutrients space flight experiments. In LEIA, we test the effects of deep space on carotenoid yield in engineered yeast strains. The LEIA team uses CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer yeast to express carotenoids as well as to generate loss-of-function mutations. We are generating mutations in the RAD51 DNA damage repair locus and three genes that function to reduce oxidative damage to the cell: SOD1, SOD2, and TSA1. These strains are tested for carotenoid production using microfluidics and LED spectroscopy to allow remote sensing of cellular growth and carotenoid levels.

The GeneLab Data System (GLDS) is NASA's premier open-access omics data platform for biological experiments. GLDS houses standards-compliant, high-throughput sequencing and other omics data from spaceflight-relevant experiments. The GeneLab project at NASA-Ames Research Center is developing the database, and also partnering with spaceflight projects through sharing or augmentation of experiment samples to expand omics analyses on precious spaceflight samples. The partnerships ensure that the maximum amount of data is garnered from spaceflight experiments and made publically available as rapidly as possible via the GLDS. GLDS Version 1.0, went online in April 2015. Software updates and new data releases occur at least quarterly. As of October 2016, the GLDS contains 80 datasets and has search and download capabilities. Version 2.0 is slated for release in September of 2017 and will have expanded, integrated search capabilities leveraging other public omics databases (NCBI GEO, PRIDE, MG-RAST). Future versions in this multi-phase project will provide a collaborative platform for omics data analysis. Data from experiments that explore the biological effects of the spaceflight environment on a wide variety of model organisms are housed in the GLDS including data from rodents, invertebrates, plants and microbes. Human datasets are currently limited to those with anonymized data (e.g., from cultured cell lines). GeneLab ensures prompt release and open access to high-throughput genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data from spaceflight and ground-based simulations of microgravity, radiation or other space environment factors. The data are meticulously curated to assure that accurate experimental and sample processing metadata are included with each data set. GLDS download volumes indicate strong interest of the scientific community in these data. To date GeneLab has partnered with multiple experiments including two plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) experiments, two mice experiments, and several microbe experiments. GeneLab optimized protocols in the rodent partnerships for maximum yield of RNA, DNA and protein from tissues harvested and preserved during the SpaceX-4 mission, as well as from tissues from mice that were frozen intact during spaceflight and later dissected on the ground. Analysis of GeneLab data will contribute fundamental knowledge of how the space environment affects biological systems, and as well as yield terrestrial benefits resulting from mitigation strategies to prevent effects observed during exposure to space environments.

20160006438,ABSTRACT,"Space Biophysics: Accomplishments, Trends, Challenges","[""Smith, Jeffrey D.""]","Physics and biology are inextricably linked. All the chemical and biological processes of life are dutifully bound to follow the rules and laws of physics. In space, these physical laws seem to turn on their head and biological systems, from microbes to humans, adapt and evolve in myriad ways to cope with the changed physical influences of the space environment. Gravity is the most prominent change in space that influences biology. In microgravity, the physical processes of sedimentation, density-driven convective flow, influence of surface tension and fluid pressure profoundly influence biology at the molecular and cellular level as well as at the whole-body level. Gravity sensing mechanisms are altered, structural and functional components of biology (such as bone and muscle) are reduced and changes in the way fluids and gasses behave also drive the way microbial systems and biofilms grow as well as the way plants and animals adapt. The radiation environment also effects life in space. Solar particle events and high energy cosmic radiation can cause serious damage to DNA and other biomolecules. The results can cause mutation, cellular damage or death, leading to health consequences of acute radiation damage or long-term health consequences such as increased cancer risk. Space Biophysics is the study and utilization of physical changes in space that cause changes in biological systems. The unique physical environment in space has been used successfully to grow high-quality protein crystals and 3D tissue cultures that could not be grown in the presence of unidirectional gravitational acceleration here on Earth. All biological processes that change in space have their root in a biophysical alteration due to microgravity and/or the radiation environment of space. In order to fully-understand the risks to human health in space and to fully-understand how humans, plants, animals and microbes can safely and effectively travel and eventually live for long periods beyond the protective environment of Earth, the biophysical properties underlying these changes must be studied, characterized and understood. This lecture reviews the current state of NASA biophysics research accomplishments and identifies future trends and challenges for biophysics research on the International Space Station and beyond.","[{""submissionId"":20160006438,""id"":""43b302c3f85248e1b9d1a2964bb39c93"",""publicationDate"":""2015-04-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160006438,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""2c51575915fa4ff7bbd82ba95b283640"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Miami Univ."",""location"":""Oxford, OH, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b7fe71a3606a4251b7c026f101214f02"",""id"":""78eab42f41cc43e0afc0b0cede335d00""}],""name"":""Benson Memorial Lecture"",""location"":""Oxford, OH"",""id"":""b7fe71a3606a4251b7c026f101214f02"",""startDate"":""2015-04-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 904211.01.01.30.01""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160006438

20240013666,POSTER,A Heritage BioSensor for Lunar Biology Experiments,"[""Chinmayee Govinda Raj"",""Jessica A Lee"",""Michael R Padgen"",""Antonio J Ricco"",""Linda R Timucin"",""Diana M Gentry"",""S Gilroy"",""Andrew M Settles"",""Sergio R Santa Maria""]","<b>Introduction:</b>  Automated biological experiments on small spacecraft missions have gained prominence over the past decade due to their simplicity, accessibility, and small mass, volume, and power needs. Most recently, the BioSensor microfluidic CubeSat payload aboard BioSentinel used an automated microfluidic cell culture system to study the effects of environmental stressors like deep space radiation and microgravity on yeast growth and metabolism. BioSentinel’s successor, the Lunar Explorer Instrument for space biology Applications (LEIA), will study the effects of lunar gravity and radiation using an improved version of the BioSensor microfluidic platform. The BioSensor payload has great adaptability to host a diverse range of biological experiments with single- and multi-celled organisms in both crewed and uncrewed missions, making it a compelling candidate for future space biology studies in a lunar surface environment.  


<b>BioSensor Instrumentation on BioSentinel:</b> The first spaceflight mission with the BioSensor, BioSentinel’s biology experiments occurred at three locations -- deep space, ISS and ground. The payload contained 18 microfluidic cards, each featuring 16 growth wells (a total of 288 growth wells). Each well was loaded before launch with desiccated yeast. In space, liquid culture medium (nutrients) was automatically introduced to batches of wells at a time to initiate a series of biology experiments. Temperature was maintained by thin film heaters on both sides of each card. Each well was equipped with three LEDs emitting at 570 nm, 630 nm, and 850 nm, paired with photodetectors to measure cell concentration and the alamarBlue (metabolic indicator dye) color transition from blue to pink. Phenotypic parameters like cell viability, metabolic rate, and generation time can be derived from these measurements. The sequence and timing of fluid fills, optical measurements, and thermal control were stored onboard, but could be updated asynchronously via ground communication.   
 

<b>LEIA:</b> LEIA is slated for launch no earlier than 2026 on a CLPS lander. BioSentinel’s BioSensor has been modified for use in LEIA. These improvements include: (a) storage for multiple culture medium types, (b) additional LED color (465 nm) for a new biological assay for antioxidant (carotenoid) production, (c) housing modifications for later biology load before launch, (d) improved isolation between electronic and fluidic components, and (e) improved humidity control for prolonged organism viability in case of post-load launch delay.  
 

<b>Future Prospects:</b> The consistent and successful demonstration of complex fluidics platforms alongside reliable instrument operations in a space environment is poised to create strong momentum for BioSensor-based biological experiment payloads. Planned future developments with the BioSensor include extending compatibility to a broader range of organisms and assays. Preliminary work has already demonstrated successful growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in fluidic cards. With a few modifications to the optical assembly, the setup could easily measure photosynthetic traits in plants and cyanobacteria. The addition of fluorescence measurements and generation of novel luminescent assays will elevate BioSensor’s functionality further. 

Beyond the BioSensor’s potential uses on free-flyer missions, ISS and Gateway, and CLPS landers, deploying the BioSensor to the lunar surface or in an artificial habitat on crewed missions could enable pioneering research on both how life responds to lunar conditions and future bioproduction capabilities making the BioSensor an indispensable tool for future space biology research.

Furthermore, concepts for protective shielding also pose a technically challenging issue due to the nature of cosmic radiation and current mass and power constraints with modern exploration technology. The concern regarding exposure to cosmic radiation is the biological damage it induces. As damage is associated with increased oxidative stress, it is important and would be enabling to mitigate and/or prevent oxidative stress prior to the development of clinical symptoms and disease. This paper hypothesizes a ""systems biology"" approach in which a combination of chemical and biological mitigation techniques are used conjunctively. It proposes using new, therapeutic, medical gases as both chemical radioprotectors for radical scavenging and biological signaling molecules for management of the body s response to exposure. From reviewing radiochemistry of water, biological effects of CO, H2, NO, and H2S gas, and mechanisms of radiation biology, it is concluded that this approach may have great therapeutic potential for radiation exposure. Furthermore, it also appears to have similar potential for curtailing the pathogenesis of other diseases in which oxidative stress has been implicated including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic inflammatory disease, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, Parkinson s and Alzheimer s disease, cataracts, and aging.","[{""submissionId"":20120001492,""id"":""187cc7401a0447cd9ae15491987f4bc7"",""publicationDate"":""2012-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120001492

Resources to support large numbers of spaceflight investigations are limited. NASA's GeneLab project is maximizing the science output from these experiments by: (1) developing a unique public bioinformatics database that includes space bioscience relevant ""omics"" data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) and experimental metadata; (2) partnering with NASA-funded flight experiments through bio-sample sharing or sample augmentation to expedite omics data input to the GeneLab database; and (3) developing community-driven reference flight experiments. The first database, GeneLab Data System Version 1.0, went online in April 2015. V1.0 contains numerous flight datasets and has search and download capabilities. Version 2.0 will be released in 2016 and will link to analytic tools. In 2015 Genelab partnered with two Biological Research in Canisters experiments (BBRIC-19 and BRIC-20) which examine responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to spaceflight. GeneLab also partnered with Rodent Research-1 (RR1), the maiden flight to test the newly developed rodent habitat. GeneLab developed protocols for maxiumum yield of RNA, DNA and protein from precious RR-1 tissues harvested and preserved during the SpaceX-4 mission, as well as from tissues from mice that were frozen intact during spaceflight and later dissected. GeneLab is establishing partnerships with at least three planned flights for 2016. Organism-specific nationwide Science Definition Teams (SDTs) will define future GeneLab dedicated missions and ensure the broader scientific impact of the GeneLab missions. GeneLab ensures prompt release and open access to all high-throughput omics data from spaceflight and ground-based simulations of microgravity and radiation. Overall, GeneLab will facilitate the generation and query of parallel multi-omics data, and deep curation of metadata for integrative analysis, allowing researchers to uncover cellular networks as observed in systems biology platforms. Consequently, the scientific community will have access to a more complete picture of functional and regulatory networks responsive to the spaceflight environment.. Analysis of GeneLab data will contribute fundamental knowledge of how the space environment affects biological systems, and enable emerging terrestrial benefits resulting from mitigation strategies to prevent effects observed during exposure to space. As a result, open access to the data will foster new hypothesis-driven research for future spaceflight studies spanning basic science to translational science.","[{""submissionId"":20160001708,""id"":""295eee513a7847b299b09f7945af244d"",""publicationDate"":""2015-12-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160001708,""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States"",""id"":""1568a71841854450a9269adb1aea0c75""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160001708,""endDate"":""2015-12-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d737116023334676b2e82bfc4fe52cb7"",""id"":""858e9cc6e61f48a78bbb5d257b8cfe05""}],""name"":""2015 Annual American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) Meeting"",""location"":""San Diego, CA"",""id"":""d737116023334676b2e82bfc4fe52cb7"",""startDate"":""2015-12-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NAS2-03144"",""NNA14AB82C"",""NNX10A134A""]",undefined,"[""Space Sciences (General)"",""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160001708

One possible solution to help reduce this risk is the addition of in situ produced supplemental fresh produce to supplement and enhance the astronaut diet.  A number of ground and ISS-based studies are being conducted which are helping to reduce this risk by filling the gaps in knowledge and technology associated with space crop production.   These include studies with the Veggie vegetable production system on the International Space Station.  Key focus areas include water and nutrient delivery, food safety and the crop microbiome, crop selection and testing, automation and robotics, radiation impacts, seed storage and handling, and scalability for different concepts and architectures.  All of these areas have significant challenges that need to be addressed prior to successful integration of crop production into the crew diet.

R."",""Tran, P."",""Skidmore, M.""]","NASA's mission includes expanding our understanding of biological systems to improve life on Earth and to enable long-duration human exploration of space. The GeneLab Data System (GLDS) is NASAs premier open-access omics data platform for biological experiments. GLDS houses standards-compliant, high-throughput sequencing and other omics data from spaceflight-relevant experiments. The GeneLab project at NASA-Ames Research Center is developing the database, and also partnering with spaceflight projects through sharing or augmentation of experiment samples to expand omics analyses on precious spaceflight samples. The partnerships ensure that the maximum amount of data is garnered from spaceflight experiments and made publically available as rapidly as possible via the GLDS. GLDS Version 1.0, went online in April 2015. Software updates and new data releases occur at least quarterly. As of October 2016, the GLDS contains 80 datasets and has search and download capabilities. Version 2.0 is slated for release in September of 2017 and will have expanded, integrated search capabilities leveraging other public omics databases (NCBI GEO, PRIDE, MG-RAST). Future versions in this multi-phase project will provide a collaborative platform for omics data analysis. Data from experiments that explore the biological effects of the spaceflight environment on a wide variety of model organisms are housed in the GLDS including data from rodents, invertebrates, plants and microbes. Human datasets are currently limited to those with anonymized data (e.g., from cultured cell lines). GeneLab ensures prompt release and open access to high-throughput genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data from spaceflight and ground-based simulations of microgravity, radiation or other space environment factors. The data are meticulously curated to assure that accurate experimental and sample processing metadata are included with each data set. GLDS download volumes indicate strong interest of the scientific community in these data. To date GeneLab has partnered with multiple experiments including two plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) experiments, two mice experiments, and several microbe experiments. GeneLab optimized protocols in the rodent partnerships for maximum yield of RNA, DNA and protein from tissues harvested and preserved during the SpaceX-4 mission, as well as from tissues from mice that were frozen intact during spaceflight and later dissected on the ground.

20240015226,POSTER,Metabolic Vessel for Impedance Spectroscopy and Electrochemistry (MVISE): The Ground Mapping Unit for the Lunar Explorer Instrument for Space Biology Applications (LEIA)​,"[""Chinmayee Govinda Raj"",""Kayla Bryant"",""Dunya Shuman"",""Stephen Lantin"",""Sergio Santa Maria"",""Diana Gentry""]","The BioSensor payload on the upcoming LEIA platform aboard a CLPS lander will carry yeast to the moon to study response to radiation and lunar gravity. The LEIA BioSensor is designed to monitor metabolic activity using absorbance in conjunction with alamarBlue for measuring colorimetric changes as proxy measurement for redox potential. The science data returned from small spacecraft mission modules like LEIA is limited as it relies solely on optical measurements, necessitating a corresponding ground mapping unit that is equipped with multiple electrochemical sensors for accurate mapping of the optical data and operates fully automatically.  

This technology development work discusses the extensive design and optimization efforts put into the ground mapping unit, MVISE. MVISE is a custom designed, 3D-printed vessel with an agitation system, with six different electrochemical sensor probes, and ports for sample collection and a pressure release valve. The sensors provide real-time data, with dry absorbance measurements aligning with LEIA flight hardware and wet measurements demonstrating invasive sensor design enabling a comparison between the two setups. 

The 3D printer resin was tested for mechanical robustness, biocompatibility, and resistance to autoclave sterilization. The inner walls were coated with food-grade epoxy, ensuring a smooth finish to prevent microbial lodging and dye staining. The MVISE has successfully passed a week-long leak test and is now undergoing active biology tests. The MVISE prototype will be prepared for radiation tests, with three identical units being tested for varying radiation levels and culture compositions at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory in November 2024. 

The integrated sensor approach proposed in this work will enable the accurate mapping of the BioSentinel/LEIA optical flight data to six sensor parameters on the ground unit for better science data return and will enable the first effort to evaluate classical biochemical sensor measurements by comparing and contrasting their responses.

The excess cost to protect against the GCR and SPE due to current uncertainties in radiation transmission properties and cancer biology could be exceedingly large based on the excess launch costs to shield against uncertainties. The development of advanced shielding concepts is an important risk mitigation area with the potential to significantly reduce risk below conventional mission designs. A key issue in spacecraft material selection is the understanding of nuclear reactions on the transmission properties of materials. High-energy nuclear particles undergo nuclear reactions in passing through materials and tissue altering their composition and producing new radiation types. Spacecraft and planetary habitat designers can utilize radiation transport codes to identify optimal materials for lowering exposures and to optimize spacecraft design to reduce astronaut exposures. To reach these objectives will require providing design engineers with accurate data bases and computationally efficient software for describing the transmission properties of space radiation in materials. Our program will reduce the uncertainty in the transmission properties of space radiation by improving the theoretical description of nuclear reactions and radiation transport, and provide accurate physical descriptions of the track structure of microscopic energy deposition.","[{""submissionId"":19990040264,""id"":""7135f89334944b3ead3e80bde30d6fb8"",""publicationName"":""NASA Microgravity Materials Science Conference"",""publicationDate"":""1999-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Spacecraft Design, Testing And Performance""]","[{""id"":19990040241,""title"":""NASA Microgravity Materials Science Conference""},{""id"":19990040241,""title"":""NASA Microgravity Materials Science Conference""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19990040264

Furthermore, concepts for protective shielding also pose a technically challenging issue due to the nature of cosmic radiation and current mass and power constraints with modern exploration technology. As biological damage from exposure is associated with increased oxidative stress, it would be enabling to mitigate and/or prevent stress prior to the development of clinical symptoms and disease. This paper hypothesizes a ""systems biology"" approach in which a combination of chemical and biological mitigation techniques are used conjunctively. It proposes using new, therapeutic, medical gases as both chemical radioprotectors for radical scavenging and biological promoters for management of the body s response to exposure. From reviewing radiochemistry of water, biological effects of CO, H2, NO, and H2S gas, and mechanisms of radiation biology, it is concluded that this approach may have great therapeutic potential for exposure. Furthermore, it also appears to have potential for curtailing the pathogenesis of other diseases in which oxidative stress has been implicated including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic inflammatory disease, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, Parkinson s and Alzheimer s disease, cataracts, and aging.","[{""submissionId"":20120001681,""id"":""6ab6887779c8456d931c09ed72c273fc"",""publicationDate"":""2011-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20120001681,""endDate"":""2011-10-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency"",""location"":""Arlington, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ff7e9a1c3ed44a63bd4ef7c46b5549bc"",""id"":""68b6e31d319f46539e82c333b6b7c895""},{""organizationId"":""6facedfa9b014317bb9b9579340b15ae"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ff7e9a1c3ed44a63bd4ef7c46b5549bc"",""id"":""d9cca9c77f8d49c3802695f8bec38002""}],""name"":""100 year Starship Study"",""location"":""Orlando, FL"",""id"":""ff7e9a1c3ed44a63bd4ef7c46b5549bc"",""startDate"":""2011-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120001681

20230000529,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Data Sharing in Radiobiology; Towards FAIR,"[""Daniel Berrios"",""Luke T. Slater"",""Jack Miller"",""Kristen Peach"",""Sylvain V. Costes"",""Paul N. Schofield""]","The value of scientific data depends on their findability, accessibility, integrability and reusability
according to the FAIR principles. Together with the sustainability of data preservation and access, these
principles underpin the long term benefits of scientific research. Within the domain of radiobiology we
have a huge array of data types, themes and complexities which make standardisation of metadata, data
structure and data integration very challenging. Moreover, it is clear that, for example, in the area of
disaster preparedness, the ready discovery and availability of multiple types of data, for example on
biological effects of exposure, climatology, ecology, human behavioural and attitudinal studies, is
important for an integrated scientific approach.

Because these data are spread over many databases, journal supplementary information resources and
even the computers of the investigators, their discovery and reuse can be challenging. Despite
exhortations from funding agencies and scientific institutions over the past two decades there is still a
serious deficit in the willingness and in some cases the ability of investigators to share data, and although
much may not be formally „Public domain“, information about the existence of the data, their metadata,
and how to obtain them should always be available.

We report the progress of work on three databases, the STORE and the NASA GeneLab and LSDA
repositories to leverage the Radiation Biology Ontology (RBO), a structured terminology for metadata
that can be used by all radiation biology-relevant databases to unite federated and automated data
searches across multiple databases, for example using web services, and through semantic web
technologies supporting data discovery.

The initial primary use-cases for RBO were archiving data in the STORE database
(https://www.storedb.org/), the repository used for the RadoNorm and Pianoforte Projects among others,
and in the NASA Open Science Data Repository (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio). The scope of radiobiology
research ranges from basic physics to radiation oncology to sociolegal studies; no existing ontology had
the necessary breadth or depth to fulfill this need. In addition, a formal ontology has the advantage of
being usable for machine learning and, importantly, for tasks like data integration, knowledge extraction
from the scientific literature and for query extension and data classification. Standardisation of metadata
is one of the primary objectives of the FAIR principles for open data; RBO is an important landmark for
FAIR-compliant radiation biology data sharing.

The RBO is developed using the open-source tools of GitHub and the OBO Foundry-led Ontology
Development Kit, and published through GitHub and the NIH/NCBI BioPortal website. This initial
phase of concept modeling has yielded an ontology that has more than 300 declared concepts, with more
than 3500 additional concepts imported from other OBO Foundry ontologies with relevance to radiation
biology (for example, concepts from the ISO standard Basic Formal Ontology, the Environment
Ontology and the Gene Ontology).

We welcome input into the development of RBO and encourage its adoption.","[{""submissionId"":20230000529,""publisher"":"""",""id"":""1c2dee51fc6b43e9a822ba8cad77b28c"",""publicationName"":""""}]","[{""country"":""DE"",""submissionId"":20230000529,""endDate"":""2023-05-11T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Bundeswehr Institute of Radiobiology""}},""meetingId"":""fd3d323b12304f29b5c07337ad174f06"",""id"":""de2f322120484275ad76bba899a33a42""}],""name"":""25th Nuclear Medical Defense Conference / Global Conference on Radiation Topics (ConRad 2023)"",""location"":""Munich"",""id"":""fd3d323b12304f29b5c07337ad174f06"",""url"":""https://express.converia.de/frontend/index.php?folder_id=5982&page_id="",""startDate"":""2023-05-08T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C"",""900009""]",undefined,"[""Documentation and Information Science"",""Computer Systems""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230000529

We hypothesize that ex vivo DNA repair response to GCR components is a central determinant of cancer risk from space radiation and can serve as a biomarker of radiation risk in combination with genetics. Automated image quantification of 53BP1+ radiation-induced foci (RIF) during the first 4-48 h post-irradiation was performed as a function of dose and LET in non-immortalized primary skin fibroblasts derived from 76 mice across 15 strains (5 inbred reference strains and 10 collaborative-cross strains) exposed to X rays (0.1, 1 and 4 Gy), 350 MeV/n 40Ar and 600 MeV/n 56Fe (1.1 and 3 particles/100sq. μm), as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 768 healthy donors (matched ethnicity, 50/50 male/female, 18-70 years old) exposed to gamma rays (0.1 and 1 Gy), 350 MeV/n 28Si, 350 MeV/n 40Ar and 600 MeV/n 56Fe (1.1 and 3 particles/100sq. μm). A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on the mouse strains between DNA damage responses to space radiation and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We found SNPs, which were significantly associated to the RIF phenotype, mapped to genes and pathways that are functionally linked to health hazards for deep space exploration (e.g. carcinogenesis, nervous system damage and immune dysfunction). Some of these SNPs were located within protein coding regions, potentially interfering with protein functions and providing promising genetic targets for countermeasures. We also found correlations between both spontaneous and radiation-induced DNA damage and SNPs mapped to pathways associated with cellular metabolism. GWAS is undergoing for the human data. All data have been made available via the NASA Space Biology Open-Science database (genelab.nasa.gov) and we will discuss how various genomic and transcriptomic datasets can be accessed for modeling and integrated using machine learning methods for discovering new radiation biology.

Costes""]","We present a comparative analysis on the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage ex vivo in 15 strains of mice, including 5 inbred reference strains and 10 collaborative-cross strains, of both sexes. Non-immortalized primary skin fibroblasts derived from 76 mice were subjected to both low- and high-LET radiation (0.1, 1 and 4 Gy of X rays; 1.1 and 3 particles/100μm2 of 350 MeV/n 40Ar and 600 MeV/n 56Fe). Automated image quantification of 53BP1 radiation-induced foci (RIF) during the first 4-48 h post-irradiation was performed as a function of dose and LET. Similarly to what we had previously reported for immortalized human cell lines [1], we observed a saturation of RIF number with dose at 4h post-irradiation, with more RIF/Gy for lower LET (X rays and 40Ar) compared to 56Fe. However at later time points (24h and above), the trend was inverted with more RIF/Gy for higher LET. Our data suggest that multiple DSBs cluster into RIF: as the linear density of DSBs increases with LET, so does the probability of having more DSBs per RIF, which makes it more difficult for cells to fully resolve high-LET-induced RIF, explaining the hypersensitivity to high-LET radiation despite a low number of RIF. Taking into account the amount of clustering at a given dose and LET, but also the kinetics of DNA damage repair, we introduced a novel mathematical formalism to evaluate the number of remaining RIF over time.  We showed that the newly introduced kinetic metrics can be used as surrogate biomarkers for in vivo radiation toxicity, with potential applications in radiotherapy and human space exploration. In particular, we observed an association between the repairable fraction of RIF measured in vitro and survival levels of immune cells collected from irradiated mice. Moreover, the speed of DNA damage repair correlated with spontaneous cancer incidence data collected from the Mouse Tumor Biology database, suggesting a relationship between the efficiency of DSB repair after irradiation and cancer risk. In addition to the efficacy of repair and persistent RIF levels, even the amount of spontaneous foci without irradiation was shown to be strain dependent, indicating that these phenotypes are at least partially driven by genetics, and supporting their potential as indicators of individual radiation sensitivity.

However, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of how these might lead to detrimental health effects, particularly at low doses (100 mGy (milligray)). Recent advances in high throughput omics technologies enable interrogation of induced radiation effects at the genomic, proteomic and metabolomic levels. These include changes in gene expression, protein modifications, e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation, and metabolic changes. We will discuss the integration of data obtained from multiple omics platforms to understand radiation dose, and dose rate effects in a complex human tissue model as a function of time. We will use as an example our results on the low dose responses in a 3D human skin model.","[{""submissionId"":20190000208,""id"":""8e565b0f56cd4c0196e36fa1bf2308cb"",""publicationDate"":""2016-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190000208,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States"",""id"":""8ea3912a88dc41a98f1c11fb00b67426""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190000208,""endDate"":""2016-10-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""aed22a37a5c34edc89fe1457681304e5"",""id"":""ff8a6a0b8da54b9f8bf32d495d2acc7b""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR 2016)"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH"",""id"":""aed22a37a5c34edc89fe1457681304e5"",""startDate"":""2016-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190000208

The collection has its roots in the 1960s through collaborations by NASA Ames Research Center with other NASA centers, universities, and international space agencies by sharing non-human biospecimens from spaceflight and space-relevant ground experiments.  These collaborations have advanced the field of space exploration by helping to maximize the data gained from spaceflight and other NASA-funded experiments. NBISC coordinates closely with the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) which is responsible for organized sample collection from spaceflight and ground rodent experiments. In 2022 NBISC partnered with HRP’s Biospecimen and Tissue Sharing Collection (BTSC) Program to also archive samples from HRP’s Space Radiation Element-funded studies which primarily involve rodents exposed to various radiation protocols at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) and other analog facilities. To date, more than fifty thousand biospecimens from BTSC have been transferred to NBISC for distribution to the community. In 2023, NBISC embarked on a new Space Biology funded endeavor to create the Space Microbial Culture Collection (SMCC) which will serve as a central repository for microbial isolates associated with space flight, gravitational, and space radiation research.  This presentation will highlight several success stories of analyses carried out using archived NBISC samples received by researchers in recent years and will detail the process for proposing and receiving samples from NBISC, BTSC and SMCC.

20160001709,ABSTRACT,Oxidative Stress and Autophagy Responses of Osteocytes Exposed to Spaceflight-like Radiation.,"[""Tahimic, Candice "",""Rael, Victoria E."",""Globus, Ruth K. ""]","Weightlessness and radiation, two of the unique elements of the space environment, causes a profound decrement in bone mass that mimics aging. This bone loss is thought to result from increased activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and functional changes in bone-forming osteoblasts, cells that give rise to mature osteocytes. Our current understanding of the signaling factors and mechanisms underlying bone loss is incomplete. However, it is known that oxidative stress, characterized by the excess production of free radicals, is elevated during radiation exposure. The goals of this study is to examine the response of osteocytes to spaceflight-like radiation and to identify signaling processes that may be targeted to mitigate bone loss in scenarios of space exploration, earth-based radiotherapy and accidental radiation exposure. We hypothesize that (1) oxidative stress, as induced by radiation, decreases osteocyte survival and increases pro-osteoclastogenic signals and that (2) autophagy is one of the key cellular defenses against oxidative stress. Autophagy is the process by which cellular components including organelles and proteins are broken down and recycled. To test our hypothesis, we exposed the osteocyte-like cell line, MLO-Y4, to 0.5, 1, and 2 Gy of simulated space radiation (Iron-56 radiation at 600 MeV/n) and assessed cell numbers, cell growth-associated molecules as well as markers of autophagy and oxidative stress at various time points post-irradiation. We observed a reduction in cell numbers in the groups exposed to 1 and 2 Gy of Iron-56 radiation. Collectively, flow cytometry and gene expression analysis revealed that radiation caused a shift in cell cycle distribution consistent with growth arrest. Compared to sham-treatment, 2 Gy of Iron-56 increased FoxO3, SOD1, and RANKL gene expression yet unexpectedly decreased LC3B-II protein levels at 4 and 24 hours post-IR. Taken together, these findings suggest that simulated space radiation invoke antioxidant, pro-osteoclastogenic, and growth arrest responses in osteocytes. The implications of reduced autophagy flux at the time points examined remain to be elucidated.","[{""submissionId"":20160001709,""id"":""3c11a4679cc24e4a9b1467a2999d57be"",""publicationDate"":""2015-12-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160001709,""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States"",""id"":""56581d8c254045dc8354ccba4f983e34""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160001709,""endDate"":""2015-12-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""840b853d10b640e9aa225c81aa90a021"",""id"":""226a252a8acc4444b9bb52b02fb0d53f""}],""name"":""2015 Cell Biology ASCB Annual Meeting"",""location"":""San Diego, CA"",""id"":""840b853d10b640e9aa225c81aa90a021"",""startDate"":""2015-12-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""MA02501"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160001709
20230016140,POSTER,Graphical User Interface (GUI) Implementation for Agent-Based Microbial Radiobiology Model,"[""Madeline V. Marous"",""Daniel Palacios"",""Jessica A. Lee""]","Sending human life past the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to explore the Moon and Mars will be challenging. The Earth’s magnetic field naturally protects life from deep-space particle radiation such as Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and Solar Particle Events (SPE); these will pose health risks to humans in deep space. Research has been done to investigate these effects, like BioSentinel, the first biological CubeSat to fly beyond the LEO, designed to culture yeast in a microfluidic device and record optical measurements of growth and metabolism. However, experiments can only report cell damage as bulk growth curves, while deep-space radiation causes damage that is heterogeneous among individual cells. AMMPER is an open-source, agent-based, computational model coded in Python to simulate the effects of deep-space radiation on individual yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to facilitate interpretation of biological radiation experiments. Version 1.0 of the code ran in a command line interface (CLI), limiting use to those familiar with modularization, object-oriented programming, and computational models. Here we present a graphical user interface (GUI) for AMMPER to increase its accessibility. GUI development included converting input points and UI files, designing an application and logo, and expanding program packages. Additionally, we added optical assistance that corresponded with simulation parameters, which included simulation type, cell type, ROS model, and radiation dosage, as well as customizable display and file exportation features. Following a pilot testing period, its structure was updated further to enhance abilities, adding increased runs, video visualization, data plotting, and an educational/tutorial component. Future work will include creating a bit installer and runtime environment for AMMPER. Ultimately, the creation of the GUI has two main goals: to facilitate the integration of computational models into the work of researchers in microbial radiobiology, and to act as an interactive and visual resource for space biology education.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230016140,""endDate"":""2023-11-18T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f9e3bc17fc0745bca78888ba2270315b"",""id"":""5e619fb9166e47739f9d985b32cfad8c""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""f9e3bc17fc0745bca78888ba2270315b"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2023-meeting/"",""startDate"":""2023-11-14T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.04.01.02.01.02.02""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230016140

Unlike on the International Space Station (ISS), where crew support and sample return are possible, experiments for long-duration missions require autonomous systems with no sample return.

Human cells would be ideal biosensors, but limitations in culture methods, extended prelaunch storage, and long flight durations make it difficult to keep human cells alive. Unlike other model systems, yeast can survive the constraints of long-duration spaceflight. Despite a billion years of evolution separating yeast from humans, we share homology in hundreds of genes important for basic cell function, including responses to DNA damage. Thus, yeast are excellent biosensors for detecting types/extent of damage induced by space radiation.

BioSentinel is NASA’s latest biological CubeSat, and first interplanetary space bioscience mission. BioSentinel is launching on Artemis 1, the first flight of NASA’s Space Launch System, in 2022. The BioSensor payload within BioSentinel contains two yeast strains. The wild type serves as a control for health and normal DNA damage repair (DDR). The rad51 deletion mutant is defective for DDR and will undergo alterations to growth and metabolism as it accumulates radiation damage. Changes in growth and metabolic activity will be measured using a 3-color LED detection system and the metabolic redox dye alamarBlue®.

Preliminary tests indicate a significant change in alamarBlue responses to space-like, low-dose ionizing radiation. We will discuss these findings in five parts – Introduction to NASA’s biological CubeSats and BioSentinel (presented by Sergio Santa Maria), analysis of flight data from the ISS mission (presented by Kylie Akiyama), preliminary molecular responses to space radiation (presented here), a deeper dive into those pathways (presented by Kyra Keenan), and characterizing stress response through redox potential data (presented by Diana Gentry).",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220009591,""endDate"":""2022-11-12T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""40e292dade5754e3979554f9c3646d0e"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Leidos (United States)"",""location"":""Reston, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""e64969819f6f4105a76083849ebecb3e"",""id"":""d5f91002f33546f2bc97ca1bfe7bed56""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research Annual Conference"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""e64969819f6f4105a76083849ebecb3e"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2022-meeting/"",""startDate"":""2022-11-09T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""SRS BioSentinel 10448.9C.ID036SRS.01.810""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220009591

In order to maximize the intelligibility of these data, particularly for users with limited bioinformatics knowledge, GeneLab is now transforming the data in the repository into actual biological and physiological knowledge of the genetic and proteomic signatures found in these samples. This processed data is being derived by establishing standard data analysis workflows vetted by 114 scientists who are members of the four GeneLab Analysis Working Groups (Animal AWG, Plant AWG, Microbe AWG, Multi-Omics AWG). AWG members from institutes spanning the U.S. and four other countries participate on a voluntary basis. The AWGs meet monthly to discuss data mining, compare results and interpretations, and test forthcoming releases of the GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS). GLDS version 3.0 has been available to the general public since October 1st 2018, and has been providing a professional state-of-the-art bioinformatics platform for everyone in the space biology community to upload their data into a space biology omics data commons, to process their data with vetted standard workflows and to compare to existing analyses. The user interface for the platform is being designed to be accessible to a broad variety of users including those with limited bioinformatics experience, including high school and college students who can use it to learn about omics data analysis and space biology. As such, Genelab will constitute a powerful general public outreach capability of NASA and the Space Biology community at large. Data mining of the GeneLab database by the AWG has already started generating very interesting findings, including reports linking specific spaceflight conditions such as radiation, microgravity or carbon dioxide levels to molecular changes seen across various species. In this presentation, we will report on the current and future objectives for GeneLab, and review recent studies reported by the various AWGs relating molecular changes observed in various animal models and tissue with microgravity, radiation, circadian rhythm, hydration and carbon dioxide conditions.","[{""submissionId"":20190027260,""id"":""f728621ebe164495a2b6338233008942"",""publicationDate"":""2019-02-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190027260,""name"":""American Association for the Advancement of Science"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States"",""id"":""5641539273bc4ca481d14a72f878c766""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190027260,""endDate"":""2019-02-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Association for the Advancement of Science"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d95fc414931e43988f0550d64f4519ab"",""id"":""2220e7efe2af4e7dbaf19a560e4d845c""}],""name"":""American Association for the Advancement of Science Annual Meeting (AAAS 2019)"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""d95fc414931e43988f0550d64f4519ab"",""startDate"":""2019-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190027260

20205010349,PRESENTATION,Developing Technologies for Biological Experiments in Deep Space,"[""Sergio R. Santa Maria""]","NASA Ames Research Center is the leader in developing autonomous nanosatellites or CubeSats to address strategic knowledge gaps about the effects of space travel on biological organisms, including GeneSat, PharmaSat, and EcAMSat. Now that NASA has set its sights on human exploration in deep space, such missions require significant technological and biomedical countermeasures to protect astronauts from chronic radiation exposure. CubeSats can inform these countermeasures by querying relevant space environments with model organisms and/or biosensors.
BioSentinel will be the first interplanetary CubeSat to study the biological response to space radiation outside low Earth orbit in almost 50 years. BioSentinel is an autonomous platform able to support biology and to investigate the effects of space radiation on a model organism in interplanetary deep space. It will fly onboard Artemis-1, from which it will be deployed on a lunar fly-by trajectory and into a heliocentric orbit.
BioSentinel, a 6U CubeSat (1U = 10-cm cube), will measure the DNA damage response to ambient space radiation in a model organism, which will be compared to information provided by an onboard radiation spectrometer and to data obtained on the ISS and on Earth. Even though the primary objective of the mission is to develop an autonomous spacecraft capable of conducting biological experiments in deep space, the 4U BioSensor science payload contained within the free-flyer is an adaptable instrument that can perform bio measurements with different microorganisms and in multiple space environments, including the ISS, lunar gateway, and on the surface of the Moon. Thus, nanosatellites like BioSentinel can be used to study the effects of both reduced gravity and space radiation and can house different organisms to answer specific science questions. In addition to their flexibility, nanosatellites also provide a low-cost alternative to more complex and larger missions, and require minimal crew support, if any.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20205010349,""endDate"":""2020-11-20T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""34fe646fa6d759da8377792b5138c3f4"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency"",""location"":""Tokyo, Japan""}},""meetingId"":""ab53925a564c430dbea40b0a5274f1d7"",""id"":""ac868823d96c46e985c7f1ee0b5f487a""},{""organizationId"":""8ab436ac7a395933b547d9832e888653"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Canadian Space Agency"",""location"":""Longueuil, Quebec, Canada""}},""meetingId"":""ab53925a564c430dbea40b0a5274f1d7"",""id"":""86ace3dffbb548ba93af98f5a9ded88c""},{""organizationId"":""d843f4f3dd0352f2808ffc1b2eadd095"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""European Space Agency"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""ab53925a564c430dbea40b0a5274f1d7"",""id"":""ac376d8040b4416180c99868687c9163""},{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ab53925a564c430dbea40b0a5274f1d7"",""id"":""1f6640068e8846dba90398e032f88836""}],""name"":""ISS Increment 64 Science Symposium"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""ab53925a564c430dbea40b0a5274f1d7"",""startDate"":""2020-11-17T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20205007942,""title"":""Developing Technologies for Biological Experiments in Deep Space ""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205010349

Indeed, this cornerstone perspective on FAIR and maximally open access data was also recommended in the recent 2023-2032 Decadal Survey from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 

The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) is a maximally open access and FAIR database, and meets various scientific, technical, and operational spaceflight needs. It offers public users and submitters the ability to upload, download, search, share, analyze, and visualize data across ‘omics, physiological, phenotypic, behavioral, bioimaging, video, and environmental monitoring telemetry datasets. OSDR includes NASA GeneLab, NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive, and the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection. OSDR has >455 studies with datasets from model organisms and non-NASA human astronauts. There are ~12 datasets from the Inspiration 4 (I4) mission, spanning metagenomics, comprehensive metabolic panels, clonal hematopoiesis, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and cytokine panels. In the interest of data privacy, two I4 datasets have raw FASTQ and FASTA files relating to the epitranscriptome, and a new request feature is live in OSDR (with a backend review process established) which was developed based on industry norms. OSDR also recently began a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) to scientifically curate and make available >200 terabytes of human and model organism space-relevant data. The OSDR submission portal is designed to ingest and curate ~25 ‘omics assay data types, and ~50 physiological-phenotypic-imaging assay data types, spanning ultrasonography, micro-computed tomography, histology, morphometric photography, rebound tonometry, gait analysis, optical coherence tomography, novel object recognition, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. 

A suite of analysis tools are available for OSDR users including: 1) an Environmental Data Application to compare radiation, CO2, relative humidity, temperature, and other telemetry across missions and subjects, 2) the RadLab database, a collaboration between NASA, ESA, the German and Italian Space Agencies, and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, which compiles radiation measurements relevant to human spaceflight and provides tools for accessing and manipulating the data, and 3) a Multi-study visualization tool which enables users to look across and combine GeneLab’s omics datasets across different experiments and missions.

There are ~600 volunteer OSDR Analysis Working Group (AWG) members who: 1) provide feedback on scientific standards for reuse (subject and assay metadata; processing pipelines; dataset formats and uniformed structures for machine-readability), and 2) collaborate to mine-reuse OSDR data conducting scientific analysis. OSDR has enabled 60 publications as of September 2023, many directly from AWG collaborations most notably the Cell Press package in 2020. Lastly, there are at least 15 articles which mine OSDR data part of a package of ~50 articles across Nature Portfolio with research stemming from I4, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, NASA Space Biology, and the NASA Human Research Program.

G.""]","Future manned missions beyond low earth orbit require accurate predictions of the risk to astronauts and to critical systems from exposure to ionizing radiation. For low-level exposures, the hazards are dominated by rare single-event phenomena where individual cosmic-ray particles or spallation reactions result in potentially catastrophic changes in critical components. Examples might be a biological lesion leading to cancer in an astronaut or a memory upset leading to an undesired rocket firing. The risks of such events appears to depend on the amount of energy deposited within critical sensitive volumes of biological cells and microelectronic components. The critical environmental information needed to estimate the risks posed by the natural space environments, including solar flares, is the number of times more than a threshold amount of energy for an event will be deposited in the critical microvolumes. These predictions are complicated by uncertainties in the natural environments, particularly the composition of flares, and by the effects of shielding. Microdosimetric data for large numbers of orbits are needed to improve the environmental models and to test the transport codes used to predict event rates.","[{""volume"":""14"",""submissionId"":19940039131,""issue"":""10"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""74a74c56415b4875af04a6ead452d2a9"",""publicationName"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1"",""publicationDate"":""1994-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""},{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940039131

The health risk from exposure to these ions and their secondary radiations generated in shield materials is poorly understood since there are few human data and a systematic study in relevant animal model systems has not been made. The accuracy of risk prediction is described as the major limiting factor in the management of space radiation risk. The expected impact of systematic studies is examined using the limited available biological data and models. Given the limitations of current predictions, models must be developed that are able to incorporate the required fundamental scientific data into accurate risk estimates. The important radiation components that can be provided for laboratory testing are identified. The use of ground-based accelerator beams to simulate space radiation is explained and quantitative scientific constraints on such facilities are derived. Three facilities, one each in the United States, in Germany and in Japan, currently have the partial capability to satisfy these constraints.

In the interest of data privacy, two I4 datasets have raw FASTQ and FASTA files relating to the epitranscriptome, and a new request feature is live in OSDR (with a backend review process established) which was developed based on industry norms. OSDR also recently began a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) to scientifically curate and make available >200 terabytes of human and model organism space-relevant data. The OSDR submission portal is designed to ingest and curate ~25 ‘omics assay data types, and ~50 physiological-phenotypic-imaging assay data types, spanning ultrasonography, micro-computed tomography, histology, morphometric photography, rebound tonometry, gait analysis, optical coherence tomography, novel object recognition, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. 

A suite of analysis tools are available for OSDR users including: 1) an Environmental Data Application to compare radiation, CO2, relative humidity, temperature, and other telemetry across missions and subjects, 2) the RadLab database, a collaboration between NASA, ESA, the German and Italian Space Agencies, and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, which compiles radiation measurements relevant to human spaceflight and provides tools for accessing and manipulating the data, and 3) a Multi-study visualization tool which enables users to look across and combine GeneLab’s omics datasets across different experiments and missions.

There are ~600 volunteer OSDR Analysis Working Group (AWG) members who: 1) provide feedback on scientific standards for reuse (subject and assay metadata; processing pipelines; dataset formats and uniformed structures for machine-readability), and 2) collaborate to mine-reuse OSDR data conducting scientific analysis. OSDR has enabled 60 publications as of September 2023, many directly from AWG collaborations most notably the Cell Press package in 2020. Lastly, there are at least 15 articles which mine OSDR data part of a package of ~50 articles across Nature Portfolio with research stemming from I4, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, NASA Space Biology, and the NASA Human Research Program.

A.""]","To obtain information on the cytogenetic damage caused by space radiation, chromosome exchanges in lymphocytes from crewmembers of long-term Mir missions, and a shorter duration shuttle mission, were examined using fluorescence in situ hybridization. A significant increase in chromosomal aberrations was observed after the long duration flights. The ratio of aberrations identified as complex was higher post-flight for some crewmembers, which is thought to be an indication of exposure to high-LET radiation. Ground-based studies have shown that the frequency of aberrations measured post-flight could be influenced by a mitotic delay in cells damaged by high-LET radiation and this effect could lower biological dose estimates. To counteract this effect, prematurely condensed chromosome (PCC) spreads were collected. Frequencies of aberrations in PCC were compared with those in metaphase spreads.","[{""volume"":""17 Suppl 1"",""submissionId"":20040088537,""issn"":""1120-1797"",""id"":""406a386a893348c08fbc855028d96a5a"",""publicationName"":""Physica medica :  PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088537

Conflicting events of spaceflight include waiting to get manifested, delays in manifest schedules, training astronauts to not shake your cultures and to add reagents slowly, as shaking or quick injection can activate signaling cascades and give you erroneous results. It is important to select good hardware that is reliable. Possible conflicting environments in flight include g-force and vibration of launch, exposure of cells to microgravity for extended periods until hardware is turned on, changes in cabin gases and cosmic radiation. One should have an on-board 1-g control centrifuge in order to eliminate environmental differences. Other obstacles include getting your funding in a timely manner (it is not uncommon for two to three years to pass between notification of grant approval for funding and actually getting funded). That said, it is important to note that microgravity research is worthwhile since all terrestrial life evolved in a gravity field and secrets of biological function may only be answered by removing the constant of gravity.

We will use the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a biosensor to determine how deep-space radiation affects living organisms and to potentially quantify radiation levels through radiation damage analysis. Radiation can damage DNA through double strand breaks (DSBs), which can normally be repaired by homologous recombination. Two yeast strains will be air-dried and stored in microfluidic cards within the payload: a wild-type control strain and a radiation sensitive rad51 mutant that is deficient in DSB repairs. Throughout the mission, the microfluidic cards will be rehydrated with growth medium and an indicator dye. Growth rates of each strain will be measured through LED detection of the reduction of the indicator dye, which correlates with DNA repair and the amount of radiation damage accumulated. Results from BioSentinel will be compared to analog experiments on the ISS and on Earth. It is well known that desiccation can damage yeast cells and decrease viability over time. We performed a screen for desiccation-tolerant rad51 strains. We selected 20 re-isolates of rad51 and ran a weekly screen for desiccation-tolerant mutants for five weeks. Our data shows that viability decreases over time, confirming previous research findings. Isolates L2, L5 and L14 indicate desiccation tolerance and are candidates for whole-genome sequencing. More time is needed to determine whether a specific strain is truly desiccation tolerant. Furthermore, we conducted an intracellular trehalose assay to test how intracellular trehalose concentrations affect or protect the mutant strains against desiccation stress. S. cerevisiae cell and reagent concentrations from a previously established intracellular trehalose protocol did not yield significant absorbance measurements, so we tested varying cell and reagent concentrations and determined proper concentrations for successful protocol use.","[{""submissionId"":20180003379,""id"":""bbaeed2722b74990a6995927817fbbf1"",""publicationDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20180003379,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""location"":""Arlington, VA, United States"",""id"":""ef2c36f56d6340d2b07c6311602fc184""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180003379,""endDate"":""2017-10-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""location"":""Arlington, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""39b866ec8c324e0386e7a1fea8109a97"",""id"":""ad8ecfcdd3c44248acab07c2010edfb3""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Seattle, WA"",""id"":""39b866ec8c324e0386e7a1fea8109a97"",""startDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20170011556,""title"":""Biosentinel: Improving Desiccation Tolerance of Yeast Biosensors for Deep-Space Missions""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180003379
20205007942,PRESENTATION,Developing Technologies for Biological Experiments in Deep Space ,"[""Sergio R Santa Maria""]","NASA Ames Research Center is the leader in developing autonomous nanosatellites or CubeSats to address strategic knowledge gaps about the effects of space travel on biological organisms, including GeneSat, PharmaSat, and EcAMSat. Now that NASA has set its sights on human exploration in deep space, such missions require significant technological and biomedical countermeasures to protect astronauts from chronic radiation exposure. CubeSats can inform these countermeasures by querying relevant space environments with model organisms and/or biosensors.
BioSentinel will be the first interplanetary CubeSat to study the biological response to space radiation outside low Earth orbit in almost 50 years. BioSentinel is an autonomous platform able to support biology and to investigate the effects of space radiation on a model organism in interplanetary deep space. It will fly onboard Artemis-1, from which it will be deployed on a lunar fly-by trajectory and into a heliocentric orbit.
BioSentinel, a 6U CubeSat (1U = 10-cm cube), will measure the DNA damage response to ambient space radiation in a model organism, which will be compared to information provided by an onboard radiation spectrometer and to data obtained on the ISS and on Earth. Even though the primary objective of the mission is to develop an autonomous spacecraft capable of conducting biological experiments in deep space, the 4U BioSensor science payload contained within the free-flyer is an adaptable instrument that can perform bio measurements with different microorganisms and in multiple space environments, including the ISS, lunar gateway, and on the surface of the Moon. Thus, nanosatellites like BioSentinel can be used to study the effects of both reduced gravity and space radiation and can house different organisms to answer specific science questions. In addition to their flexibility, nanosatellites also provide a low-cost alternative to more complex and larger missions, and require minimal crew support, if any

Today, the World Wide Web is sophisticated enough to support the entire HZETRN code and all of the associated pre and post processing tools. This package is called SIREST (Space Ionizing Radiation Effects and Shielding Tools). There are many advantages to SIREST. The most important advantage is the instant update capability of the web. Another major advantage is the modularity that the web imposes on the code. Right now, the major disadvantage of SIREST will be its modularity inside the designer's system. This mostly comes from the fact that a consistent interface between the designer and the computer system to evaluate the design is incomplete.

20020050921,ABSTRACT,Radiation Effect on Human Tissue,"[""Richmond, Robert C."",""Cruz, Angela"",""Bors, Karen"",""Curreri, Peter A.""]","Predicting the occurrence of human cancer following exposure of an epidemiologic population to any agent causing genetic damage is a difficult task. To an approximation, this is because the uncertainty of uniform exposure to the damaging agent, and the uncertainty of uniform processing of that damage within a complex set of biological variables, degrade the confidence of predicting the delayed expression of cancer as a relatively rare event within clinically normal individuals. This situation begs the need for alternate controlled experimental models that are predictive for the development of human cancer following exposures to agents causing genetic damage. Such models historically have not been of substantial proven value. It is more recently encouraging, however, that developments in molecular and cell biology have led to an expanded knowledge of human carcinogenesis, and of molecular markers associated with that process. It is therefore appropriate to consider new laboratory models developed to accomodate that expanded knowledge in order to assess the cancer risks associated with exposures to genotoxic agents. When ionizing radiation of space is the genotoxic agent, then a series of additional considerations for human cancer risk assessment must also be applied. These include the dose of radiation absorbed by tissue at different locations in the body, the quality of the absorbed radiation, the rate at which absorbed dose accumulates in tissue, the way in which absorbed dose is measured and calculated, and the alterations in incident radiation caused by shielding materials. It is clear that human cancer risk assessment for damage caused by ionizing radiation is a multidisciplinary responsibility, and that within this responsibility no single discipline can hold disproportionate sway if a risk assessment model of radiation-induced human cancer is to be developed that has proven value. Biomolecular and cellular markers from the work reported here are considered for use in assessing human cancer risk related to exposure to space radiation. This potential use must be integrated within the specified multidisciplinary context in order to create a new tool of molecular epidemiology that can hopefully then realistically assess this cancer risk.","[{""submissionId"":20020050921,""id"":""2250b897a74f4783a85ef042e3a51de3"",""publicationDate"":""2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20020050921,""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""0df8551644724aba8cd1b775ed39a043""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20020050921,""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""541730f155084319a581c897b3ad20ef"",""id"":""fb3144a4160b402ea20713da4467174a""}],""name"":""40th American Institute of Aeronautics and Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit"",""location"":""Reno, NV"",""id"":""541730f155084319a581c897b3ad20ef"",""startDate"":""2002-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020050921

When completed, GeneLab will provide the integrated software and hardware infrastructure, analytical tools and reference datasets for an assortment of model organisms. GeneLab will also provide an environment for scientists to collaborate thereby increasing the possibility for data to be reused for future experimentation. To maximize the value of data from life science experiments performed in space and to make the most advantageous use of the remaining ISS research window, GeneLab will apply an open access approach to conducting spaceflight experiments by generating, and sharing the datasets derived from these biological studies in space.Onboard the ISS, a wide variety of model organisms will be studied and returned to Earth for analysis. Laboratories on the ground will analyze these samples and provide genomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic data. Upon receipt, NASA will conduct data quality control tasks and format raw data returned from the omics centers into standardized, annotated information sets that can be readily searched and linked to spaceflight metadata. Once prepared, the biological datasets, as well as any analysis completed, will be made public through the GeneLab Space Bioinformatics System webb as edportal. These efforts will support a collaborative research environment for spaceflight studies that will closely resemble environments created by the Department of Energy (DOE), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and other institutions in additional areas of study, such as cancer and environmental biology. The results will allow for comparative analyses that will help scientists around the world take a major leap forward in understanding the effect of microgravity, radiation, and other aspects of the space environment on model organisms.

One possible solution to help reduce this risk is the addition of in situ produced supplemental fresh produce to supplement and enhance the astronaut diet.  A number of ground and ISS-based studies are being conducted which are helping to reduce this risk by filling the gaps in knowledge and technology associated with space crop production.   These include studies with the Veggie vegetable production system on the International Space Station.  Key focus areas include water and nutrient delivery, food safety and the crop microbiome, crop selection and testing, automation and robotics, radiation impacts, seed storage and handling, and scalability for different concepts and architectures.  All of these areas have significant challenges that need to be addressed prior to successful integration of crop production into the crew diet.

20060013112,ABSTRACT,The Space Physics of Life: Searching for Biosignatures on Habitable Icy Worlds Affected by Space Weathering,"[""Cooper, John F.""]","Accessible surfaces of the most likely astrobiological habitats (Mars, Europa, Titan) in the solar system beyond Earth are exposed to various chemical and hydrologic weathering processes directly or indirectly induced by interaction with the overlying space environment. These processes can be both beneficial, through provision of chemical compounds and energy, and destructive, through chemical dissociation or burial, to detectable presence of biosignatures. Orbital, suborbital, and surface platforms carrying astrobiological instrumentation must survive, and preferably exploit, space environment interactions to reach these habitats and search for evidence of life or its precursors. Experience from Mars suggests that any detection of biosignatures must be accompanied by characterization of the local chemical environment and energy sources including irradiation by solar ultraviolet photons and energetic particles from the space environment. Orbital and suborbital surveys of surface chemistry and astrobiological potential in the context of the space environment should precede targeted in-situ measurements to maximize probability of biosignature detection through site selection. The Space Physics of Life (SPOL) investigation has recently been proposed to the NASA Astrobiology Institute and is briefly described in this presentation. SPOL is the astrobiologically relevant study of the interactions and relationships of potentially? or previously inhabited, bodies of the solar system with the surrounding environments. This requires an interdisciplinary effort in space physics, planetary science, and radiation biology. The proposed investigation addresses the search for habitable environments, chemical resources to support life, and techniques for detection of organic and inorganic signs of life in the context of the space environment.","[{""submissionId"":20060013112,""id"":""b52d525fe6c24bf8997ec14fe13d3985"",""publicationDate"":""2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20060013112,""endDate"":""2006-03-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Astrobiology Science Conference 2006"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""90af66f86842494f9fc8a47bae9f9574"",""startDate"":""2006-03-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20060013112
20205004710,POSTER,Considering Cell Proliferation to Optimize Detection of Radiation-induced 53BP1+ Foci in 15 Mouse Strains ex vivo,"[""Eloise Pariset"",""Sebastien Penninckx"",""Ana Uriarte Acuna"",""Stephane Lucas"",""Sylvain V Costes""]","Due to high metabolic activity, proliferating cells continuously generate free radicals, which induce DNA double strand breaks (DSB).   Fluorescently tagged nuclear foci of DNA repair protein 53 binding protein-1(53BP1) are used as a standard metric for measuring  DSB formation at baseline and in response to environmental insults such as radiation. Here we demonstrate that the background    level of spontaneous 53BP1+ foci formation can be modeled mathematically as a function of cell confluence, which is a metric of  proliferation rate. This model was validated using spontaneous 53BP1+ foci data from 68 cultures of primary skin fibroblasts derived  from 15 different strains of mice, showing a ~10 fold decrease from low to full confluence that is independent of mouse strain. We developed an online open access tool to correct for the impact of cell confluence on the detection of radiation-induced 53BP1+ foci (RIF).

So far, astronauts rely heavily on prepackaged, heat stabilized foods with no ability to “cook” or refrigerate foods or their ingredients.  Fresh produce and other perishable food items are only available for a short period after the arrival of cargo vessel.  The current ISS food system is designed to supply foods for less than three years, while Mars missions will require foods having at least a five-year shelf life.  Plant growth systems can produce fresh, nutrient rich foods and offer other benefits.  Currently plant and other systems are being explored as ways to provide fresh food, vitamins and other essential nutrients to crews, particularly ones with shorter shelf lives or that reduce radiation damage. This presentation will focus on the benefits and challenges of fresh food systems for deep space, as well as learnings and alternative approaches being explored by NASA and coming from the NASA’s Deep Space Food Challenge.

20040087539,REPRINT,Fundamental space radiobiology,"[""Nelson, Gregory A.""]","The unique feature of the space radiation environment is the dominance of high-energy charged particles (HZE or high LET radiation) emitted by the Sun and galactic sources, or trapped in the Van Allen radiation belts. These charged particles present a significant hazard to space flight crews, and accelerator-based experiments are underway to quantify the health risks due to unavoidable radiation exposure. There are three principal properties of charged particles that distinguish them from conventional radiation, i.e. gamma rays and x-rays. First, they have a defined range in matter rather than an exponential absorption profile. Second, they undergo nuclear reactions to produce secondary particles. Third, and most important, they deposit their energy along well-defined linear paths or tracks rather than diffuse fields. The structured energy deposition pattern interacts on multiple scales with the biological structures of DNA, cells and tissues to produce correlated patterns of damage that evade repair systems. Traditional concepts of dose and its associated normalization parameter, RBE (relative biological effectiveness), break down under experimental scrutiny, and probabilistic models of risk based on the number of particle traversals per cell may be more appropriate. Unique patterns of DNA damage, gene expression, mobilization of repair proteins, activation of cytokines and remodeling of cellular microenvironment are observed following exposure to high LET radiation. At low levels of exposure the communication of bioactive substances from irradiated to unirradiated ""bystander"" cells can amplify the damage and cause a significant deviation from linearity in dose vs. response relations. Under some circumstances, there is even a multigenerational delay in the expression of radiation-induced genetic damage (genomic instability) which is not strictly dose dependent. These issues and the experimental evidence derived from ground based experiments at particle accelerators are presented along with speculation about how modified inertial conditions might perturb homeostatic responses to radiation to further complicate risk assessment for space flight.","[{""volume"":""16"",""submissionId"":20040087539,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""1089-988X"",""id"":""4cb144bd0fdb49dd8cc15feaee36b6ce"",""publicationName"":""Gravitational and space biology bulletin :  publication of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""publicationDate"":""2003-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NCC9-149""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040087539

NASA's programs conducting life sciences studies - the Human Research Program, Space Biology, Astrobiology, and Planetary Protection - see the Deep Space Gateway (DSG) as affording enormous opportunities to investigate biological organisms in a unique environment that cannot be replicated in Earth-based laboratories or on Low Earth Orbit science platforms. These investigations may provide in many cases the definitive answers to risks associated with exploration and living outside Earth's protective magnetic field. Unlike Low Earth Orbit or terrestrial locations, the Gateway location will be subjected to the true deep space spectrum and influence of both galactic cosmic and solar particle radiation and thus presents an opportunity to investigate their long-term exposure effects. The question of how a community of biological organisms change over time within the harsh environment of space flight outside of the magnetic field protection can be investigated. The biological response to the absence of Earth's geomagnetic field can be studied for the first time. Will organisms change in new and unique ways under these new conditions? This may be specifically true on investigations of microbial communities. The Gateway provides a platform for microbiology experiments both inside, to improve understanding of interactions between microbes and human habitats, and outside, to improve understanding of microbe-hardware interactions exposed to the space environment.","[{""submissionId"":20180001581,""id"":""11f72146a041441e999a69f092045d0e"",""publicationDate"":""2018-02-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180001581,""endDate"":""2018-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""dc64d10ab98d42ac855dd81600d5373a"",""id"":""9f81e3857ffb4a369be817004d3d9cd3""}],""name"":""Deep Space Gateway Science Workshop"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""dc64d10ab98d42ac855dd81600d5373a"",""startDate"":""2018-02-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180001581

For radiation risk assessment, an understanding of carcinogenic effect of heavy ions in human cells is most essential. In our laboratory, we have successfully developed a human mammary epithelial cell system for studying the neoplastic transformation in vitro. Growth variants were obtained from heavy ion irradiated immortal mammary cell line. These cloned growth variants can grow in regular tissue culture media and maintain anchorage dependent growth and density inhibition property. Upon further irradiation with high-Linear Energy Transfer (LET) radiation, transformed foci were found. Experimental results from these studies suggest that multiexposure of radiation is required to induce neoplastic tranformation of human epithelial cells. This multihits requirement may be due to high genomic stability of human cells. These growth variants can be useful model systems for space flight experiments to determine the carcinogenic effect of space radiation in human epithelial cells.","[{""volume"":""14"",""submissionId"":19940039035,""issue"":""10"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""59c278f8e92041acaf6b7c2dc4dcd8bb"",""publicationName"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1"",""publicationDate"":""1994-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""T9297R""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""},{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940039035
20040089378,REPRINT,Plants and somatic embryos in space: what have we learned?,"[""Krikorian, A. D.""]","Space provides a unique environment that can affect the interplay between cell cycle controls and environment and can thus modify the processes of cell division, development and growth. It is proposed that the chromosomal and nuclear abnormalities frequently encountered in cells of various plants exposed to space are due to a combination of factors including the biological status of the systems and the way in which they are grown, exposed to, and ultimately, the way in which they experience multiple stresses. The extent to which space-specific changes become manifest is dependent on the extent of pre-existing stresses in the system. This has become evident in a variety of plant species grown in space but has been particularly amenable to study using in vitro systems, especially in developing embryoids. The following observations allow us to harmonize disparate results from a variety of space experiments:- (a) the more completely developed a system, the less likely it is to show cell stress during growth; the less morphologically complex, the greater the vulnerability; (b) the size/""packaging"" of the genome (karyotype) are significant experimental variables; plants with larger genomes (e.g. polyploids) seem to be more space-stress tolerant; (c) a single space-associated stress is inadequate to produce a significant adverse response unless the stress is severe, or a biological parameter necessary to 'amplify' it exists. On this view, an appropriate ""stress match"" with other non-equilibrium determinants, much like a 'tug of war', can result in genomic variations in space. All this emphasizes that fastidiously-controlled growing environments must be devised if one is to resolve the matter of direct versus indirect effects of space. Better understanding of the novel physico-chemical equilibrium phenomena associated with space will allow those interested in space cell and developmental biology to pick and choose procedures best suited to their exploitation for specific objectives.","[{""volume"":""11"",""submissionId"":20040089378,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""1089-988X"",""id"":""423384cf5abc451fa865f2e8fb9b7e69"",""publicationName"":""Gravitational and space biology bulletin :  publication of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""publicationDate"":""1998-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089378

In place of an optical detection system, BioLEAD will employ a miniaturized, non-invasive dielectric spectroscopy sensor to enable real-time monitoring of biological activity. The sensor operates by relating capacitance measurements to the dielectric properties of the cell, such as cell morphology, doubling time, and cell cycle stage. The implementation of this new sensor technology will address limitations of the optical measurement system used on BioSentinel.

And while the ISS partners can be proud of having completed one of the most ambitious engineering projects ever conceived, the challenge of successfully using the platform remains. During the ISS assembly phase, the potential benefits of space-based research and development were demonstrated; including the advancement of scientific knowledge based on experiments conducted in space, development and testing of new technologies, and derivation of Earth applications from new understanding. The configurability and human-tended capabilities of the ISS provide a unique platform. The international utilization strategy is based on research ranging from physical sciences, biology, medicine, psychology, to Earth observation, human exploration preparation and technology demonstration. The ability to complete follow-on investigations in a period of months allows researchers to make rapid advances based on new knowledge gained from ISS activities. During the utilization phase, the ISS partners are working together to track the objectives, accomplishments, and the applications of the new knowledge gained. This presentation will summarize the consolidated international results of these tracking activities and approaches. Areas of current research on ISS with strong international cooperation will be highlighted including cardiovascular studies, cell and plant biology studies, radiation, physics of matter, and advanced alloys.

20140012041,ABSTRACT,Automated Miniaturized Instrument for Space Biology Applications and the Monitoring of the Astronauts Health Onboard the ISS,"[""Karouia, Fathi"",""Peyvan, Kia"",""Danley, David"",""Ricco, Antonio J."",""Santos, Orlando"",""Pohorille, Andrew""]","Human space travelers experience a unique environment that affects homeostasis and physiologic adaptation. The spacecraft environment subjects the traveler to noise, chemical and microbiological contaminants, increased radiation, and variable gravity forces. As humans prepare for long-duration missions to the International Space Station (ISS) and beyond, effective measures must be developed, verified and implemented to ensure mission success. Limited biomedical quantitative capabilities are currently available onboard the ISS. Therefore, the development of versatile instruments to perform space biological analysis and to monitor astronauts' health is needed. We are developing a fully automated, miniaturized system for measuring gene expression on small spacecraft in order to better understand the influence of the space environment on biological systems. This low-cost, low-power, multi-purpose instrument represents a major scientific and technological advancement by providing data on cellular metabolism and regulation. The current system will support growth of microorganisms, extract and purify the RNA, hybridize it to the array, read the expression levels of a large number of genes by microarray analysis, and transmit the measurements to Earth. The system will help discover how bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics and how pathogenic bacteria sometimes increase their virulence in space, facilitating the development of adequate countermeasures to decrease risks associated with human spaceflight. The current stand-alone technology could be used as an integrated platform onboard the ISS to perform similar genetic analyses on any biological systems from the tree of life. Additionally, with some modification the system could be implemented to perform real-time in-situ microbial monitoring of the ISS environment (air, surface and water samples) and the astronaut's microbiome using 16SrRNA microarray technology. Furthermore, the current system can be enhanced substantially by combining it with other technologies for automated, miniaturized, high-throughput biological measurements, such as fast sequencing, protein identification (proteomics) and metabolite profiling (metabolomics). Thus, the system can be integrated with other biomedical instruments in order to support and enhance telemedicine capability onboard ISS. NASA's mission includes sustained investment in critical research leading to effective countermeasures to minimize the risks associated with human spaceflight, and the use of appropriate technology to sustain space exploration at reasonable cost. Our integrated microarray technology is expected to fulfill these two critical requirements and to enable the scientific community to better understand and monitor the effects of the space environment on microorganisms and on the astronaut, in the process leveraging current capabilities and overcoming present limitations.

20170000272,ABSTRACT,Mind the Gap: Exploring the Underground of the NASA Space Cancer Risk Model,"[""Chappell, L. J."",""Elgart, S. R."",""Milder, C. M."",""Shavers, M. R."",""Semones, E. J."",""Huff, J. L.""]","The REID quantifies the lifetime risk of death from radiation-induced cancer in an exposed astronaut. The NASA Space Cancer Risk (NSCR) 2012 mode incorporates elements from physics, biology, epidemiology, and statistics to generate the REID distribution. The current model quantifies the space radiation environment, radiation quality, and dose-rate effects to estimate a NASA-weighted dose. This weighted dose is mapped to the excess risk of radiation-induced cancer mortality from acute exposures to gamma rays and then transferred to an astronaut population. Finally, the REID is determined by integrating this risk over the individual's lifetime. The calculated upper 95% confidence limit of the REID is used to restrict an astronaut's permissible mission duration (PMD) for a proposed mission. As a statistical quantity characterized by broad, subjective uncertainties, REID estimates for space missions result in wide distributions. Currently, the upper 95% confidence level is over 350% larger than the mean REID value, which can severely limit an astronaut's PMD. The model incorporates inputs from multiple scientific disciplines in the risk estimation process. Physics and particle transport models calculate how radiation moves through space, penetrates spacecraft, and makes its way to the human beings onboard. Epidemiological studies of exposures from atomic bombings, medical treatments, and power plants are used to quantify health risks from acute and chronic low linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation. Biological studies in cellular and animal models using radiation at various LETs and energies inform quality metrics for ions present in space radiation. Statistical methodologies unite these elements, controlling for mathematical and scientific uncertainty and variability. Despite current progress, these research platforms contain knowledge gaps contributing to the large uncertainties still present in the model. The NASA Space Radiation Program Element (SRPE) defines the knowledge gaps that impact our understanding of the cancer risks. These gaps are outlined in NASA's Human Research Roadmap [4], which identifies the research questions and actions recommended for reducing the uncertainty in the current NSCR model and for formulation of future models. The greatest contributors to uncertainty in the current model include radiation quality, dose rate effects, and the transfer of exposure-based risk from other populations to an astronaut population. Future formulations of the risk model may benefit from including other potential sources of uncertainty such as space dosimetry, errors in human epidemiology data, and the impact of microgravity and other spaceflight stressors. Here, we discuss the current capabilities of the NSCR-2012 model and several immediate research needs, highlighting areas expected to have an operational impact on the current model schema. The following subway-style route map outlines the NSCR-2012 model (Green Line), emphasizing the research gaps in the Human Research Roadmap for risk of radiation-induced carcinogenesis (Stops on Dashed Lines).

20110001661,ABSTRACT,Biological Based Risk Assessment for Space Exploration,"[""Cucinotta, Francis A.""]","Exposures from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) - made up of high-energy protons and high-energy and charge (HZE) nuclei, and solar particle events (SPEs) - comprised largely of low- to medium-energy protons are the primary health concern for astronauts for long-term space missions. Experimental studies have shown that HZE nuclei produce both qualitative and quantitative differences in biological effects compared to terrestrial radiation, making risk assessments for cancer and degenerative risks, such as central nervous system effects and heart disease, highly uncertain. The goal for space radiation protection at NASA is to be able to reduce the uncertainties in risk assessments for Mars exploration to be small enough to ensure acceptable levels of risks are not exceeded and to adequately assess the efficacy of mitigation measures such as shielding or biological countermeasures. We review the recent BEIR VII and UNSCEAR-2006 models of cancer risks and their uncertainties. These models are shown to have an inherent 2-fold uncertainty as defined by ratio of the 95% percent confidence level to the mean projection, even before radiation quality is considered. In order to overcome the uncertainties in these models, new approaches to risk assessment are warranted. We consider new computational biology approaches to modeling cancer risks. A basic program of research that includes stochastic descriptions of the physics and chemistry of radiation tracks and biochemistry of metabolic pathways, to emerging biological understanding of cellular and tissue modifications leading to cancer is described.","[{""submissionId"":20110001661,""id"":""69648845653e44248b4c6cd57c1e091a"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110001661,""endDate"":""2011-03-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""NCRP Annual Meeting"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""70ccbb90260041a6847e94fc68a72387"",""startDate"":""2011-03-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110001661

In-space microbial manufacturing could generate many important compounds (such as nutrients, pharmaceuticals and fuels) but there are significant barriers to deploying reliable bioproduction platforms to space. These include ensuring adequate production and proper purification of the desired product, especially in the unique radiation and microgravity environment. Here we are focused on developing methods and technologies to feed microbial factories using the resources available in space. CO2, found in abundance in spacecraft cabins and the Mars atmosphere, can be sequestered and converted into bioproducts. While autotrophic organisms can use CO2 directly, they are generally slow growing and have less-developed biotechnology toolkits. Therefore we are developing an alternative paradigm in which CO2 is first reduced to more energetic carbon compounds that can support more rapid growth of workhorse biotechnology platforms (E. coli, S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris).Various technologies exist or are being developed to convert CO2. For example, the Sabatier system currently installed on the ISS, reacts CO2 and H2 to generate CH4 and H2O. This methane could be consumed by engineered methanotrophic bacteria. Alternatively, electrochemical systems can convert CO2 into formate (CHO2) which could be consumed by formatotrophic bacteria. In either case, synthetic biology techniques allow these microbes to serve as reprogrammable biofactories capable of producing a vast number or products.","[{""submissionId"":20180007524,""id"":""f7f9497ea2f4491986796ecf53a84b89"",""publicationDate"":""2018-10-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20180007524,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States"",""id"":""7451b431c9844be9998fc608acaa3ef5""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180007524,""endDate"":""2018-11-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9723896c1b994896b4a8035161117dda"",""id"":""dc913623f4c84f858690320d12643985""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) Meeting 2018"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""9723896c1b994896b4a8035161117dda"",""startDate"":""2018-10-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180007524

Organizing the data for such analysis is a challenge because of its diverse nature (molecular, cellular, tissue, whole organism, behavior; tabular, imagery).

Open Science is the concept that the more people have access to scientifically curated data, the more knowledge will be gained. This led NASA to start the development of GeneLab in 2015. GeneLab houses spaceflight and space-analog multi-omics datasets from plant, rodent, small animal, and microbial experiments. The success and knowledge gained from GeneLab led to a new alliance of NASA “Open Science Data Repositories” (OSDR), which include the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) and the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC). Both are adopting the GeneLab data system, so data are more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). OSDR systems provide users the ability to upload, download, search, share, analyze, and visualize.

Open Science also needs strong confidence in the data, which is gained through building science communities. With ~400 current members, GeneLab and ALSDA formed Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) to provide feedback on processing pipelines, metadata curation standards (for ‘omics and phenotypic-physiological-behavioral assays), and to collaborate in effectively reusing data. The AWG also led to the development of the Radiation Biology Ontology (RBO), ensuring radiation metadata are efficiently captured, connected, and interoperable. Feedback from the AWG provided design input toward the new single point-of-entry data submission portal for all investigators to submit, curate, and share their research data.

Space biological data is now maximally open access, collected-curated with rich metadata, and formatted for interoperability to enable systems biology, meta-analysis, knowledge graphs, machine learning, modeling, and other reuse approaches. With potential for further federation of OSDR for data mining with traditional biological and medical databases (NIH, NCI, EBI, etc.), a new era for space biology has begun to support the knowledge discovery necessary for Lunar and Martian missions.

Because of the directionality of radiation fields caused by the Earth shadow, trapped radiation pitch angle distribution, and inherent variations in the ISS shielding, a model is needed to account for these local variations in the radiation distribution. We present the calculated radiation dose (rem/yr) values for over 3,000 different points in the working area of the Lab module and estimated radiation dose values for over 25,000 different points in the human body for a given ambient radiation environment. These estimated radiation dose values are presented in a three dimensional animated interactive visualization format.

The need for countermeasures to protect future astronauts from the unique conditions of space is ever-pressing and an assessment of bioproduction capabilities in space is a crucial step for sustaining long-term missions.

The Lunar Explorer Instrument for space biology Applications (LEIA) aims to investigate the cell’s response to the lunar environment and test strategies for enhancing cellular tolerance on the Moon, utilizing the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a biosensor.

S. cerevisiae serves as an excellent model organism due to its widespread use as an analog for human cells, well-characterized set of genetic tools, and ability to survive desiccation. However, these cells must remain desiccated for up to one year prior to launch and the radiation-sensitive strains designed for LEIA will likely be more vulnerable to desiccation effects. In this work, we introduce tardigrade proteins known for their protective mechanisms into potential LEIA strains to test genetic strategies for improving desiccation and radiation tolerance.

Tardigrades are extremotolerant animals well-known for their ability to survive in harsh environments. Notably, they can survive extreme desiccation and radiation due to the upregulation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). It has been shown that integration of these tardigrade IDPs, such as cytosolic abundant heat-soluble (CAHS) proteins, into yeast can confer increased desiccation tolerance in synergy with trehalose.

Our ongoing testing and assessment of bioengineered radiation and desiccation tolerance will help us gain insight into optimizing strain design and selection for protecting LEIA’s biological payload as well as genetic engineering strategies for enhancing bioproduction potential for future missions beyond low Earth orbit.

Results from the first six missions are presented and discussed. The missions had orbital inclinations ranging from 28 degrees to 57 degrees, and altitudes from 200-600km. Dose equivalent rates ranged from 40-5300 micro Sv/dy. The RME-III measurements are in good agreement with other dosimetry measurements made aboard the vehicle. Measurements indicate that medium- and high- Linear Energy Transfer (LET) particles contribute less than 2% of the particle fluence for all missions, but up to 50% of the dose equivalent, depending on the spacecraft's altitude and orbital inclination. Isa-dose rate contours have been developed from measurements made during the ST-28 mission. The drift rate of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is estimated to be 0.49 degrees W/yr and 0.12 degrees N/yr.

Historically the major impediment to radiation cataract follow-up has been the necessarily subjective nature of assessing the degree of lens transparency. This has spurred the development of instruments which produce video images amenable to digital analysis. One such system, the Zeiss Scheimpflug slit lamp measuring system (SLC), was incorporated into our ongoing studies of radiation cataractogenesis. It was found that the Zeiss SLC measuring system has high resolution and permits the acquisition of reproducible images of the anterior segment of the eye. Our results, based on about 650 images of the rats lens, and followed over a period of 91 weeks of radiation cataract development, showed that the Integrated Optical Density (IOD) of the lens correlated well with conventional assessment with the added advantages of objectivity, permanent and transportable records and linearity as cataracts become more severe. This continuous data acquisition, commencing with cataract onset, can proceed through more advanced stages. The SLC exhibits much greater sensitivity reflected in a continuously progressive severity despite the artifactual plateaus in staging which occur using conventional scoring methods. Systems such as the Zeiss SLC should be used to monitor astronauts frequent visits to low earth orbit to obtain a longitudinal data-base on the influence of this activity on the lens.","[{""volume"":""14"",""submissionId"":19940039076,""issue"":""10"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""6d943f21a92f4c338b34c07e8acc1a47"",""publicationName"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1"",""publicationDate"":""1994-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""EY02648"",""DE-FG02-90ER61009"",""NAG-9-256/S2""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""},{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940039076
20190030357,PRESENTATION,Systemic Alterations with Spaceflight Associated Health Risks Originating from Both Circulating miRNAs and Mitochondrial Biology,"[""Beheshti, Afshin""]","The many known health risks currently associated with space travel include increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, central nervous system related diseases, muscle degeneration, and changes with host-gut microbiome interactions that can have profound impact with these and other health risks. The majority of the risk from space travel stem of the two components of the space environment which are microgravity and radiation. Two specific systemic effects have been uncovered by us to impact the body as a whole due to the space environment. One factor is related from our earlier work (Beheshti et al, PLOS One, 2018), we predicted that there is a systemic component of the host that causes general increased health risks due to spaceflight driven by a circulating microRNA (miRNA) signature consisting of 13 miRNAs that directly regulates both p53 and TGF1. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules with a negative and post-transcriptional regulation on gene expression) are increasingly recognized as major systemic regulators of responses to stressors, including microgravity, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. In addition, due to the size and stability of miRNAs, it is known that miRNAs can circulate throughout the body and have been found in the majority of the bodily fluids including blood, urine, saliva, and tears. Here, we start to dissect the actual impact of this miRNA signature on both the radiation and microgravity components and prove that this miRNA signature actually exists in the circulation of a host. The other systemic factor we uncovered was the impact the mitochondria on the whole body due to spaceflight. We hypothesize that spaceflight may promote a physiologic response driven by systemic mitochondria pathways leading to metabolic disorder stemming from the liver and directly impacting other organs and tissues. A systems biology method was implemented utilizing GeneLab datasets that involved in vitro experiments performed at the low Earth orbit, in vivo experiments involving mice flown to space, and finally human physiological data from astronauts. A comprehensive multi-omics approach was implemented which involved correlating transcriptomic analysis with proteomics, metabolomics, and methylation analysis. This approach led us to confirm our hypothesis that a systemic mitochondrial driven response is responsible for increasing potential health risk and is conserved from the in vitro studies, to the in vivo studies, and finally confirmed in astronauts.","[{""submissionId"":20190030357,""id"":""029a6220eca64030bcd65d1849c42d28"",""publicationDate"":""2019-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190030357

At present, only a few properties are reliably retrieved from space, either directly or via water-leaving radiance. Existing satellite products are limited to planar photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet (UV) irradiance above the surface and diffuse attenuation coefficient. Examples of operational products are provided, and their advantages and drawbacks are examined. The usefulness and convenience of these products notwithstanding, there is a need, as expressed by the user community, for other products, i.e., sub-surface planar and scalar fluxes, average cosine, spectral fluxes (UV to visible), diurnal fluxes, absorbed fraction of PAR by live algae (APAR), surface albedo, vertical attenuation, and heating rate, and for associating uncertainties to any product on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Methodologies to obtain the new products are qualitatively discussed in view of most recent scientific knowledge and current and future satellite missions, and specific algorithms are presented for some new products, namely sub-surface fluxes and average cosine. A strategy and roadmap (short, medium, and long term) for usage and development priorities is provided, taking into account needs and readiness level. Combining observations from satellites overpassing at different times and geostationary satellites should be pursued to improve the quality of daily-integrated radiation fields, and products should be generated without gaps to provide boundary conditions for general circulation and biogeochemical models. Examples of new products, i.e., daily scalar PAR below the surface, daily average cosine for PAR, and sub-surface spectral scalar fluxes are presented. A procedure to estimate algorithm uncertainties in the total uncertainty budget for above-surface daily PAR, based on radiative simulations for expected situations, is described. In the future, space-borne lidars with ocean profiling capability offer the best hope for improving our knowledge of sub-surface fields. To maximize temporal coverage, space agencies should consider placing ocean-color instruments in L1 orbit, where the sunlit part of the Earth can be frequently observed.","[{""volume"":""5"",""submissionId"":20180004087,""publisher"":""Ocean Observation"",""eissn"":""2296-7745"",""id"":""cfd93a4025964d11b239bac5303d85a6"",""publicationName"":""Frontiers in Marine Science"",""publicationDate"":""2018-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNX14AL91G""]",undefined,"[""Oceanography""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180004087

Open access space biology data enables scientists to examine the biological responses of plants to ionizing radiation, altered gravity, low atmospheric pressure, elevated CO2, altered photoperiods and many other abiotic stressors. Open Science is the practice of making research available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, and fostering collaborations with equity. 2023 is the ‘Year of Open Science’, and NASA has a 5-year Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative designed to rapidly transform the agency toward an inclusive culture of open science. NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) within NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division provides access to data from space-relevant biological experiments. OSDR combines two databases, GeneLab and Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) to maximize access to standardized ‘omics (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) and phenotypic data (e.g., microscopy, biomass), respectively. GeneLab started in 2014 with the creation of the first space-relevant FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) biological ‘omics repository, providing detailed metadata on investigation, sample, and assay levels. The addition of ALSDA to OSDR expands plant data analysis capabilities across both phenotypic and ‘omics data. Today, OSDR hosts 62+ plant datasets and has enabled 58 peer-reviewed publications. Most of these publications were collaboration efforts under the OSDR Analysis Working Groups (AWGs). AWGs provide great opportunities for investigators to collaborate and set new standards for space-relevant data and metadata. The AWGs welcome any ASPB members interested in contributing plant expertise for space biology, and to serve as subject matter experts as we establish the framework for modern plant data archiving. Investigators are invited to submit their space-relevant plant datasets to OSDR and visit the site to learn about the tools OSDR has to offer (osdr.nasa.gov/bio).",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230009113,""endDate"":""2023-08-09T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""1dd913a5c8de5bbdb97ef028fe28498e"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society of Plant Biologists"",""location"":""Rockville, Maryland, United States""}},""meetingId"":""459404e5026241aa8ff44a81fd16b4ac"",""id"":""3f4d8e0e2992434fb491e72ed4dc85fa""}],""name"":""Plant Biology 2023"",""location"":""Savannah, GA"",""id"":""459404e5026241aa8ff44a81fd16b4ac"",""url"":""https://plantbiology.aspb.org/"",""startDate"":""2023-08-05T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.06.01.02.01.02""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230009113

To do this, GeneLab maintains a publicly accessible database (GLDS) that houses spaceflight and spaceflight relevant multi-omics data and collaborates with NASA principal investigators and projects to generate additional omics data. GeneLab houses more than 350 transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and epigenomic datasets from plant, animal and microbial experiments, with a growing number of these having been produced by the GeneLab Sequencing Lab. The GLDS contains rich metadata about each experiment and has integrated radiation dosimetry data from experiments flown on the Space Shuttle, International Space Station, and Free Flying spacecrafts.
With the increasing amount and complexity of omics data being generated, GeneLab utilizes community-defined, common models for metadata and terminology so that omics data and results are discoverable and reliably reproducible. GeneLab uses the ISA-Tab specification and semantic model for organizing and representing omics metadata. In addition to metadata standards, data files must be open-source file or common exchange formats to ensure accessibility and usability by all users. To ease data ingestion and transfer, the web-based submission tool allows PIs a user-friendly user interface to curate, organize, and publish their space relevant omics data. In the more recent years, data curation and submission portal has incorporated the FAIR principles making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.
To increase reusability of data, GeneLab has implemented an effort to present processed data in the GLDS in addition to the raw omics data. The processed data will enable interpretation of the data by a larger group of students, scientists and the general public. Standard pipelines for the transformation of raw data into visualizations were developed by four GeneLab Analysis Working Groups (animals, plants, microbes, multi-omics) comprised of over 200 scientists from NASA, industry, and academia. To explore the data, the GLDS provides users various tools for data analysis, collaborative workspace for file storage and sharing, and a visualization portal. The analysis platform built using the Galaxy toolshed provides access to a broad variety of users including those with limited bioinformatics experience and students to learn how to analyze spaceflight omics data. The visualization portal takes GeneLab one step closer to data democratization by removing all bioinformatics requisites to interpret transcriptomics data hosted in the repository. To train the next generation of scientists, NASA offers training programs such as GeneLab 4 High School (GL4HS) and GeneLab 4 Universities.

Epidemiological data are lacking and risk methods do not take individual radiation sensitivity into account. In our approach we hypothesize that genetic factors strongly influence risk of cancer from space radiation and that biomarkers reflecting DNA damage and cell death are ideal tools to predict risk and monitor potential health effects post-flight. At this workshop, we will be reporting the work we have done over the first 9 months of this proposal. Skin cells from 15 different strains of mice already characterized for radiation-induced cancer sensitivity (B6C3F; BALB/cByJ, C57BL/6J, CBA/CaJ, C3H/HeMsNrsf), and 10 strains from the DOE collaborative cross-mouse model were expanded from ear biopsy and cultivated until Passage 3. On average, 3 males and 3 females for each strain were expanded and frozen for further characterization at the NSRL beam line during the NSRL16C run for three LET (350 MeV/n Si, 350 MeV/n Ar and 600 MeV/n Fe) and two ion fluences (1 and 3 particles per cell). The mice work has established new metrics for the usage of Radiation Induced Foci as a marker for various aspect of DNA repair deficiencies. In year 2, we propose to continue characterization of the mouse lines with low LET to identify loci specific to high- versus low- LET and establish genetic linkage for the various DNA repair biomarkers. Correlation with cancer risk from each animals strain and gender will also be investigated. On the human side, we will start characterizing the DNA damage response induced ex-vivo in 200 human's blood donors for radiation sensitivity with a tentative 500 donors by the end of this project. All ex-vivo phenotypic data will be correlated to genetic characterization of each individual human donors using SNP arrays characterization as done for mice. Similarly, ex-vivo phenotypic features from mice will be associated to cancer risk, to identify which biomarkers correlate the most with cancer risk. Genetic traits across humans will also be associated to radiation phenotypic features as a function of age and gender.","[{""submissionId"":20170000926,""id"":""95123f48070542569cae1a712cbaa4d4"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170000926,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""a03ed2573e2f454e90fe4df62236b539"",""id"":""b6331949eb124b2895bd0055ea5c3f8a""}],""name"":""2017 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""a03ed2573e2f454e90fe4df62236b539"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Radiation"",""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170000926

So far, astronauts rely heavily on prepackaged, heat stabilized foods with no ability to “cook” or refrigerate foods or their ingredients.  Fresh produce and other perishable food items are only available for a short period after the arrival of cargo vessel.  The current ISS food system is designed to supply foods for less than three years, while Mars missions will require foods having at least a five-year shelf life.  Plant growth systems can produce fresh, nutrient rich foods and offer other benefits.  Currently plant and other systems are being explored as ways to provide fresh food, vitamins and other essential nutrients to crews, particularly ones with shorter shelf lives or that reduce radiation damage.

Ways and mean for attaining these goals are suggested. The report emphasizes that a stronger life sciences program is imperative if the U.S. space policy is to construct a permanently manned space station and achieve its stated goal of expanding the human presence beyond earth orbit into the solar system. The same considerations apply in regard to the other major goal of life sciences: to study the biological processes and life in the universe. A principal recommendation of the report is for NASA to expand its program of ground- and space-based research contributing to resolving questions about physiological deconditioning, radiation exposure, potential psychological difficulties, and life support requirements that may limit stay times for personnel on the Space Station and complicate missions of more extended duration. Other key recommendations call for strengthening programs of biological systems research in: controlled ecological life support systems for humans in space, earth systems central to understanding the effects on the earth's environment of both natural and human activities, and exobiology.","[{""submissionId"":19900005462,""id"":""8f3481963e314c5fb3b1a8c7df5fa8d3"",""publicationDate"":""1988-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Biology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19900005462

To investigate the factors contributing to the break point distribution in radiation-induced chromosome aberrations, human epithelial cells were fixed in G1 phase. Interphase chromosomes were hybridized with a multicolor banding in situ hybridization (mBAND) probe for chromosome 3 which distinguishes six regions of the chromosome in separate colors. After the images were captured with a laser scanning confocal microscope, the 3-dimensional structure of interphase chromosome 3 was reconstructed at multimega base pair scale. Specific locations of the chromosome, in interphase, were also analyzed with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes. Both mBAND and BAC studies revealed non-random folding of chromatin in interphase, and suggested association of interphase chromatin folding to the radiation-induced chromosome aberration hotspots. We further investigated the distribution of genes, as well as the distribution of breaks found in tumor cells. Comparisons of these distributions to the radiation hotspots showed that some of the radiation hotspots coincide with the frequent breaks found in solid tumors and with the fragile sites for other environmental toxins. Our results suggest that multiple factors, including the chromatin structure and the gene distribution, can contribute to radiation-induced chromosome aberrations.","[{""submissionId"":20130013689,""id"":""ec37aa919e4f4322a19eee7bdfa53f58"",""publicationDate"":""2013-05-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20130013689,""name"":""European

Astronauts consume almost three times the recommended daily allowance of iron due to the use of fortifie d foods aboard the International Space Station, with iron intake occa sionally exceeding six times the recommended values. Recently, NASA has become concerned with visual changes associated with spaceflight, a nd research is being conducted to elucidate the etiology of eye structure alterations in the spaceflight environment. Terrestrially, iron o verload is also associated with certain optic neuropathies. In additi on, due to its role in Fenton reactions, iron can potentiate oxidative stress, which is a recognized cause of cataract formation. As part o f a study investigating the combined effects of radiation exposure an d iron overload on multiple physiological systems, we focused on defining the effects of both treatments on eye biology. In this study, 12- week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four experimental groups: normal iron/no radiation (Control/Sham), high iron/no radiat ion (Fe/Sham), normal iron/gamma radiation (3 Gy cumulative dose, fra ctionated at 0.375 Gy/d every other day for 16 d) (Control/Rad), and high iron/gamma radiation (Fe/Rad).

Increased dietary iron and radiation expos ure had an interactive effect (P = 0.02) on 8OHdG immunostaining of t he retinal ganglion cell layer with iron diet increasing the signal in the group not exposed to radiation (P = 0.05). qPCR gene expression  profiling of relevant target genes indicated upregulation of ferritin light chain (P = 0.09) as a result of dietary iron but no change in e xpression of the gene for ferritin heavy chain. Immunolocalization of  light chain and heavy chain of the iron storage protein ferritin showed the expected distribution in the choroid, photoreceptor layer, inn er nuclear layer and in the inner plexiform layer that corresponded t o the synaptic terminals of bipolar cells. Evidence of stress and damage in the retina was also suggested by a decrease in expression of th e survival marker Bcl2 (P = 0.01) and the protective proteins clusterin (P = 0.04) and heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1, P < 0.001), as a result o f increased dietary iron. The effect of increased iron on expression  of the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) had a significant interaction with the effect of radiation (P < 0.001). In summary, the  results of this study indicate that both gamma radiation exposure and a moderate increase in dietary iron can contribute to deleterious cha nges in retinal health and physiology.","[{""submissionId"":20130000330,""id"":""ebd86d5931ee4992a27a98a0323e3969"",""publicationDate"":""2012-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20130000330,""endDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""HRP Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""b7d14d51cce64d6fb099238d972e27cc"",""startDate"":""2012-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20130000330
20210014163,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Worswick Hot Springs: A Radioactive Hydrothermal Field Site. ,"[""J. C. Rask"",""K. F. Bywaters"",""T. S. Magnuson ""]","Introduction: We report on a systematic characterization of the environmental conditions at Worswick Hot Springs, a hydrothermal system in Idaho, USA.         

Because localized “hot spots” of elevated radiation and biofilms are easily accessible, various biological studies of radiation resistance and biosignature formation are possible, making this fieldsite relevant for analog field studies that consider microbiology, geo-chemistry, and ionizing radiation. In addition to Worswick being a natural radiation biology laboratory that may also be relevant for space biology applications, we assert that these unusual environmental conditions may inform us about locations on Mars that are also enriched in radioactive elements and their poten-tial for hosting biosignatures.
Methods:  We carried out repeated temperature and radiation measurements at the same hot spring locations to observe the system over time (Figure 2). Radiation: A Bicron Micro Analyst micro-r-meter (Bicron NE, Saint-Gobain Industrial Ceramics, Inc.) capable of sensing x-rays and gamma-rays (0-5000 µR/hr), was used to gather radiation data at twenty-four locations around and above the region of the two main stream channels. Water Temperature:  A digital hand-held infrared thermometer (Oakton WD-39642-00 Mini-Temp Tester) was used for all measurements. ICP-MS aqueous geochemistry: Water samples were analyzed at the ISU Center for Archaeology, Materials and Applied Spectroscopy (CAMAS).
Results:  We have discovered localized areas of elevated radiation that are approximately 4 to 5 times greater than background radiation, and we have ob-served that both radioactivity and temperature of the spring waters vary over time. ICP-MS reveal the presence of thorium and uranium, which are correlated with elevated radioactivity. Several point sources of elevated radioactivity have been identified in both Stream A and Stream B.

20210000690,PRESENTATION,Lunar BioSensor: An Autonomous Instrument to Study the Effects of the Lunar Environment on Biological Organisms,"[""Sergio R Santa Maria""]","One of the major challenges to long-duration space travel and habitation in deep space is an in-depth understanding of the biological effects of space radiation, often convoluted by the impact of reduced gravity. Nonetheless, due to the near impossibility of simulating prolonged exposure to these combined effects in terrestrial facilities, actual missions are needed to characterize the radiobiological hazards of this environment. NASA Ames has been the leader in developing autonomous bio nanosatellites to address strategic knowledge gaps about the effects of space travel on biological organisms, including GeneSat, PharmaSat, EcAMSat, and BioSentinel. BioSentinel will be the first interplanetary bio nanosatellite or CubeSat to study the biological response to space radiation outside Low Earth Orbit (LEO). BioSentinel is an autonomous platform able to support biology and to investigate the effects of space radiation on a model organism in interplanetary deep space. It will fly onboard NASA’s Artemis-1, from which it will be deployed on a lunar fly-by trajectory and into a heliocentric orbit. The BioSentinel nanosatellite, a 6U deep space CubeSat (1U = 10-cm cube), will measure the DNA damage and response to ambient space radiation in a model biological organism, the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, which will be compared to information provided by an onboard physical radiation sensor and to data obtained in LEO (on the ISS) and on Earth. Even though the primary objective of the mission is to develop an autonomous spacecraft capable of conducting biological experiments in deep space, the 4U BioSensor science payload contained within the 6U free-flyer is an adaptable instrument platform that can perform biological measurements with different microorganisms and in multiple space environments, including the ISS, lunar gateway, and on the surface of the Moon. The proposed 4U instrument will leverage the payload design of the 6U free-flyer, utilizing the lunar lander or vehicle for power and data relay. Thus, nanosatellites like BioSentinel (and Lunar BioSensor) can be used to study the effects of both reduced gravity and space radiation and can house different bio organisms to answer specific science questions. In addition to their flexibility, nanosatellites also provide a low-cost alternative to more complex and larger missions, and require minimal crew support, if any.

Open access space biology data enables scientists to examine the biological responses of plants to ionizing radiation, altered gravity, low atmospheric pressure, elevated CO2, altered photoperiods and many other abiotic stressors. Open Science is the practice of making research available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, to foster collaborations with equity. NASA has declared 2023 as the ‘Year of Open Science’ and created a 5-year Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative designed to rapidly transform the agency toward an inclusive culture of open science. NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) within the Biological and Physical Sciences Division provides access to data from space-relevant biological experiments. OSDR combines two databases, GeneLab and Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) to maximize access to standardized ‘omics (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) and phenotypic data (e.g., microscopy, biomass), respectively. GeneLab started in 2014 with the creation of the first space-relevant FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) biological ‘omics repository, providing detailed metadata on investigation, sample, and assay levels. The addition of ALSDA to OSDR expands plant data analysis capabilities across both phenotypic and ‘omics data. Today, OSDR hosts 62+ plant datasets and has enabled 58 peer-reviewed publications. Most of these publications were collaboration efforts under the OSDR Analysis Working Groups (AWGs). AWGs provide great opportunities for investigators to collaborate with community members and set new standards for space-relevant data and metadata. The AWGs welcome any ASGSR members interested in contributing plant expertise for space biology, and to serve as subject matter experts as we establish the framework for modern plant data archiving. Investigators are encouraged to submit their space-relevant plant datasets to OSDR and visit the site to learn about the tools OSDR has to offer (osdr.nasa.gov/bio).",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230016193,""endDate"":""2023-11-18T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""63eaf498bc60420ca72bb099da1183a3"",""id"":""884b0bbd0acf4e748625b2113dd566be""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""63eaf498bc60420ca72bb099da1183a3"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2023-meeting/"",""startDate"":""2023-11-14T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Documentation and Information Science""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230016193

In this work, a cell death model is applied to several cell lines exposed to HZE ions spanning a broad range of linear energy transfer (LET) values. We hypothesize that chromatin movement leads to the clustering of multiple double strand breaks (DSB) within one radiation-induced foci (RIF). The survival probability of a cell population is determined by averaging the survival probabilities of individual cells, which is function of the number of pairwise DSB interactions within RIF. The simulation code RITCARD was used to compute DSB. Two clustering approaches were applied to determine the number of RIF per cell. RITCARD outputs were combined with experimental data from four normal human cell lines to derive the model parameters and expand its predictions in response to ions with LET ranging from ∼0.2keV/μmto∼3000keV/μm. Spherical and ellipsoidal nuclear shapes and two ion beam orientations were modeled to assess the impact of geometrical properties on cell death. The calculated average number of RIF per cell reproduces the saturation trend for high doses and high-LET values that is usually experimentally observed. The cell survival model generates the recognizable bell shape of LET dependence for the relative biological effectiveness (RBE). At low LET, smaller nuclei have lower survival due to increased DNA density and DSB clustering. At high LET, nuclei with a smaller irradiation area either because of a smaller size or a change in beam orientation have a higher survival rate due to a change in the distribution of DSB/RIF per cell. If confirmed experimentally, the geometric characteristics of cells would become a significant factor in predicting radiation-induced biological effects.","[{""volume"":""16"",""submissionId"":20230011398,""issn"":""1757-9694"",""publisher"":""Oxford University Press (United Kingdom)"",""eissn"":""1757-9708"",""id"":""98f026b3833348ac9620b6b28699b1c7"",""publicationName"":""Integrative Biology"",""publicationDate"":""2024-09-19T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""issuePublicationDate"":""2024-09-19T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""doi"":""10.1093/intbio/zyae015""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""80LARC17C0004"",""NNJ15HK11B"",""NNL15AA081"",""NNJ16HP24I"",""NNX16AO69A"",""DE-AC02-05CH11231"",""80LARC23DA003""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Space Radiation"",""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230011398

BioSentinel’s goals are to assess the effect of deep space ionizing radiation (IR) on DNA and cell damage response, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or budding yeast, as a model organism. BioSentinel accomplishes this by measuring Optical Density (OD) in addition to metabolic activity using the redox dye alamarBlue, both of which will be read through light emitting diode (LED) lights of differing wavelengths. With the largest and most sophisticated energy-providing solar panels utilized on a biological CubeSat to date, BioSentinel will be equipped with an IR dosimeter to identify what doses of radiation the yeast is exposed to at any point in time, in addition to a transponder to send such data back to NASA Ames’ Multi Mission Operations Center (MMOC). Biology computational programs and data processing scripts are necessary to analyze this complex data once it is received, including automated subroutines to analyze duplication rate, alamarBlue reduction, and time periods when paired against numerous other variables. Overall,
we have implemented several VisualBasic biocomputational programs to analyze such data in an organized and efficient manner so that conclusions can be made rapidly.

Costes""]","Increased biomedical risks and challenges associated with deep space missions (cis-Lunar, Mars transit, Mars surface) require new knowledge discovery and development of novel ecosystem and biomedical support capabilities. This paradigm shift supporting distant and long-duration missions requires biological data to be findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR), and maximally open-access (i.e., there is a data governance continuum from closed to mediated to embargoed to open). The NASA “Open Science Data Repositories” (OSDR) aims to meet scientific, technical, and operational spaceflight needs, and offers the ability to upload, download, search, share, analyze, and visualize data across physiological, behavioral, ‘omics, and environmental monitoring telemetry datasets. OSDR includes NASA GeneLab, NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA), and NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC).

In the past year, ALSDA has undergone a transformation in its data collection, curation, and architecture methods. Standardizing non-genomic (phenotypic) datasets was, and will continue to be, a challenge because of their diverse nature (e.g., molecular, cellular, tissue, whole organism behavior; micro-computed tomography, intraocular pressure, fluorescence microscopy, western blot, ultrasonography; tabular, images, video). This year ALSDA, alongside GeneLab, introduced the Biological Data Management Environment (BDME) with the purpose to accept submission of data from space relevant experiments including spaceflight, radiation, simulated gravity, gravitropism, isolation and confinement, hostile closed environments and/or distance from Earth. In addition to bringing together omics, phenotypic, physiological, bioimaging, and behavioral data into one repository. By integrating with GeneLab a multi-project submission portal aims to reduce the burden on PIs submitting data and enabling the discovery of both omics and phenotypic data.

The purpose of ALSDA is to collect, curate, and make all non-human space-relevant biological data maximally findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). These scope of ALSDA data collected and submitted by PIs include study design metadata, subject metadata, assay metadata (parameters), raw and processed assay data, assay imagery/video, and subject-experienced mission data telemetry (radiation, temperature, humidity, acoustics, vibrations, etc.). In 2021, a community of researchers rallied to form the ALSDA Analysis Working Group (AWG) and provided scientific consensus on dataset sample and assay metadata.

20080029287,ABSTRACT,Space Life Sciences at NASA: Spaceflight Health Policy and Standards,"[""Davis, Jeffrey R."",""House, Nancy G.""]","In January 2005, the President proposed a new initiative, the Vision for Space Exploration. To accomplish the goals within the vision for space exploration, physicians and researchers at Johnson Space Center are establishing spaceflight health standards. These standards include fitness for duty criteria (FFD), permissible exposure limits (PELs), and permissible outcome limits (POLs). POLs delineate an acceptable maximum decrement or change in a physiological or behavioral parameter, as the result of exposure to the space environment. For example cardiovascular fitness for duty standards might be a measurable clinical parameter minimum that allows successful performance of all required duties. An example of a permissible exposure limit for radiation might be the quantifiable limit of exposure over a given length of time (e.g. life time radiation exposure). An example of a permissible outcome limit might be the length of microgravity exposure that would minimize bone loss. The purpose of spaceflight health standards is to promote operational and vehicle design requirements, aid in medical decision making during space missions, and guide the development of countermeasures. Standards will be based on scientific and clinical evidence including research findings, lessons learned from previous space missions, studies conducted in space analog environments, current standards of medical practices, risk management data, and expert recommendations. To focus the research community on the needs for exploration missions, NASA has developed the Bioastronautics Roadmap. The Bioastronautics Roadmap, NASA's approach to identification of risks to human space flight, revised baseline was released in February 2005. This document was reviewed by the Institute of Medicine in November 2004 and the final report was received in October 2005. The roadmap defines the most important research and operational needs that will be used to set policy, standards (define acceptable risk), and implement an overall Risk Management and Analysis process. Currently NASA is drafting spaceflight health standards for neurosensory alterations, space radiation exposure, behavioral health, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular fitness, immunological compromise, bone demineralization, and nutrition.","[{""submissionId"":20080029287,""id"":""3b521536aacc4f3891821e3cb3cb5669"",""publicationDate"":""2006-06-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Russia"",""submissionId"":20080029287,""endDate"":""2006-06-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""13th Conference on Space Biology and Aerospace Medicine"",""location"":""Moscow"",""id"":""39d81b4c3bab497aba75dfd2d30a08d0"",""startDate"":""2006-06-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080029287

20090016156,OTHER,Development of a GCR Event-based Risk Model,"[""Cucinotta, Francis A."",""Ponomarev, Artem L."",""Plante, Ianik"",""Carra, Claudio"",""Kim, Myung-Hee""]","A goal at NASA is to develop event-based systems biology models of space radiation risks that will replace the current dose-based empirical models. Complex and varied biochemical signaling processes transmit the initial DNA and oxidative damage from space radiation into cellular and tissue responses. Mis-repaired damage or aberrant signals can lead to genomic instability, persistent oxidative stress or inflammation, which are causative of cancer and CNS risks. Protective signaling through adaptive responses or cell repopulation is also possible. We are developing a computational simulation approach to galactic cosmic ray (GCR) effects that is based on biological events rather than average quantities such as dose, fluence, or dose equivalent. The goal of the GCR Event-based Risk Model (GERMcode) is to provide a simulation tool to describe and integrate physical and biological events into stochastic models of space radiation risks. We used the quantum multiple scattering model of heavy ion fragmentation (QMSFRG) and well known energy loss processes to develop a stochastic Monte-Carlo based model of GCR transport in spacecraft shielding and tissue. We validated the accuracy of the model by comparing to physical data from the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). Our simulation approach allows us to time-tag each GCR proton or heavy ion interaction in tissue including correlated secondary ions often of high multiplicity. Conventional space radiation risk assessment employs average quantities, and assumes linearity and additivity of responses over the complete range of GCR charge and energies. To investigate possible deviations from these assumptions, we studied several biological response pathway models of varying induction and relaxation times including the ATM, TGF -Smad, and WNT signaling pathways. We then considered small volumes of interacting cells and the time-dependent biophysical events that the GCR would produce within these tissue volumes to estimate how GCR event rates mapped to biological signaling induction and relaxation times. We considered several hypotheses related to signaling and cancer risk, and then performed simulations for conditions where aberrant or adaptive signaling would occur on long-duration space mission. Our results do not support the conventional assumptions of dose, linearity and additivity. A discussion on how event-based systems biology models, which focus on biological signaling as the mechanism to propagate damage or adaptation, can be further developed for cancer and CNS space radiation risk projections is given.","[{""submissionId"":20090016156,""id"":""318282b24a2e47fc8822cf3eae623d41"",""publicationDate"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Germany"",""submissionId"":20090016156,""endDate"":""2009-06-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""531f19d7a69c43cf916693ec973d8052"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fuer Luft- und Raumfahrt"",""location"":""Cologne, Germany""}},""meetingId"":""990924e0068e4285b4c8333d70f132ed"",""id"":""a531f549c2664e2e8060fc22c306c23a""}],""name"":""Heavy Ions in Therapy and Space Symposium 2009"",""location"":""Cologne"",""id"":""990924e0068e4285b4c8333d70f132ed"",""startDate"":""2009-06-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090016156

M.""]","Solar flare protons share many radiological health characteristics of the inner Van Allen Belt protons, and both types of radiation pose serious dangers to a number of missions planned. It is appropriate to evaluate crew dose determination procedures in terms of the type of radiation responsible for the major part of the projected exposure, i.e., protons in the neighborhood of 100 MeV. Monitoring chromosome abnormalities in peripheral lymphocytes is one method to determine an individual's accumulated radiation dosage. Cell culture and harvest is a relatively simple procedure and is well within the capabilities of a station health facility, but the evaluation of prepared microscopic slides is a time consuming and subjective procedure. This project is part of an effort to demonstrate the utility of automated image processing and evaluation procedures in expediting dose evaluation. The initial goal of this project is to produce a set of reference chromosome spreads produced from control lymphocytes and from lymphocytes exposed in whole blood to protons or gamma rays. The results of manual and automated aberration scoring will ultimately be compared to test for systematic differences between the two evaluation procedures and between the two radiation qualities. Proton irradiations are performed at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Cyclotron Facility. Proton dosimetry is supplemented by TLD packets from and by assay of short-lived proton activation products in the irradiation blood samples.","[{""submissionId"":19860021959,""id"":""b81b194729c648fbac65a1ffe6f97f52"",""publicationName"":""NASA.

Scott"",""Danielle Lopez"",""Evelyn Wong"",""Alan Wood"",""Samrawit Getachew Gebre"",""Sylvain V Costes""]","Increased biomedical risks and challenges associated with deep space missions (cis-Lunar, Mars transit, Mars surface) require new knowledge discovery and development of novel ecosystem and biomedical support capabilities. This paradigm shift supporting distant and long-duration missions requires biological data to be findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR), and maximally open-access (i.e., there is a data governance continuum from closed to mediated to embargoed to open). The NASA “Open Science Data Repositories” (OSDR) aims to meet scientific, technical, and operational spaceflight needs, and offers the ability to upload, download, search, share, analyze, and visualize data across physiological, behavioral, ‘omics, and environmental monitoring telemetry datasets. OSDR includes NASA GeneLab, NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA), and NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC).

In the past year, ALSDA has undergone a transformation in its data collection, curation, and architecture methods. Standardizing non-genomic (phenotypic) datasets was, and will continue to be, a challenge because of their diverse nature (e.g., molecular, cellular, tissue, whole organism, behavior; micro-computed tomography, intraocular pressure, fluorescence microscopy, western blot, ultrasonography; tabular, images, video). This year ALSDA, alongside GeneLab, introduced the Biological Data Management Environment (BDME) with the purpose to accept submission of data from space relevant experiments including spaceflight, radiation, simulated gravity, gravitropism, isolation and confinement, hostile closed environments and/or distance from Earth. In addition to bringing together omics, phenotypic, physiological, bioimaging, and behavioral data into one repository. By integrating with GeneLab a multi-project submission portal aims to reduce the burden on PIs submitting data and enabling the discovery of both omics and phenotypic data.

The purpose of ALSDA is to collect, curate, and make all non-human space-relevant biological data maximally findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).  These scope of ALSDA data collected and submitted by PIs include study design metadata, subject metadata, assay metadata (parameters), raw and processed assay data, assay imagery/video, and subject-experienced mission data telemetry (radiation, temperature, humidity, acoustics, vibrations, etc.). In 2021, a community of researchers rallied to form the ALSDA Analysis Working Group (AWG) and provided scientific consensus on dataset sample and assay metadata. The community and excitement around the ALSDA/OSDR system has already led to several data reuse studies, demonstrating value using machine learning (ML), knowledge graphs, and meta-analysis approaches.

20220013811,PRESENTATION,Evolution of Biological Satellites: From Low Earth Orbit to NASA’s BioSentinel Deep Space Mission ,"[""Sergio R Santa Maria""]","NASA has set its sights on human exploration in deep space with the Artemis missions, with an ambitious plan to put astronauts back on the Moon and to eventually land human missions on Mars. Such missions will require significant countermeasures, likely both technological and biomedical, to protect biology from chronic radiation exposure. Small satellites like CubeSats can inform these countermeasures by querying relevant space environments with model organisms over relevant durations.

NASA has launched five biological CubeSats into low Earth orbit (LEO) from GeneSat in 2006 to EcAMSat in 2017. Each one of these missions increased our understanding of the effects of spaceflight, while refining technologies and imparting valuable lessons to the next generation of CubeSats. The Artemis I rocket will carry ten CubeSats, each of them with its own objective. One in particular, BioSentinel, will conduct the first study of the biological response to interplanetary space radiation beyond LEO since Apollo 17.

Once it reaches its heliocentric orbit – after a short lunar fly-by – BioSentinel will measure the DNA damage response to ambient radiation in a model organism, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which will be compared to information provided by an onboard radiation sensor and to data obtained in LEO (on ISS) and on Earth. Once in interplanetary space, fluidic cards containing desiccated yeast cells will be activated by growth medium addition at different time points throughout the mission. Growth and metabolic activity will be tracked continuously via optical density.

20210023005,PRESENTATION,Expanding Repository Data Available For Sharing and Knowledge Discovery,"[""Ryan T Scott"",""Danielle K Lopez"",""Alison J French"",""Alan E Wood"",""April Gage"",""Evelyn N Wong"",""Samrawit G Gebre"",""Sylvain V Costes""]","Some of the hardest space biology and space health challenges require data-intensive, bioinformatic, meta-analytical, and computer-assisted research approaches.  These challenges include examining interdisciplinary space life science research across experiments and across interacting spaceflight hazards (radiation, altered gravity, confinement, hostile-closed environments, distance-duration from Earth).  The approaches to confront these challenges involve mining multiple datasets simultaneously from various hierarchical organizations of biological complexity, all while concurrently evaluating how experimental design factors affect endpoints of standard assays.  To enable this field, it is essential that principal investigators (PIs) submit data in a structure so it can be maximally re-used.  

The purpose of the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) is to collect, curate, and make publicly available all non-human space-relevant biological data.  ALSDA must also ensure data are open-access, and maximally findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).  The scope of ALSDA data collected and submitted by PIs include subject and study design metadata, assay metadata parameters, raw and processed assay data, assay imagery/video, and subject-experienced mission data telemetry (radiation, temperature, humidity, acoustics, vibrations, etc.).  ALSDA recently integrated into a collaborative group of Open Science projects to facilitate a suite of new tools and workflows that will improve data submission, accessibility, and reusability by implementing digital data submission agreements, and adopting the data management system originally developed by NASA GeneLab.  ALSDA intends to bring current biological repository data and all future collected data into this new scientific data reuse reality.

This new suite of tools will enable ALSDA to deploy a science curation system using scientific assay configurations for the data submission portal.  It will capture essential assay parameters according to established standards in each sub-field within biology.  The submission portal expedites data collection by enhancing ease of PI data submission, providing a user interface and specificity for which data is to be submitted.  Data submissions can be brought into cutting-edge informatic analysis portals to enable mining of physiological, behavioral, biochemical, and imaging datasets in conjunction with ‘omics-level datasets.  As ALSDA datasets are submitted, curated, and published (e.g., micro-computed tomography, histology, pulse oximetry, serum metabolites, magnetic resonance imaging, intraocular pressure, novel object recognition, etc.), the merging together of spaceflight data along this multi-hierarchical complexity of biology will enable informatics and data-intensive approaches resulting in knowledge discoveries across missions, space hazards, and biological disciplines.

Lopez"",""Samrawit G. Gebre"",""Jonathan Galazka"",""Ahleah Rohr Daniel"",""Sylvain V. Costes""]","The next era in human space exploration is rapidly approaching and will require the use of countermeasures to deep space health hazards. The development of countermeasures (or, there-purposing of existing agents) will be highly dependent on our understanding of basic biological responses to space stressors (e.g. ionizing radiation, altered gravitational fields, altered day-night cycles, confinement, isolation, hostile-closed environments, distance-duration from Earth, exposure to celestial regolith, etc.). The fast-growing array of space  biological data, which in the past was simply archived after minimal analysis, holds great potential if it can be reorganized and formatted for Open Science. Organizing the data for such analysis is a challenge because of its diverse nature (molecular, cellular, tissue, imaging, whole organism and behavior). We will discuss here several strategies that NASA's Biological and Physical Science Division has put in place to maximize the return on investment for spaceflight bioscience data.

Open Science, as a scientific philosophy, is the concept that the more people who have access to the data, the more knowledge will be gained from it. This guiding principle led NASA to develop GeneLab in 2015. GeneLab houses spaceflight and relevant ground-based multi-omics data, and has grown to ~400 transcriptomatic, proteomic, metabolomic and epigenomic datasets from plant, rodent, small animal, and microbial space experiments. GeneLab provides users with various tools for data analysis and a visualization portal that allows users to interact with gene expression data from space-related 'omics experiments. Open Science is also about building scientific communities, and with this spirit in mind, GeneLab has spawned several Analysis Working Groups (AWGs), comprised of more than 200 volunteer scientists. The AWGs initially provided feedback on the processing pipeline and metadata 'omics standards for GeneLab. Over the last few years, they have become a community-driven science enterprise, engaging in large meta-analysis of GeneLab datasets, resulting in 10 publications (beyond the originally submitted research). Overall, the Open Science nature of GeneLab has resulted in a high degree of data-use, resulting in 40 enabled publications by open data.

The enormous success and knowledge gained from GeneLab has led to a collection of sister NASA ""Open Science Data Repositories (OSDR)"" and research support groups. These include the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA), the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC), and the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). All are adopting the GeneLab data architecture system to maximize open-access, find-ability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR). ALSDA collects and curates phenotypic-physiological bioimaging-behavioral data from space and space-relevant non-human experiments, oftentimes coming from the same omics-associated experimental datasets found in GeneLab. Since 2021, a community of ~100 researchers have rallied around ALSDA, to provide feedback in a new ALSDA AWG focused on phenotypic-physiological investigation-sample-assay metadata standards (e.g., Micro-Computed Tomography, Light/Flourescence Microscopy, Western Blot, Flow Cytometry, Novel Object Recognition, Elevated Plus Maze, etc. of ~50 assays collected). These standards are part of a new single point-of-entry data submission portal for all non-human Space Biology and Human Research Program principal investigators, to submit, curate, and share their research data.

L."",""Theriot, Corey A."",""Wu, Honglu"",""Smith, Scott M."",""Zwart, Sara R.""]","Radiation exposure and increased iron (Fe) status independently cause oxidative damage that can result in protein, lipid, and DNA oxidation. During space flight astronauts are exposed to both increased radiation and increased Fe stores. Increased body Fe results from a decrease in red blood cell mass and the typically high Fe content of the food system. In this study we investigated the combined effects of radiation exposure (0.375 Gy of Cs-137 every other day for 16 days for a total of 3 Gy) and high dietary Fe (650 mg Fe/kg diet compared to 45 mg Fe/kg for controls) in Sprague-Dawley rats (n=8/group). Liver and serum Fe were significantly increased in the high dietary Fe groups. Likewise, radiation treatment increased serum ferritin and Fe concentrations. These data indicate that total body Fe stores increase with both radiation exposure and excess dietary Fe. Hematocrit decreased in the group exposed to radiation, providing a possible mechanism for the shift in Fe indices after radiation exposure. Markers of oxidative stress were also affected by both radiation and high dietary Fe, evidenced by increased liver glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and serum catalase as well as decreased serum GPX. We thus found preliminary indications of synergistic effects of radiation exposure and increased dietary Fe, warranting further study. This study was funded by the NASA Human Research Project.","[{""submissionId"":20110022391,""id"":""bf22432ece044aaaaac5f55bf6f9fa26"",""publicationDate"":""2012-04-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110022391,""endDate"":""2012-04-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""2012 Experimental Biology Meeting"",""location"":""San Diego, CA"",""id"":""96961c3446a64bb2b517fde5889a763d"",""startDate"":""2012-04-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110022391

The primary toxic and mutagenic lesion following radiation exposure is the DNA double strand break (DSB), thus a model incorporating proteins and pathways important in response and repair of this lesion is critical. One key protein heterodimer for systems models of radiation effects is the Ku70/80 complex. The Ku70/80 complex is important in the initial binding of DSB ends following DNA damage, and is a component of nonhomologous end joining repair, the primary pathway for DSB repair in mammalian cells. The SAP domain of Ku70 (residues 556-609), contains an a helix-extended strand-helix motif and similar motifs have been found in other nucleic acid-binding proteins critical for DNA repair. However, the exact mechanism of damage recognition and substrate specificity for the Ku heterodimer remains unclear in part due to the absence of a high-resolution structure of the SAP/DNA complex. We performed a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a system with the SAP domain of Ku70 and a 10 base pairs DNA duplex. Large-scale conformational changes were observed and some putative binding modes were suggested based on energetic analysis. These modes are consistent with previous experimental investigations. In addition, the results indicate that cooperation of SAP with other domains of Ku70/80 is necessary to explain the high affinity of binding as observed in experiments.","[{""submissionId"":20070030103,""id"":""1d9b368a48294d2bb8a8713a771db895"",""publicationDate"":""2007-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20070030103,""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Lawrence, KS, United States"",""id"":""a888f42b4efb49f4afe56d34bab727c5""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20070030103,""endDate"":""2007-07-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Lawrence, KS, United States""}},""meetingId"":""c0678ba2914c4c2ca9406233ca639f52"",""id"":""4015d3369fd64cdebaa51aff712c1551""}],""name"":""13th International Congress of Radiation Research"",""location"":""San Francisco, CA"",""id"":""c0678ba2914c4c2ca9406233ca639f52"",""startDate"":""2007-07-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070030103

Crew health could be affected if the actions of medications used in spaceflight deviated from expectations formed during terrestrial medication use. Three different doses of gamma radiation (50 mGy - 6.05 Gy) and a sham were administered to groups of 6 mice each, and after various intervals of recovery time, liver gene expression was measured with RT-qPCR arrays for drug metabolism and DNA repair enzymes. Results indicated approx.65 genes of the 190 tested were significantly affected by at least one of the radiation doses. Many of the affected genes are involved in the metabolism of drugs with hydrophobic or steroid-like structures, maintenance of redox homeostasis and repair of DNA damage. Most affected genes returned to near control expression levels by 7 days post-treatment. With 6 Gy exposure, metallothionein expression was 132-fold more than control at the 4 hr time point, and fell at each later time point (11-fold at 24 hrs, and 8-fold at 7 days).

Table I contains a summary of the pertinent data from studies in which the effect is seen. [table:  see text]  This phenomenon has come to be known as the ""inverse dose rate effect,"" because it is in marked contrast to the situation at low LET, where protraction in delivery of a dose of radiation, either by fractionation or low dose rate, results in a decreased biological effect; additionally, at medium and high LET, for radiobiological end points such as clonogenic survival, the biological effectiveness is independent of protraction.  The quantity and quality of the published reports on the ""inverse dose rate effect"" leaves little doubt that the effect is real, but the available evidence indicates that the magnitude of the effect is due to a complex interplay between dose, dose rate, and radiation quality.

With the RTD Mission comes a unique opportunity to validate existing radiation transport models and guide the development of tools for shield design. For the first time, transport properties will be measured in free-space to characterize the shielding effectiveness of materials that are likely to be aboard interplanetary space missions. Target materials composed of aluminum, advanced composite spacecraft structure and other shielding materials, helium (a propellant) and tissue equivalent matrices will be evaluated. Large solid state detectors will provide kinetic energy and charge identification for incident heavy-ions and for secondary ions created in the target material.

Protection of seedlings from UV-B radiation resulted in greater leaf expansion than for UV-B-exposed seedlings, but no change in leaf or shoot dry weight occurred after 9 days of treatment.  Specific leaf weight increased in response to UV-B exposure outdoors.  Exposure of eggplant to UV-B radiation from fluorescent sunlamps in the greenhouse also decreased leaf expansion and leaf and shoot dry weight gain after 5 days of treatment.  However, there were no differences in leaf or shoot dry weight relative to control plants after 12 days of UV-B treatment, indicating that UV-B treated plants had acclimated to the treatment and actually had caught up with non-UV-B-irradiated plants in terms of growth.","[{""volume"":""22"",""submissionId"":20040090124,""issue"":""3"",""issn"":""0018-5345"",""id"":""378ac2b8a1d948849321f0f1885dfd6e"",""publicationName"":""HortScience :  a publication of the American Society for Horticultural Science"",""publicationDate"":""1987-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090124

The properties of interplanetary space are determined, to a considerable extent, by the central body of the solar system-the Sun which is the source of powerful streams of corpuscular and electromagnetic radiation, and is responsible for the structure of the interplanetary magnetic fields. Many phenomena on the Earth are closely related to processes occurring on the Sun. The mechanism of this relationship is not yet fully understood, but it is clear that the solar wind, the corpuscular streams, and short-wave electromagnetic radiation of the Sun play a prominent role in these processes.

bioinformatic, meta-analytical, and computer-assisted research approaches. These challenges include examining interdisciplinary space life science research across experiments and across interacting spaceflight hazards (radiation, altered gravity, confinement, hostile-closed environments, distance-duration from Earth). The approaches to confront these challenges involve mining multiple datasets simultaneously from various hierarchical organizations of biological complexity, all while concurrently evaluating how experimental design factors affect endpoints of standard assays. To enable this field, it is essential that principal investigators (PIs) submit data in a structure so it can be maximally re-used.
The purpose of the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) is to collect, curate, and make publicly available all non-human space-relevant biological data. ALSDA must also ensure data are open-access, and maximally findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). The scope of ALSDA data collected and submitted by PIs include subject and study design metadata, assay metadata parameters, raw and processed assay data, assay imagery/video, and subject-experienced mission data telemetry (radiation, temperature, humidity, acoustics, vibrations, etc.). ALSDA recently integrated into a collaborative group of Open Science projects to facilitate a suite of new tools and workflows that will improve data submission, accessibility, and reusability by implementing digital data submission agreements, and adopting the data management system originally developed by NASA GeneLab. ALSDA intends to bring current biological repository data and all future collected data into this new scientific data reuse reality.
 This new suite of tools will enable ALSDA to deploy a science curation system using scientific assay configurations for the data submission portal. It will capture essential assay parameters according to established standards in each sub-field within biology. The submission portal expedites data collection by enhancing ease of PI data submission, providing a user interface and specificity for which data is to be submitted. Data submissions can be brought into cutting-edge informatic analysis portals to enable mining of physiological, behavioral, biochemical, and imaging datasets in conjunction with ‘omics-level datasets. As ALSDA datasets are submitted, curated, and published (e.g., micro-computed tomography, histology, pulse oximetry, serum metabolites, magnetic resonance imaging, intraocular pressure, novel object recognition, etc.), the merging together of spaceflight data along this multi-hierarchical complexity of biology will enable informatics and data-intensive approaches resulting in knowledge discoveries across missions, space hazards, and biological disciplines.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220000503,""endDate"":""2022-02-10T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""51ac76dcd86749a99339996c86656aa6"",""id"":""984432507f54447c908e9c9af523d8cf""}],""name"":""2022 NASA Human Research Program Investigators Workshop"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""51ac76dcd86749a99339996c86656aa6"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/cd16f7a7-974e-441a-9378-8875e486b73b/summary"",""startDate"":""2022-02-07T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10448.9C.ID016GLS.13.03D"",""NNA14AB82C"",""80NSSC18M0060""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Documentation And Information Science"",""Computer Programming And Software"",""Space Sciences (General)"",""Space Radiation"",""Aerospace Medicine"",""Cybernetics, Artificial Intelligence And Robotics""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220000503

Access to space plant data enables scientists to gain a deeper understanding of biological responses to ionizing radiation, altered gravity, low atmospheric pressure, elevated CO2, and altered photoperiods. Open Science is the practice of making research available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, fostering collaborations with equity. 2023 is the ‘Year of Open Science’, and NASA has a 5-year Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission designed to rapidly transform the agency toward an inclusive culture of open science. NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) developed by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division provides access to data from space-relevant biological experiments. OSDR combines two databases, GeneLab and Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) to maximize access to standardized ‘omics (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) and phenotypic data (e.g., microscopy, biomass), respectively. OSDR started in 2014 with the creation of the first space-relevant FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) biological ‘omics repository (GeneLab), providing detailed metadata on investigation, sample, and assay levels. Today, GeneLab hosts 62 plant datasets which have led to 5 published peer-reviewed meta-analysis publications. Most of these publications were collaboration efforts under the OSDR Analysis Working Groups (AWGs). AWGs provide great opportunities for investigators to collaborate and set new standards for space-relevant data and metadata. The AWGs are welcoming any ASPB members interested in providing plant expertise for space biology. The addition of ALSDA to OSDR is also expanding analysis capability beyond ‘omics. Now is the time to get involved as a Subject Matter Expert as we establish the framework for modern plant data archiving through the AWGs.

The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR; an extension of NASA GeneLab), houses >500 studies, >1000 datasets, and is critical to the space biomedical life sciences field. OSDR has served as the foundation for ~150 peer reviewed publications, pre-prints, and student theses. This includes 19 of the 34 artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) papers worldwide in the field.

Meta-analyses, data mining, and usage of AI/ML on OSDR data has led to six main areas of discoveries and advancements: Countermeasure development, AI/ML models, radiation biology, mitochondrial impacts, environment and organism microbiomes, and plant-crops. Countermeasure research identified microRNA-targeted therapies for radiation damage, drug repurposing strategies for muscle atrophy, and an enhanced focus on CO₂ accumulation mitigation. AI/ML advances include federated learning deployed between Earth and the International Space Station, and explainable algorithms for a deeper understanding of muscle health deconditioning. Radiation studies revealed tissue-specific vulnerabilities, particularly cardiovascular FYN kinase activation and disrupted epigenetic clocks. Mitochondrial dysfunction emerged as a central hub affecting liver, muscle, and kidney tissues. Microbiome analyses documented reproducible gut community shifts and enhanced antimicrobial resistance aboard spacecraft. Plant research identified adaptive mechanisms in root development and photomorphogenesis critical for space agriculture, as well as nutritional pharmacogenomics for precision nutrition.

These discoveries were made possible by OSDR's high quality datasets, analysis-visualization tools, and the ecosystem of over 1000 volunteer Analysis Working Group members who provide feedback on OSDR’s scientific data-metadata standards and collaborate on data mining projects.

countermeasures to deep space health hazards. The development of countermeasures (or, the re-purposing of existing agents) will be highly dependent on our understanding of basic biological responses to space stressors (e.g. ionizing radiation, altered gravitational fields, altered day-night cycles, confinement, isolation, hostile-closed environments, distance-duration from Earth, exposure to celestial regolith, etc.).

20070018856,ABSTRACT,Interactions of the C-terminal Domain of Human Ku70 with DNA Substrate: A Molecular Dynamics Study,"[""Hu, Shaowen"",""Huff, Janice"",""Pluth, Janice M."",""Cucinotta, Francis A.""]","NASA is developing a systems biology approach to improve the assessment of health risks associated with space radiation. The primary toxic and mutagenic lesion following radiation exposure is the DNA double strand break (DSB), thus a model incorporating proteins and pathways important in response and repair of this lesion is critical. One key protein heterodimer for systems models of radiation effects is the Ku(sub 70/80) complex. The Ku70/80 complex is important in the initial binding of DSB ends following DNA damage, and is a component of nonhomologous end joining repair, the primary pathway for DSB repair in mammalian cells. The C-terminal domain of Ku70 (Ku70c, residues 559-609), contains an helix-extended strand-helix motif and similar motifs have been found in other nucleic acid-binding proteins critical for DNA repair. However, the exact mechanism of damage recognition and substrate specificity for the Ku heterodimer remains unclear in part due to the absence of a high-resolution structure of the Ku70c/DNA complex. We performed a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a system with the subunit Ku70c and a 14 base pairs DNA duplex, whose starting structures are designed to be variable so as to mimic their different binding modes. By analyzing conformational changes and energetic properties of the complex during MD simulations, we found that interactions are preferred at DNA ends, and within the major groove, which is consistent with previous experimental investigations. In addition, the results indicate that cooperation of Ku70c with other subunits of Ku(sub 70/80) is necessary to explain the high affinity of binding as observed in experiments.","[{""submissionId"":20070018856,""id"":""07e72dcc0dde4bd08e5842e39bcfb309"",""publicationDate"":""2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20070018856,""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Lawrence, KS, United States"",""id"":""e500d47af0b6484cbf792ebc90bbd4fd""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20070018856,""endDate"":""2007-07-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Radiation Research Society"",""location"":""Lawrence, KS, United States""}},""meetingId"":""4c9cbe2c59584ea58558933478e5fcb4"",""id"":""917852ce279342f590ae866ffaae7903""}],""name"":""International Congress of Radiation Research"",""location"":""San Francisco, CA"",""id"":""4c9cbe2c59584ea58558933478e5fcb4"",""startDate"":""2007-07-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070018856

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exponentially growing human fibroblast cells AG1522 were irradiated with gamma-rays, energetic carbon (290MeV/u), silicon (490MeV/u) and iron (200 and 600 MeV/u). Chromosomes were prematurely condensed using calyculin A. Chromatid breaks and exchanges in G2 cells were scored. PCC were collected after several post-irradiation incubation times, ranging from 5 to 600 min. RESULTS: The kinetics of chromatid break rejoining following low- or high-LET irradiation consisted of two exponential components representing a rapid and a slow time constant. Chromatid breaks decreased rapidly during the first 10min after exposure, then continued to decrease at a slower rate. The rejoining kinetics were similar for exposure to each type of radiation. Chromatid exchanges were also formed quickly. Compared to low-LET radiation, isochromatid breaks were produced more frequently and the proportion of unrejoined breaks was higher for high-LET radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with gamma-rays, isochromatid breaks were observed more frequently in high-LET irradiated samples, suggesting that an increase in isochromatid breaks is a signature of high-LET radiation exposure.","[{""volume"":""76"",""submissionId"":20040141465,""issue"":""7"",""issn"":""0955-3002"",""id"":""fe657152aa2f4dc894ae89d5edbccac2"",""publicationName"":""International journal of radiation biology"",""publicationDate"":""2000-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040141465

M."",""Bloomfield, S. A.""]","Astronauts on long duration space flight missions to the moon or mars are exposed to radiation and have increase iron (Fe) stores, both of which can independently induce oxidative stress and may exacerbate bone mass loss and strength. We hypothesize a high Fe diet and a fractionated gamma radiation exposure would increase oxidative stress and lower bone mass. Three mo-old, SD rats (n=32) were randomized to receive an adequate Fe diet (45 mg Fe/kg diet) or a high Fe diet (650 mg Fe/kg diet) for 4 wks and either a cumulative 3 Gy dose (fractionated 8 x 0.375 Gy) of gamma radiation (Cs-137) or sham exposure starting on day 14. Elisa kit assessed serum catalase, clinical analyzer assessed serum Fe status and ex vivo pQCT scans measured bone parameters in the proximal/midshaft tibia and femoral neck. Mechanical strength was assessed by 3-pt bending and femoral neck test. There is a significant decrease in trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) from radiation (p less than 0.05) and a trend in diet (p=0.05) at the proximal tibia. There is a significant interaction in cortical BMD from the combined treatments at the midshaft tibia (p less than 0.05). There is a trending decrease in total BMD from diet (p=0.07) at the femoral neck. In addition, high serum Fe was correlated to low trabecular BMD (p less than 0.05) and high serum catalase was correlated to low BMD at all 3 bone sites (p less than 0.05). There was no difference in the max load of the tibia or femoral neck. Radiation and a high iron diet increases iron status and catalase in the serum and decreases BMD.","[{""submissionId"":20110023082,""id"":""b9cf65b20f13435789fcf1063533d7fa"",""publicationDate"":""2012-04-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110023082,""endDate"":""2012-04-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Experimental Biology 2012 (EB2012)"",""location"":""San Diego, CA"",""id"":""00ca457c80f7499791271aa39a93d43d"",""startDate"":""2012-04-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110023082
20190025437,PRESENTATION,Variability in Galactic Cosmic Radiation- Induced DNA Damage Response in Inbred Mice Is Modulated by Genetics,"[""Costes, Sylvain V."",""Ray, Shayoni"",""Staatz, Kevin"",""Snijders, Antoine M."",""Pluth, Janice M.""]","In radiation biology, the ability to predict cancer risk associated with exposure to low doses of high-LET (Linear Energy Transfer) ionizing radiation remains a challenge. Epidemiological methods lack the sensitivity and power to provide detailed risk estimates for cancer and ignore individual sensitivity. We have hypothesized that DNA repair capacity is the primary factor differentiating peoples radiation sensitivity. We previously showed in immortalized human cell lines that characterizing the dose and time dependence of p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) foci formation in the nucleus following X-rays exposure is sufficient to predict DNA repair response to any other LET in the same cell line. We now tested this hypothesis across a population of mice with different genetic background. Fibroblast cells were extracted and cultivated from 76 individual mice from 15 different strains and exposed to HZE (high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) galactic cosmic ray particles) particles and X-rays. Individual radiation sensitivities were investigated by high throughput measurement of DNA repair kinetics that evaluated 53bp1 foci numbers as a surrogate for DNA double-strand breaks at various times post-irradiation. Instead of just counting foci which can be hard to distinguish for high-LET or high doses, we also took into account the track structure of high-LET particles to compute the remaining number of unrepaired tracks as a function of time post-irradiation. As expected, the percentage of unrepaired track over a 48 hours follow-up period increased with LET. In addition, repair rate was modulated by genetics, with animals from the same strain showing small variance while large rate differences were observed between strains. Radiation strain sensitivity ranking was estimated based on repair rates from exposure to each LET evaluated in this work, and ranking for high-LET correlated better with ranking from high dose of X-ray, not low dose. At the in-vivo level, drops in T-cells and B-cells number measured 24 hours after 0.1 Gy (Gray) X-ray exposure, correlated with slower DNA repair kinetic in fibroblast cells of the same strains of mice. At the genomic level, mouse genome wide association (GWA) analysis identified seven significant genetic loci on chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 13 and 19 with different significance depending on the LET. Interestingly, for the two highest LET, a common locus on Chromosome 10 was identified with high enrichment for DNA repair associated genes.Overall, this work suggests that repair kinetics of primary skin fibroblasts is a good surrogate marker for in-vivo radiation sensitivities in other tissues and that this response is modulated by genetics. Our study also confirms that DNA repair kinetics following high doses of X-ray can be used to predict radiation sensitivity to high-LET.","[{""submissionId"":20190025437,""id"":""c216dac3dd45439fb1e1b611817b6751"",""publicationDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190025437,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""a2c05281719b47cd88c2835844e2dbc2""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190025437,""endDate"":""2018-01-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""8a74bd5d3a1f42288f3c05b4466b35dd"",""id"":""e19f793a9f73468e884a26b3acd26bb7""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigatorsý Workshop (HRP IWS 2018)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""8a74bd5d3a1f42288f3c05b4466b35dd"",""startDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190025437

Additionally, we have observed that both the radiation environment and the temperature of the spring waters vary over time. Because localized “hot spots” of elevated radiation and biofilms are easily accessible, various biological studies of radiation resistance and biosignature formation are possible, making this field site relevant for analog field studies that consider microbiology, geochemistry, and ionizing radiation.

NASA’s Artemis missions seek to build technologies that enable extended crewed flights into deep space, a region not travelled by humans for over 50 years. From the Apollo missions and ground experiments, it is known that BLEO galactic cosmic radiation can cause damage to DNA and proteins, as well as an increased risk of cancer to astronauts.

NASA’s latest biosensor technology, the Lunar Explorer Instrument for space biology applications (LEIA), builds upon the viable and cost-effective platform of CubeSats to take biology experiments back to the Moon. Stationed on the lunar South Pole, LEIA will collect valuable in-situ radiation data, and use yeast to study the response to combined partial gravity and radiation stressors, as well as provide a proof-of-concept of on-demand bio nutrient production as a countermeasure for future crewed missions.

Directly enhancing the abilities of the BioSentinel CubeSat mission, the main components of LEIA are the two radiation sensors and the 4U BioSensor, composed of 16-microfluidic cards housing dried yeast cells. The payload is fully contained and autonomous, directly sending data back to Earth without the need for sample return. In addition, the thermal environment of the BioSensor is optimized to keep cells alive for the pre-launch period and duration of the Artemis III mission, while also running on limited power supply.

This talk highlights how the development of flexible instruments, like LEIA, enables human exploration into deep space. The technology developed with LEIA can be used as a stepping-stone for establishing a sustained lunar surface habitation and beyond, as humans continue to venture into space.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230011094,""endDate"":""2023-11-18T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""5168e4271f034bf1859ab004f3c5b14c"",""id"":""aeae5d20c2534bd7a757855404bc0a84""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) "",""location"":""Washington, D.C."",""id"":""5168e4271f034bf1859ab004f3c5b14c"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/2023-meeting/"",""startDate"":""2023-11-14T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""533001.07.02.01.02.01""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230011094

It is shown that, whereas for protons and Galactic cosmic rays the ordering of shield materials has a negligible effect, for electrons and secondary bremsstrahlung, both the order and the composition are important parameters. It was found that low-atomic-number materials are most effective shields against protons and galactic cosmic rays, and are most effective in decreasing bremsstrahlung production, while high-atomic-number shields are the best attenuators of both primary electrons (if the dose is dominated by primary electrons) and secondary bremsstrahlung (if this is produced).","[{""submissionId"":19890066860,""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""1e6c1ec227e448c6a180acf602fecffa"",""publicationName"":""- Radiation Biology, Espoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research"",""publicationDate"":""1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19890066860

Initial studies of space travel have focused primarily on the short-term effects of radiation and microgravity on adult organisms. However, with the potential for increased lengths of time in space, it is critical to now address the effects of space on all phases of an organism's life cycle, from embryogenesis to post-natal development to reproduction. It is already possible for certain species to undergo multiple generations within the confines of the Mir Space Station. The possibility now exists for scientists to consider the consequences of even potentially subtle defects in development through multiple phases of an organism's life cycle, or even through multiple generations. In this discussion, we highlight a few of the salient observations on the effects of the space environment on vertebrate development and reproductive function.

20240010744,POSTER,The BioSensor Instrument Beyond LEIA: a Versatile Platform for Lunar Biology,"[""J A Lee"",""M R Padgen"",""A J Ricco"",""L R Timucin"",""M P Lera"",""S Gilroy"",""S R Santa Maria"",""A M Settles""]","Introduction:  The BioSensor is a deep-space-compatible automated microfluidic culturing instrument. While originally designed to measure the effects of deep space radiation on yeast growth for the BioSentinel mission, it has the potential to host a diverse range of life science experiments with single- and/or multi-celled organisms and can be adapted to interface with a diverse range of platforms in both crewed and uncrewed settings.  It is therefore a leading candidate for hosting life sciences experimentation associated with a lunar surface habitat.

BioSensor design:  The function of the BioSensor is to monitor the growth and metabolic activity of samples in batch fluidic culture, without the need for crew involvement. The current configuration houses organisms in 16 wells within 16 microfluidic cards, accommodating a total of 256 samples, replicates, and controls. Each well has an optical system including three LEDs and a photodiode detector to measure absorbance at three wavelengths, enabling measurement of optical density, color change in dyes such as alamarBlue, and bioproduction of pigmented compounds. Organisms are loaded into fluidic wells and air-dried for storage during integration, launch, and transit, then activated by the introduction of culture medium from storage bags via manifolds that fill one card at a time. Temperature is controlled by individual card heaters, and timing of all activities (fluidics fills, optical measurements, temperatures) is directed by an experiment script. The self-contained BioSensor payload is roughly 4U in volume; with electrical/mechanical/thermal interface, e.g. for operation on ISS or a lunar lander, as well as a  linear energy-transfer (LET) charged-particle radiation spectrometer, the entire system is closer to 6U.

BioSentinel and LEIA:  Flown on the ISS and in a deep-space free flyer for BioSentinel, the BioSensor has been modified for use in the LEIA mission, including improvements to reduce the sensitivity to lengthy launch delays. LEIA will monitor yeast growth in the radiation and reduced-gravity environment of the lunar surface no earlier than 2026, on a CLPS lander [4]. Changes include accommodating additional culture media and an additional LED color for a new biological assay (bioproduction of carotenoids-- dietary antioxidants), as well as modifications to the housing to allow late-load biology changeout and improved isolation between fluidics and electronics. 

Future prospects: Future work with the BioSensor, beyond LEIA, will include expanding the range and diversity of organisms and assays accommodated. Preliminary work has demonstrated the growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in BioSensor fluidic cards, including optical measurements of growth rate over time. Minor modifications could allow measurement of phenotypes related to photosynthetic capacity in both plants and cyanobacteria. The experimental capabilities of the BioSensor could be dramatically increased by introducing the capability for fluorescence measurements, and/or the design of novel biological assays using luminescence. The BioSensor can also be adapted for new platforms and experiment settings; in addition to free-flyer, ISS, and CLPS lander, a preliminary design concept has been developed for crewed deployment directly to the lunar surface. The instrument could be accommodated inside a lunar habitat, where its automated operation would make it an excellent candidate for experiments from fundamental investigations into the response of organisms to lunar surface conditions to applied-science purposes such as screening engineered strains of various organisms for bioproduction capability.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240010744,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""caba028024835183ac5ceb068aa86384"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Lunar and Planetary Institute"",""location"":""Houston, Texas, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d5b14d1079bc4766b96e10d169efee2c"",""id"":""fcba3acce9684315be36e0cb5fad7cae""}],""name"":""Lunar Surface Science Workshop Virtual Session 24"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""d5b14d1079bc4766b96e10d169efee2c"",""url"":""https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lunarsurface2020/#nav"",""startDate"":""2024-08-20T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""207022.05.02.01.04.01""]",undefined,"[""Lunar and Planetary Science and Exploration""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240010744

Thus materials brought from earth must be light, stable and reliable at destination. Using traditional approaches a lunar or Mars base would require either transporting a hefty store of metals or heavy manufacturing equipment and construction materials for in situ extraction; both would severely limit any other mission objectives. Long-term human space presence requires periodic replenishment, adding a massive cost overhead. Even robotic missions often sacrifice science goals for heavy radiation and thermal protection. Biology has the potential to solve these problems because it can replicate and repair itself, and do a wide variety of chemical reactions including making food, fuel and materials. Synthetic biology enhances and expands life's evolved repertoire. Using organisms as feedstock, additive manufacturing could make possible the dream of producing bespoke tools, food, smart fabrics and even replacement organs on demand.

T."",""Globus, R. K.""]","Ionizing radiation-induced bone loss appears to be a two-stage process: first an early increase in pro-resorption cytokines and increased bone resorption by osteoclasts, followed by a decrease in bone formation by osteoblasts. This results in a net loss of mass in mineralized bone tissue. The molecular mechanisms underlying the imbalance in bone remodeling caused by exposure to radiation are not fully understood. We hypothesized that the radiation-induced rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) damages osteoblast progenitors, leading to a decrease in number and activity of differentiated progeny. We have shown that a diet high in antioxidant capacity prevents radiation-induced bone loss in adult mice (Schreurs et al. 2016) by reducing the early increase in pro-resotption cytokines. Here, we investigated the damaging effects of radiation exposure on cells in the osteoblast lineage, testing if addition of the exogenous antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD) can mitigate radiation damage. Osteoprogenitors were grown in vitro from the marrow of 16-week-old, male C57Bl6 mice. Cells were irradiated 3 days after plating (day 0) with either gamma (137Cs, 0.1-5Gy) or iron (56Fe, 600 MeVn, 0.5-2Gy), and then grown until day 10. SOD or vehicle was added 2 hours before irradiation (SOD at 200Uml), twice a day and up to day 5, for a total of 2 days treatment. Cell behavior was assessed by: (a) colony number (counted on day 7), (b) DNA content (surrogate for cell number) to assess cell growth (percent change between day 3 and day 10) and (c) alkaline phosphatase activity (osteoblast differentiation marker). Results show that SOD protected cells from the adverse effects of low-LET(Linear Energy Transfer) ionizing radiation, but not high-LET radiation. These novel results provide an interesting platform to explore further diverse effects and damages caused by low-LET and high-LET, pointing toward different mechanisms and possible intervention strategies for radiation-induced bone loss.","[{""submissionId"":20180008604,""id"":""41474cb8343143af809eb10827dfcaf2"",""publicationDate"":""2016-12-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20180008604,""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States"",""id"":""c9c326a5b0bf435b914215e49dae6ed1""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180008604,""endDate"":""2016-12-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""90646d581ec14c7482f07e51fd989a5c"",""id"":""3f8e5c843ba445f2b5f7f66aa26967e7""}],""name"":""Cell Biology 2016 ASCB Annual Meeting"",""location"":""San Francisco, CA"",""id"":""90646d581ec14c7482f07e51fd989a5c"",""startDate"":""2016-12-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C"",""NCC9ý58"",""NSBRI-MA02501"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180008604

From Earth, BioSensor will transport desiccated yeast within 16 fluidic cards, each containing 16 fluidic wells of 100 microliters volume. At the start of the experiment, these microbes will be autonomously rehydrated on the Moon, and optical absorbance measurements at three wavelengths will be performed across all 256 wells. 

Absorbance measurements in fluidic wells are susceptible to noise and artifacts due to bubble formation during well rehydration and microbial growth. BioSensor, as a biofluidics system, faces significant data anomalies caused by payload vibrations, particularly from the operation of the co-located PROSPECT’s ProSEED drill, to assess lunar resources by penetrating the subsurface. 

To evaluate the impact of drill vibrations, fully assembled and filled fluidic cards were subjected to sine sweep signals in the x, y, z planes, ranging from 5 - 2560 Hz at g-loads of 0.25 and 0.5, with on-board accelerometer for localized vibration measurement. Wells with various fill conditions, including partial fills with different bubble sizes and completely filled wells, were tested.  

Results indicated that small bubbles adhered to well walls at high frequencies but were dislodged at low frequencies, causing data anomalies. Medium and large bubbles exhibited higher interference with optical data due to lower surface tension and variable bubble surface flexion. Overall, it was found that irrespective of the fill type, low-frequency vibrations were most detrimental to optical readings. 

Understanding the drill schedule and correlating it with BioSensor timestamps will help identify periods when BioSensor data is unreliable, a crucial step for accurately interpreting the microbial response data and ensuring the validity of the BioSensor's scientific measurements on the lunar surface.

20180001327,PRESENTATION,Ballooning for Biologists: Mission Essentials for Flying Experiments on Large NASA Balloons,"[""Smith, David J."",""Sowa, Marianne""]","Despite centuries of scientific balloon flights, only a handful of experiments have produced biologically-relevant results. Yet unlike orbital spaceflight, it is much faster and cheaper to conduct biology research with balloons, sending specimens to the near space environment of Earths stratosphere. Samples can be loaded the morning of a launch and sometimes returned to the laboratory within one day after flying. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) flies large, unmanned scientific balloons from all over the globe, with missions ranging from hours to weeks in duration. A payload in the middle portion of the stratosphere (approx. 35 km above sea level) will be exposed to an environment similar to the surface of Mars: temperatures generally around -36 C, atmospheric pressure at a thin 1 kPa, relative humidity levels <1%, and a harsh illumination of ultraviolet (UV) and cosmic radiation levels (about 100 W/sq m and 0.1 mGy/d, respectively) that can be obtained nowhere else on the surface of the Earth, including environmental chambers and particle accelerator facilities attempting to simulate space radiation effects. Considering the operational advantages of ballooning and the fidelity of space-like stressors in the stratosphere, researchers in aerobiology, astrobiology, and space biology can benefit from balloon flight experiments as an intermediary step on the extraterrestrial continuum (ground, low Earth orbit, and deep space studies). Our presentation targets biologists with no background or experience in scientific ballooning. We will provide an overview of large balloon operations, biology topics that can be uniquely addressed in the stratosphere, and a roadmap for developing payloads to fly with NASA.","[{""submissionId"":20180001327,""id"":""aaac82e04d09424787010be6c0546542"",""publicationDate"":""2017-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20180001327,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States"",""id"":""c0edd29a645a43eda7562095d4592e55""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180001327,""endDate"":""2017-10-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""c67d6730fff44ef0ba0b8e904ce901ad"",""id"":""21a55d9657a541e89c4980cbf54cef93""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR 2017)"",""location"":""Seattle, WA"",""id"":""c67d6730fff44ef0ba0b8e904ce901ad"",""startDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180001327
20170000004,ABSTRACT,Superoxide Dismutase Protects Osteoprogenitors from Irradiation with Low-LET but Not High-LET Species,"[""Schreurs, A.-S."",""Tran, L."",""Alwood, J. S."",""Tahimic, C. G."",""Globus, R. K.""]","Ionizing radiation-induced bone loss appears to be a two-stage process: first an early increase in pro-resorption cytokines and increased bone resorption by osteoclasts, followed by a decrease in bone formation by osteoblasts. This results in a net loss of mass in mineralized bone tissue. The molecular mechanisms underlying the imbalance in bone remodeling caused by exposure to radiation are not fully understood. We hypothesized that the radiation-induced rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) damages osteoblast progenitors, leading to a decrease in number and activity of differentiated progeny. We have shown that a diet high in antioxidant capacity prevents radiation-induced bone loss in adult mice (Schreurs et al. 2016) by reducing the early increase in pro-resotption cytokines. Here, we investigated the damaging effects of radiation exposure on cells in the osteoblast lineage, testing if addition of the exogenous antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD) can mitigate radiation damage. Osteoprogenitors were grown in vitro from the marrow of 16wk old, male C57Bl/6 mice. Cells were irradiated 3 days after plating (day 0) with either gamma (Cs-137, 0.1-5Gy) or iron (Fe-56, 600 MeV/n, 0.5-2Gy), and then grown until day 10. SOD or vehicle was added 2 hours before irradiation (SOD at 200U/ml), twice a day and up to day 5, for a total of 2 days treatment. Cell behavior was assessed by: (a) colony number (counted on day 7), (b) DNA content (surrogate for cell number) to assess cell growth (percent change between day 3 and day 10) and (c) alkaline phosphatase activity (osteoblast differentiation marker). Results show that SOD protected cells from the adverse effects of low-LET ionizing radiation, but not high-LET radiation. These novel results provide an interesting platform to explore further diverse effects and damages caused by low-LET and high-LET, pointing toward different mechanisms and possible intervention strategies for radiation-induced bone loss.","[{""submissionId"":20170000004,""id"":""09cf532322634a8c9ce86649e5889b71"",""publicationDate"":""2016-12-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20170000004,""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States"",""id"":""0aaf88a6113347998051e2e6713131e3""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170000004,""endDate"":""2016-12-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""437a47b4a72d47749ce929f45a333d31"",""id"":""a6d91c3dbe8d440dbc6cbb686ceea9b0""}],""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) Meeting 2016"",""location"":""San Francisco, CA"",""id"":""437a47b4a72d47749ce929f45a333d31"",""startDate"":""2016-12-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNH15CO48B"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170000004
20170002275,ABSTRACT,3D Printing of Advanced Biocomposites on Earth and Beyond,"[""Rothschild, Lynn J."",""Gentry, Diana "",""Micks, Ashley""]","Human exploration off planet is severely limited by the cost of launching materials into space and re-supply. Thus materials brought from earth must be light, stable and reliable at destination. Using traditional approaches a lunar or Mars base would require either transporting a hefty store of metals or heavy manufacturing equipment and construction materials for in situ extraction; both would severely limit any other mission objectives. Long-term human space presence requires periodic replenishment, adding a massive cost overhead. Even robotic missions often sacrifice science goals for heavy radiation and thermal protection. Biology has the potential to solve these problems because it can replicate and repair itself, and do a wide variety of chemical reactions including making food, fuel and materials. Synthetic biology can greatly enhance and expand life's evolved repertoire. Using natural and synthetically altered organisms as the feedstock for additive manufacturing could one day make possible the dream of producing bespoke tools, food, smart fabrics and even replacement organs on demand. To this end our lab has produced a proof-of-concept bioprinter with nearly one-cell resolution. Genetically engineering yeast cells to secrete bioproducts subsequent to printing allows the potential to make biomaterials with a fine microstructure. Imagine a production system that, at a few micron scale resolution, can add mollusk shell for compressive strength per unit mass, spider silk or collagen for tensile strength per unit mass, and potentially biologically-deposited wires. Now imagine what new products can be enabled by such a technology, on earth or beyond.","[{""submissionId"":20170002275,""id"":""6292b74f20624f49a002ac72505102cf"",""publicationDate"":""2014-10-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170002275,""endDate"":""2014-10-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Inside 3D Printing Conference"",""location"":""Santa Clara, CA"",""id"":""c3420617f86744908f45a1e3db82476b"",""startDate"":""2014-10-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNX14AF94A""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170002275

The Materials Science Program is one of five Microgravity Research disciplines within this new Enterprise's Division of Physical Sciences Research. The Materials Science Program will participate within this new enterprise structure in order to facilitate effective use of ISS facilities, target scientific and technology questions and transfer results for Earth benefits. The Materials Science research will use a low gravity environment for flight and ground-based research in crystallization, fundamental processing, properties characterization, and biomaterials in order to obtain fundamental understanding of various phenomena effects and relationships to the structures, processing, and properties of materials. Completion of the International Space Station's (ISS) first major assembly, during the past year, provides new opportunities for on-orbit research and scientific utilization. The Enterprise has recently completed an assessment of the science prioritization from which the future materials science ISS type payloads will be implemented. Science accommodations will support a variety of Materials Science payload hardware both in the US and international partner modules with emphasis on early use of Express Rack and Glovebox facilities. This paper addresses the current scope of the flight and ground investigator program. These investigators will use the various capabilities of the ISS lab facilities to achieve their research objectives. The type of research and classification of materials being studied will be addressed. This includes the recent emphasis being placed on radiation shielding, nanomaterials, propulsion materials, and biomaterials type research. The Materials Science Program will pursue a new, interdisciplinary approach, which contributes, to Human Space Flight Exploration research. The Materials Science Research Facility (MSRF) and other related American and International experiment modules will serve as the foundation for the flight research environment. A summary will explain the concept for materials science research processing capabilities aboard the ISS along with the various ground facilities necessary to support the program.","[{""submissionId"":20030000982,""id"":""c6f75068e7df4015b9314ea777c71dbf"",""publicationDate"":""2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20030000982,""endDate"":""2002-10-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""World Space Congress and ISS Utilization Conference"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""341c95c8b2ce4400bdf5a58cf222a209"",""startDate"":""2002-10-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Astronautics (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20030000982

Because exposure to heavy particles can cause oxidative stress, it is possible that antioxidants can be used to mitigate these risks (and possibly some health risks of microgravity). To assess the capacity of antioxidant diets to mitigate the effects of exposure to heavy particles, rats were maintained on antioxidant diets containing 2% blueberry or strawberry extract or a control diet for 8 weeks prior to exposure to 1.5 or 2.0 Gy of accelerated iron particles at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Following irradiation rats were tested on a series of behavioral tasks: amphetamine-induced taste aversion learning, operant responding and spatial learning and memory. The results indicated that the performance of the irradiated rats maintained on the antioxidant diets was, in general, significantly better than that of the control animals, although the effectiveness of the diets ameliorating the radiation-induced deterioration in performance varied as a function of both the specific diet and the specific endpoint. In addition, animals fed antioxidant diets prior to exposure showed reduced heavy particle-induced tumorigenesis one year after exposure compared to the animals fed the control diet. These results suggest that antioxidant diets have the potential to serve as part of a system designed to provide protection to astronauts against the effects of heavy particles on exploratory missions outside the magnetic field of the earth.","[{""volume"":""18"",""submissionId"":20050232136,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""1089-988X"",""id"":""8359837d656440d5af1bb01d65682d6d"",""publicationName"":""Gravitational and space biology bulletin :  publication of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""publicationDate"":""2005-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG1-529"",""NAG9-1190""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050232136

In both the human and mice work, we have hypothesized that DNA repair capacity can be used as a marker to evaluate and differentiate individual radiation sensitivity. More specifically, this work is based on the concept that the combined time-dose dependence of radiation-induced foci (RIF) of p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) following low-LET exposure contains sufficient information to infer sensitivity to any other LET. This work is one of the most extensive studies on the kinetics and possible genetic underpinnings of radiation-induced DNA damage and repair. Results on humans are still preliminary as we are still in the process of collecting and isolating primary blood mononuclear cells from 500 to 800 healthy subjects of European descent, 18-75 years of age, 50/50 male/female distribution. We have analyzed 53BP1+ RIF formation as well as oxidative stress and cell death in primary cells from 192 subjects in response to the same HZE particles as used in mice: 600 MeV/n Fe, 350 MeV/n Ar and 350 MeV/n Si, 1.1 and 3 particles/100m2, 4 and 24 hours after irradiation.

NASA GeneLab is an open-access repository for omics datasets generated by biological experiments conducted in space or experiments relevant to spaceflight (e.g. simulated cosmic radiation, simulated microgravity, bed rest studies). Started as a repository designed to archive precious omics from space experiments, GeneLab has expanded its scope to maximize the intelligibility of the raw data (e.g. RNAseq, microarray, WGBS, metagenome), particularly for users with limited bioinformatics knowledge. As such GeneLab is now providing processed data derived from the raw data covering a large spectrum of omics (genome, epigenome, transcriptome, epitranscriptome, proteome, metabolome), to help users explore important questions: Which genes or proteins are expressed differently in space for various living organisms? What are the consequences arising from these changes? What specifics DNA mutations or epigenetic changes happen in space? What species or genetic features lead to better adaption to such a unique environment? In this presentation, we will report on the current and future objectives for GeneLab, and review recent published studies relating molecular changes observed in various animal models and tissue with microgravity, radiation, circadian rhythm, hydration and carbon dioxide conditions.","[{""submissionId"":20190027262,""id"":""e504bf6f9ee34c1880d16a3daf6dc89f"",""publicationDate"":""2019-02-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Exobiology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190027262

C."",""Wang, Y."",""Iliakis, G.""]","Manipulation of checkpoint response to DNA damage can be developed as a means for protecting astronauts from the adverse effects of unexpected, or background exposures to ionizing radiation. To achieve this goal reagents need to be developed that protect cells from radiation injury by prolonging checkpoint response, thus promoting repair. We present evidence for a low molecular weight substance excreted by cells that dramatically increases the duration of the G2-delay. This compound is termed G2-Arrest Modulating Activity (GAMA). A rat cell line (A1-5) generated by transforming rat embryo fibroblasts with a temperature sensitive form of p53 plus H-ras demonstrates a dramatic increase in radiation resistance after exposure to low LET radiation that is not associated with an increase in the efficiency of rejoining of DNA double strand breaks. Radioresistance in this cell line correlates with a dramatic increase in the duration of the G2 arrest that is modulated by a GAMA produced by actively growing cells. The properties of GAMA suggest that it is a low molecular weight heat-stable peptide. Further characterization of this substance and elucidation of its mechanism of action may allow the development of a biological response modifier with potential applications as a radioprotector. GAMA may be useful for protecting astronauts from radiation injury as preliminary evidence suggests that it is able to modulate the response of cells exposed to heavy ion radiation, similar to that encountered in outer space.","[{""volume"":""17 Suppl 1"",""submissionId"":20040088538,""issn"":""1120-1797"",""id"":""6232f8d6ebbd46feada9a0c3861e3744"",""publicationName"":""Physica medica :  PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088538

Lopez"",""Samrawit G. Gebre"",""Ahleah Rohr Daniel"",""Sylvain V. Costes""]","The next era in human space exploration is rapidly approaching and will require the use of countermeasures to deep space health hazards. The development of countermeasures (or, the re-purposing of existing agents) will be highly dependent on our understanding of basic biological responses to space stressors (e.g. ionizing radiation, altered gravitational fields, altered day-night cycles, confinement, isolation, hostile-closed environments, distance-duration from Earth, exposure to celestial regolith, etc.). The fast-growing array of space biological data, which in the past was simply archived after minimal analysis, holds great potential if it can be reorganized and formatted for Open Science. Organizing the data for such analysis is a challenge because of its diverse nature (molecular, cellular, tissue, imaging, whole organism and behavior).  We will discuss here several strategies that NASA’s Biological and Physical Science Division has put in place to maximize the return on investment for spaceflight bioscience data. 

Open Science, as a scientific philosophy, is the concept that the more people who have access to the data, the more knowledge will be gained from it. This guiding principle led NASA to develop GeneLab in 2015. GeneLab houses spaceflight and relevant ground-based multi-omics data, and has grown to ~400 transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and epigenomic datasets from plant, rodent, small animal, and microbial space experiments. GeneLab provides users with various tools for data analysis and a visualization portal that allows users to interact with gene expression data from space-related ‘omics experiments. Open Science is also about building scientific communities, and with this spirit in mind, GeneLab has spawned several Analysis Working Groups (AWGs), comprised of more than 200 volunteer scientists. The AWGs initially provided feedback on the processing pipeline and metadata ‘omics standards for GeneLab. Over the last few years, they have become a community-driven science enterprise, engaging in large meta-analysis of GeneLab datasets, resulting in 10 publications (beyond the originally submitted research). Overall, the Open Science nature of  GeneLab has resulted in a high degree of data re-use, resulting in 38 additional publications derived from the original 67 publication over the past four years.

The enormous success and knowledge gained from GeneLab has led to a collection of sister NASA “Open Science Data Repositories (OSDR)” and research support groups. These include the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA), the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC), and the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). All are adopting the GeneLab data architecture system to maximize open-access, find-ability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR). ALSDA collects and curates phenotypic-physiological bioimaging-behavioral data from space and space-relevant non-human experiments, oftentimes coming from the same omics-associated experimental datasets found in GeneLab. Since 2021, a community of ~100 researchers have rallied around ALSDA, to provide feedback in a new ALSDA AWG focused on phenotypic-physiological investigation-sample-assay metadata standards (e.g., Micro-Computed Tomography, Light/Fluorescence Microscopy, Western Blot, Flow Cytometry, Novel Object Recognition, Elevated Plus Maze, etc. of ~50 assays collected). These standards are part of a new single point-of-entry data submission portal for all non-human Space Biology and Human Research Program principal investigators, to submit, curate, and share their research data. 

With open-access space biological data now collected and curated together with rich metadata, and with the potential for linkage to “big data” from the international biological and medical communities (NIH, EBI, etc.), the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) era has started for Space Biology.  Several other talks will cover these topics in this conference.",[],"[{""country"":""GR"",""submissionId"":20220002697,""endDate"":""2022-07-24T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""1e7f17b3e6cd4b94a8c57224d99e8901"",""id"":""64f294e75c854d39b08c4e9ff1db968e""}],""name"":""COSPAR 2022 - 44th Scientific Assembly"",""location"":""Athens"",""id"":""1e7f17b3e6cd4b94a8c57224d99e8901"",""url"":""https://www.cosparathens2022.org/"",""startDate"":""2022-07-16T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10448.9C.ID016GLS.13.03D""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Documentation And Information Science""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220002697

C.""]","PURPOSE: To develop a biophysical model that explains the sizes of radiation-induced hprt deletions. METHODS: Key assumptions: (1) Deletions are produced by two DSB that are closer than an interaction distance at the time of DSB induction; (2) Interphase chromatin is modelled by a biphasic random walk distribution; and (3) Misrejoining of DSB from two separate tracks dominates at low-LET and misrejoining of DSB from a single track dominates at high-LET. RESULTS: The size spectra for radiation-induced total deletions of the hprt gene are calculated. Comparing with the results of Yamada and coworkers for gamma-irradiated human fibroblasts the study finds that an interaction distance of 0.75 microm will fit both the absolute frequency and the size spectrum of the total deletions. It is also shown that high-LET radiations produce, relatively, more total deletions of sizes below 0.5 Mb. The model predicts an essential gene to be located between 2 and 3 Mb from the hprt locus towards the centromere. Using the same assumptions and parameters as for evaluating mutation frequencies, a frequency of intra-arm chromosome deletions is calculated that is in agreement with experimental data. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced total-deletion mutations of the human hprt gene and intrachange chromosome aberrations share a common mechanism for their induction.","[{""volume"":""73"",""submissionId"":20040172766,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0955-3002"",""id"":""c3f988d6b23a4fd89e994328beaf08b9"",""publicationName"":""International journal of radiation biology"",""publicationDate"":""1998-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040172766

Transfer of viable organisms is a function of parameters such as ejection shock, radiation exposure, and others, applied across four phases in the transfer process: ejection from the parent body, transport through interplanetary space, infall onto the target world, and biological adaptation. If terrestrial biota could survive transport to Europa, then biology on Europa may be either the product of a separate and unrelated origin or they are the descendants of transferred terrestrial organisms. If, however, transfer of viable organisms is impossible, then any biota present on Europa must be the product of a biological origin independent from terrestrial life. We will investigate the survival likelihood of material falling onto Europa.

20205011447,PRESENTATION,A Lunar Ground Truth of Microbes that are Integral to Sustaining Biological Life Support Systems,"[""Aubrie O'Rourke""]","A lunar outpost such as Gateway or a Mars transit vehicle will use a semi-closed to closed loop biological life support system (BLSS) adapted for microgravity and high levels of radiation. A moon habitat will likely exist under partial gravity conditions and sustained levels of high radiation as a semi-closed loop system able to get resources from Earth via Gateway. Additionally, the moon will act as a closed-loop testbed for Mars habitat operations and will employ various elements of in situ resource utilization (ISRU). Perhaps the longest running BLSS collective study to date is that of the European MELiSSA (Micro Ecological Life Support System Alternative) project, a circular life support system, established to gain knowledge on regenerative systems aimed at the highest degree of autonomy to produce food, water and oxygen from mission wastes. This setup has evaluated the use of discrete microbial compartments and a higher plant compartment to carry out the necessary life support functions to support crew. Such compartments utilize thermophilic anaerobes to break down human and inedible plant wastes,  photoheterotrophic bacteria that can further metabolize volatile fatty acids, nitrifying bacteria that can convert ammonium to plant and microalgae available nitrates, and photoautotrophic bacteria and higher plants which will convert carbon dioxide to oxygen, purify water, and provide food for human consumption. This being the most advanced BLSS model example to date -aside from the Yuegong-1, Chinese Lunar Palace- with the most defined compartment composition, and the assumption that other BLSSs will build upon such models, it becomes relevant to study the effects of the lunar environment upon the microbes that are integral to a BLSS.  In ramping up to advanced stage BLSS systems, relatively simple experiments can be conducted on Artemis missions using continuous culturing and sampling of the model microbes, subsequently subjected to DNA sequencing for mutational analysis monitoring and chemical analysis to assess the sustained ability to carry out their hallmark biochemical processes efficiently. A suite of microbes should be assessed, prioritizing those with the duel capacity to be utilized in an BLSS and the ability to biochemically facilitate ISRU goals, such as the ability to transform the biogeochemistry of Moon or Martian regolith into materials that can support crop growth or extract elements of industrial significance such as aluminum or iron.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20205011447,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""5c929cce29b0585fb37efe77c6e9d156"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Kennedy Space Center"",""location"":""Merritt Island, Florida, United States""}},""meetingId"":""36049e61949d448ab4219555ce85182d"",""id"":""256f5092cd2e431aa8fc1258bfd036d3""}],""name"":""Lunar Surface Science Workshop (LSSW) Space Biology virtual session 7"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""36049e61949d448ab4219555ce85182d"",""startDate"":""2020-12-15T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.01.02.08.01""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205011447

GeneLab does so by providing fully coordinated epigenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data (collectively known as omics data) alongside essential metadata describing each spaceflight and space-relevant experiment. The open-access GeneLab repository currently consists of over 300 omics datasets generated by biological experiments, involving various model organisms, that are relevant to spaceflight. In order to maximize the intelligibility of these data, particularly for users with limited bioinformatics knowledge, GeneLab has started processing and analyzing these datasets to generate differential gene expression data and identify biological and physiological pathways that are dysregulated as a result of spaceflight. To aide GeneLab’s efforts to harmonize and democratize space-relevant omics data, over 130 scientists have joined one of four GeneLab Analysis Working Groups (Animal AWG, Plant AWG, Microbe AWG, Multi-Omics AWG) and together helped develop and adopted standard data analysis workflows for all data types available in GeneLab. Currently, the GeneLab Data System includes a data repository with federated search capability, an online controlled-access toolshed powered by ""Galaxy"" for users to process data with vetted standard workflows, a workspace for data sharing, a data submission portal, and the ability to browse and visualize transcriptomics processed data. The user interface was designed to be accessible to a broad variety of users, including high school and college students who can use it to learn about omics data analysis and space biology. The visualization portal enhances GeneLab’s ability to democratize omics data by removing the need for bioinformatics expertise to interpret transcriptomics data hosted on GeneLab. This presentation will provide an over-view of NASA’s GeneLab including how to navigate the GeneLab Data System and will conclude by providing resources for opportunities to work with GeneLab and NASA at large.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20210016328,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""ac4f7a96ca1c5757afab587df766619c"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""California Space Grant Consortium"",""location"":""La Jolla, California, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d5e5afdaf2db40fbbe968f3b2d7ab958"",""id"":""08438cd990314e58a2ef209289a66b84""}],""name"":""CA Space Grant Monthly Webinar Series"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""d5e5afdaf2db40fbbe968f3b2d7ab958"",""startDate"":""2021-04-16T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210016328

This configuration was used to isolate mutations in a set of 350 essential genes as well as in the unc-22 structural gene. From flight samples 13 mutants in the unc-22 gene were isolated along with 53 lethal mutations from autosomal regions balanced by a translocation eT1(III;V).

The software models coarse-grained configurations of chromatin and radiation tracks, small-scale details being suppressed in order to obtain statistical results for larger scales, up to the size of a whole chromosome. We here give an analytic counterpart of the numerical model, useful for benchmarks, for elucidating the numerical results, for analyzing the assumptions of a more general but less mechanistic ""randomly-located-clusters"" formalism, and, potentially, for speeding up the calculations. The equations characterize multi-track DNA fragment-size distributions in terms of one-track action; an important step in extrapolating high-dose laboratory results to the much lower doses of main interest in environmental or occupational risk estimation.

The system will consist of an accumulator, pump, cold plates (evaporators), condenser radiator, and compressor, in addition to control, bypass and throttling valves. For cold environments, the heat will be rejected by radiation, during which the compressor will be bypassed, reducing the system to a simple pumped loop that, depending on heat load, can operate in either a single-phase liquid mode or two-phase mode. For warmer environments, the pump will be bypassed, enabling the TCS to operate as a heat pump. This presentation will focus on recent findings concerning two-phase flow regimes, pressure drop, and heat transfer coefficient trends in the cabin and avionics micro-channel heat exchangers when using the heat pump mode.

20190025476,PRESENTATION,The Effects of CDKN1a/p21 on Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Function During Long Duration Spaceflight,"[""Stimpel, Olivia "",""Almeida, Eduardo A. C."",""Blaber, Elizabeth A."",""Cheng-Campbell, Margareth Ann"",""Jonscher, Karen"",""Pecaut, Michael"",""Schrepfer, Sonja""]","Spaceflight factors, such as microgravity and space radiation, are known to put astronauts at risk for negative effects to their tissue regeneration and degenerative conditions. On our previous spaceflight research, we found that long duration spaceflight produced increased oxidative stress and activation of the inflammatory response as a major contributor to physiological changes, including alterations to the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems, metabolism, and the liver. Proliferation, apoptosis, and ion-channel remodeling of vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as endothelial inflammation, and nitric oxide synthase-nitric oxide system regulation have been shown by spaceflight and simulated spaceflight projects. CDKN1ap21 is a regulatory gene for tissue regeneration and also plays an important role in upregulating oxidative stress caused by radiation. In further research, we have also determined CDKN1ap21 to be overexpressed during spaceflight. When knocked out in mice, however, it protects against unloading-induced changes to the morphology and physiology of carotid arteries. In this proposal, we seek to test a potential dietary countermeasure to down-regulate CDKN1ap21 in the mice and protect against oxidative stress in the rodents. Specifically, we will expose both Wildtype and CDKN1ap21-null mice to hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative stress and observe the molecular mechanisms in which a dietary supplement protects vascular smooth muscle cells against the consequences of the apoptotic environment within Wildtype mice versus the, hypothetically, sound physiology of CDKN1ap21-null mice. The successful completion of this experiment will conclusively determine accuracy of a dietary supplement as a CDKN1ap21 suppressor. This will provide a new perspective on the problem of increased oxidative stress developing into cardiovascular disease as a result of long-term space flight. This research will address the Human Research Plan Roadmaps Risk of Cardiac Rhythm Problems including CV-8, the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Other Degenerative Tissue Effects from Radiation Exposure including Degen-6 and Degen-7, and the Risk of Adverse Health Event from Radiation Exposure including IM-8.

20000020643,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Accelerator-Based Studies of Heavy Ion Interactions Relevant to Space Biomedicine,"[""Miller, J."",""Heilbronn, L."",""Zeitlin, C.""]","Evaluation of the effects of space radiation on the crews of long duration space missions must take into account the interactions of high energy atomic nuclei in spacecraft and planetary habitat shielding and in the bodies of the astronauts. These heavy ions (i.e. heavier than hydrogen), while relatively small in number compared to the total galactic cosmic ray (GCR) charged particle flux, can produce disproportionately large effects by virtue of their high local energy deposition: a single traversal by a heavy charged particle can kill or, what may be worse, severely damage a cell. Research into the pertinent physics and biology of heavy ion interactions has consequently been assigned a high priority in a recent report by a task group of the National Research Council. Fragmentation of the incident heavy ions in shielding or in the human body will modify an initially well known radiation field and thereby complicate both spacecraft shielding design and the evaluation of potential radiation hazards. Since it is impractical to empirically test the radiation transport properties of each possible shielding material and configuration, a great deal of effort is going into the development of models of charged particle fragmentation and transport. Accurate nuclear fragmentation cross sections (probabilities), either in the form of measurements with thin targets or theoretical calculations, are needed for input to the transport models, and fluence measurements (numbers of fragments produced by interactions in thick targets) are needed both to validate the models and to test specific shielding materials and designs. Fluence data are also needed to characterize the incident radiation field in accelerator radiobiology experiments. For a number of years, nuclear fragmentation measurements at GCR-like energies have been carried out at heavy ion accelerators including the LBL Bevalac, Saturne (France), the Synchrophasotron and Nuklotron (Dubna, Russia), SIS-18 (GSI, Germany), the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL AGS) and the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator (HIMAC) in Chiba, Japan. Until fairly recently most of these experiments were done to investigate fundamental problems in nuclear physics, but with the increasing interest in heavy charged particles on the part of the space flight, radiobiology and radiotherapy communities, an increasing number of experiments are being directed at these areas. Some of these measurements are discussed in references therein. Over the past several years, our group has taken cross section and fluence data at the AGS and HIMAC for several incident beams with nuclear charge, Z, between 6 and 26 at energies between 290 and 1050 MeV/nucleon. Iron (Z = 26) has been studied most extensively, since it is the heaviest ion present in significant numbers in the GCR. Targets have included tissue-equivalent and proposed shielding materials, as well as a variety of elemental targets for cross section measurements. Most of the data were taken along the beam axis, but measurements have been made off-axis, as well. Here we present selected data and briefly discuss some implications for spacecraft and planetary habitat design.","[{""submissionId"":20000020643,""id"":""2a52090260ea4cbea56797c761527390"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NASA Order L-14230-C"",""DE-AC03-76SF-00098""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""},{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000020643

20230001374,PRESENTATION,Verification Testing and Veg-05 Tomato Crop Production on the International Space Station,"[""Gioia D. Massa"",""Grace L. Douglas"",""Mary E. Hummerick"",""Matthew W. Romeyn"",""LaShelle E. Spencer"",""Raymond M. Wheeler"",""Millennia Young""]","Production of fresh, nutritious, and tasty produce for astronauts during spaceflight may provide health-promoting, bioavailable nutrients and enhance the dietary experience as we move into longer-duration missions.  Growing and caring for plants may also reduce the psychological stresses associated with spaceflight and enhance connections to Earth.  Requirements to consistently grow a diversity of crops under spaceflight environmental conditions remain poorly defined.  The VEG-05 experiment is part of a series of experiments with pick-and-eat salad crops to better define best practices for crop production and handling in space.  VEG-05 and predecessor experiments VEG-04A and VEG-04B, use the Veggie vegetable production facilities on the International Space Station to grow salad crops under different spectral compositions.  In VEG-04A and B, mizuna mustard was cultivated with two different red: blue light treatments, and in VEG-05 we are cultivating ‘Red Robin’ dwarf cherry tomatoes under the same light spectra.  Light can impact the growth habit, yield, nutritional composition, microbial levels, and even flavor attributes within crops, and our team will assess these characteristics for this crop during VEG-05.  Prior to launch and installation on ISS in late 2022, both a science verification test (SVT), and an experiment verification test (EVT) were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in ISS Environment Simulator Chambers.  Science verification testing, and a previous fertilizer test, grew plants in both plant pillows and PONDS (Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System) units and tested two different fertilizer treatments in both sets of hardware, with each test under only one of the light conditions.  Because of challenges validating the PONDS hardware on ISS, and with good crop production in plant pillows, the EVT moved forward using only plant pillows with the highest fertilizer composition tested during SVT, and two Veggie units were utilized.  One Veggie had light settings consisting of equal levels of red: blue light (150 µmol/m2/s for each color) plus green light (30 µmol/m2/s) while the second Veggie had a 90:10 ratio of red: blue light (270 µmol/m2/s red and 30 µmol/m2/s blue) plus green, so each unit provided 330 µmol/m2/s of photosynthetically active radiation to the tomato crops on average.  Our original plan, based on prior ground testing, was to grow the crop for 104 days and harvest at 80, 90 and 104 days after initiation.  For SVT, under the equal red: blue light treatment, fruit ripening in plant pillows was delayed and fruit were not ripe by day 80, so actual harvest days were days 90, 97, and 104.  For EVT we saw fruit ripening earlier, especially in the high red treatment, and so we harvested at days 83, 90, and 99 days after initiation.  In SVT we had mostly daily watering, and this led to excess water in plant pillows, which leaked out.  This excess water also caused fungus to grow on one leaf and a couple of plant stems.  To reduce this excess moisture, we throttled back the watering for EVT, and used the root mat reservoir more frequently. This led to watering only every other day, reducing crew time needed for plant care, however, two wilting events occurred during this EVT, at days 51 and 75.  Plants recovered from these wilting events, but these events may have influenced the rate of fruit ripening and flower formation. Regardless, more than 10 fruit were produced from each plant on average, with the high red treatment producing slightly heavier fruit.  Microbial testing from fruit during SVT indicated that fruit were safe for consumption with microbial levels below detection limits.  VEG-05 flight and ground operations are expected to run between December 2022 and March 2023.

MF in the spleen of p53+/+ animals increased up to 2.6-fold above spontaneous levels at 8 weeks post irradiation. In contrast, brain MF from the same animals increased 1.7-fold above controls in the same period. In the p53-/- animals, brain MF increased to 2.2-fold above spontaneous levels at 1 week after treatment, but returned to control levels thereafter. Radiation also induced alterations in the spectrum of mutants in both tissues, accompanied by changes in the frequency of mutants with deletions extending past the transgene into mouse genomic DNA. Our results indicate that the accumulation of transgene MF after radiation exposure is dependant on the tissue examined as well as the p53 genetic background of the animals.","[{""volume"":""17 Suppl 1"",""submissionId"":20040088543,""issn"":""1120-1797"",""id"":""896a766fa70e46f6ba0301d73363e3df"",""publicationName"":""Physica medica :  PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG5-6177""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088543

M.""]","Radiation carcinogenesis is one of the major biological effects considered important in the risk assessment for space travel.  Various biological model systems, including both cultured cells and animals, have been found useful for studying the carcinogenic effects of space radiations, which consist of energetic electrons, protons and heavy ions.  The development of techniques for studying neoplastic cell transformation in culture has made it possible to examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of radiation carcinogenesis.  Cultured cell systems are thus complementary to animal models.  Many investigators have determined the oncogenic effects of ionizing and nonionizing radiation in cultured mammalian cells.  One of the cell systems used most often for radiation transformation studies is mouse embryonic cells (C3H10T1/2), which are easy to culture and give good quantitative dose-response curves.  Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for heavy ions with various energies and linear energy transfer (LET) have been obtained with this cell system.  Similar RBE and LET relationship was observed by investigators for other cell systems.  In addition to RBE measurements, fundamental questions on repair of sub- and potential oncogenic lesions, direct and indirect effect, primary target and lesion, the importance of cell-cell interaction and the role of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in radiogenic carcinogenesis have been studied, and interesting results have been found.  Recently several human epithelial cell systems have been developed, and ionizing radiation have been shown to transform these cells.  Oncogenic transformation of these cells, however, requires a long expression time and/or multiple radiation exposures.  Limited experimental data indicate high-LET heavy ions can be more effective than low-LET radiation in inducing cell transformation.  Cytogenetic and molecular analyses can be performed with cloned transformants to provide insights into basic genetic mechanism(s) of radiogenic transformation of human epithelial cells.","[{""volume"":""8"",""submissionId"":20040090020,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0898-4697"",""id"":""39f98d401cd54a56959c0d69725634c3"",""publicationName"":""ASGSB bulletin :  publication of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""publicationDate"":""1995-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090020

Temperature and pressure regulate the presence and duration of liquid water on the surface of Mars. The prolonged presence of liquid water is essential for the evolution and sustained presence of life on a planet. It has been postulated that Mars has always been a cold dry planet; it has also been postulated that early Mars possessed a dense atmosphere of CO2 (greater than or equal to 1 bar) and sufficient water to cut large channels across its surface. The degree to which either of these postulates is true correlates with the suitability of Mars for life's evolution. Although radiation can destroy living systems, the high fluxes of UV radiation on the martian surface do not necessarily stop the origin and early evolution of life. The probability for life to have arisen and evolved to a significant degree on Mars, based on the postulated ranges of early martian physical factors, is almost solely related to the probability of liquid water existing on the planet for at least hundreds of millions to billions of years.","[{""volume"":""15"",""submissionId"":19950035174,""issue"":""3"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""2aa81fe2908b4d43b1d99f38f2aeda4d"",""publicationName"":""Life sciences and space research 24 (4): Planetary biology and origins of life; Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F (Meeting F3) of the COSPAR Plenary Meeting, 29th"",""publicationDate"":""1995-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Biology""]","[{""id"":19950035152,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 24 (4): Planetary Biology and Origins of Life; Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F (Meeting F3) of the COSPAR Plenary Meeting, 29th, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""},{""id"":19950035152,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 24 (4): Planetary Biology and Origins of Life; Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F (Meeting F3) of the COSPAR Plenary Meeting, 29th, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19950035174

20040090216,REPRINT,"Single track effects, Biostack and risk assessment","[""Curtis, S. B."",""Chatterjee, A.""]","The scientific career of Prof. Bucker has spanned a very exciting period in the fledgling science of Space Radiation Biology. The capability for placing biological objects in space was developed, and the methods for properly packaging, retrieving and analyzing them were worked out. Meaningful results on the effects of radiation were obtained for the first time. In fact, many of the successful techniques and methodologies for handling biological samples were developed in Prof. Bucker's laboratories, as attested by the extensive Biostack program. He was the first to suggest and successfully carry out experiments in space directly aimed at measuring effects of single tracks of high-energy heavy galactic cosmic rays by specifically identifying whether or not the object had been hit by a heavy particle track. Because the ""hit"" frequencies of heavy galactic cosmic rays to cell nuclei in the bodies of space travelers will be low, it is expected that any effects to humans on the cellular level will be dominated by single-track cell traversals. This includes the most important generally recognized late effect of space radiation exposure: radiation-induced cancer. This paper addresses the single-track nature of the space radiation environment, and points out the importance of single ""hits"" in the evaluation of radiation risk for long-term missions occurring outside the earth's magnetic field. A short review is made of biological objects found to show increased effects when ""hit"" by a single heavy charged-particle in space. A brief discussion is given of the most provocative results from the bacterial spore Bacillus subtilis: experimental evidence that tracks can affect biological systems at much larger distances from the trajectory than previously suspected, and that the resultant inactivation cross section in space calculated for this system is very large. When taken at face value, the implication of these results, when compared to those from experiments performed at ground-based accelerators with beams at low energies in the same LET range, is that high-energy particles can exert their influence a surprising distance from their trajectory and the inactivation cross sections are some 20 times larger than expected. Clearly, beams from high-energy heavy-ion accelerators should be used to confirm these results. For those end points that can also be caused by low-LET beams such as high-energy protons, it is important to measure their action cross sections as well. The ratio of the cross sections for a high-LET beam to that of a low-LET beam is an interesting experimental ratio and, we suggest, of more intrinsic interest than the RBE (Relative Biological Effectiveness). It is a measure of the ""biological"" importance of one particle type relative to another particle type. This ratio will be introduced and given the name RPPE (Relative Per Particle Effectiveness). Values of RPPE have appeared in the literature and will be discussed. A rather well-known value of this quantity (13,520) has been suggested for the RPPE of high-energy iron ions to high-energy protons. This value was suggested by Letaw et al. Nature 330, 709-710 (1987)] we will call it the Letaw limit. It will be discussed in terms of the importance of the heavy-ion component vs light-ion component of the galactic cosmic rays. It is also pointed out, however, that there may be unique effects from single tracks of heavy ions that do not occur from light-ion tracks. For such effects, the concepts of both RBE and RPPE lose their meaning.","[{""volume"":""23"",""submissionId"":20040090216,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""1350-4487"",""id"":""a1b20686635f4b17a296b8c6793ce9e1"",""publicationName"":""Radiation measurements"",""publicationDate"":""1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090216

Lopez"",""Amanda Saravia-Butler"",""Lauren M. Sanders"",""Samrawit G. Gebre"",""Sylvain V. Costes""]","Increased biomedical risks and challenges associated with deep space missions require knowledge discovery, health countermeasures, and biomedical support capabilities. Maximally open-access and reusable data is needed by developers, scientists, and engineers to develop these systems. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) is a maximally open access and FAIR database (ie., findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), and meets various scientific, technical, and operational needs. It offers users and submitters the ability to upload, download, search, share, analyze, cite, and visualize data 
across ‘omics, physiological, phenotypic, payload, hardware, behavioral, bioimaging, video, and environmental monitoring telemetry datasets. OSDR is an expanded database, based upon the successes of NASA GeneLab.

OSDR has >460 studies with datasets covering model organisms to non-NASA human astronauts. There are ~12 datasets from the Inspiration 4 (I4) mission, spanning metagenomics, comprehensive metabolic panels, clonal hematopoiesis, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and cytokine panels. In the interest of data privacy, two I4 datasets with raw files relating to the epitranscriptome, and a new request feature is live in OSDR (with a backend review process established) developed from industry norms. OSDR is collecting and curating biomedical human data from a new sub-orbital research flight and is open to more space life science/biomedical submissions from the international and commercial sectors. OSDR also recently began a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) to collect and curate >200 terabytes of human and model organism data. The OSDR submission portal is designed to ingest and curate ~25 ‘omics and ~50 physiological-phenotypic-imaging assay data types.

Tools available for OSDR users include: 1) an Environmental Data Application to compare radiation, CO2, relative humidity, temperature, and other telemetry across missions and subjects, 2) the RadLab database, a collaboration between NASA, ESA, the German and Italian Space Agencies, and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, and 3) a Multi-study visualization tool which enables users to look across and combine ‘omics datasets.

There are ~600 volunteer OSDR Analysis Working Group (AWG) members providing feedback on scientific data/metadata standards and collaborating to mine-reuse OSDR in research. OSDR/GeneLab has enabled ~60 publications reusing data as of October 2023.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230015800,""endDate"":""2024-05-09T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""d0b811ba64ca502c8ec8636b127d210e"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f0fb28e7d2f84b1eaa2d019d5891674a"",""id"":""5ce3983fe4b04db4b600688944f88e2b""}],""name"":""AsMA 94th Annual Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""Chicago, IL"",""id"":""f0fb28e7d2f84b1eaa2d019d5891674a"",""url"":""https://www.asma.org/scientific-meetings/asma-annual-scientific-meeting/asma-94th-annual-scientific-meeting-chicago,-il"",""startDate"":""2024-05-05T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""719125.06.01.02.01.02""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Documentation and Information Science"",""Aerospace Medicine"",""Space Radiation"",""Computer Systems"",""Cybernetics, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230015800

Of particular interest are Saturn's moon, Titan; Neptune's moon, Triton; and Pluto where extreme cold conditions prevail. Identifications of chemical species on these objects (surfaces and atmospheres) is essential to a better understanding of the radiation induced chemical reactions occuring thereon. There have been several ground based observations of these planetary objects in the infrared windows from 1 to 2.5 micrometers. Voyager also provided spectra in the thermal infrared (6 to 50 micrometers) region.

The most critical roadblock to full exploitation of the THz band is lack of coherent radiation sources that are powerful (0.001 - 1.0 W continuous wave), efficient (> 1%), frequency agile (instantaneously tunable over 1% bandwidths or more), reliable, and comparatively inexpensive. To develop vacuum electron device (VED) radiation sources satisfying these requirements, fabrication and packaging approaches must be heavily considered to minimize costs, in addition to the basic interaction physics and circuit design. To minimize size of the prime power supply, beam voltage must be minimized, preferably 10 kV. Solid state sources satisfy the low voltage requirement, but are many orders of magnitude below power, efficiency, and bandwidth requirements. On the other hand, typical fast-wave VED sources in this regime (e.g., gyrotrons, FELs) tend to be large, expensive, high voltage and very high power devices unsuitable for most of the applications cited above. VEDs based on grating or inter-digital (ID) circuits have been researched and developed. However, achieving forward-wave amplifier operation with instantaneous fractional bandwidths > 1% is problematic for these devices with low-energy (< 15 kV) electron beams. Moreover, the interaction impedance is quite low unless the beam-circuit spacing is kept particularly narrow, often leading to significant beam interception. One solution to satisfy the THz source requirements mentioned above is to develop micromachined VEDs, or ""micro-VEDs"". Among other benefits, micro-machining technologies provide superior high frequency wall conductivity as a result of superior surface smoothness compared with conventional mechanical or electric discharge machining approaches. Micro-VED technologies are already being applied to the development of millimeter-wave klystrons at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and submillimeter-wave klystrons at the University of Leeds. We are investigating the use of micro-machining technologies to develop THz regime TWTs, with emphasis on folded-waveguide TWTs. The folded-waveguide TWT (FW-TWT) has several features that make it attractive for THz-regime micro-VED applications. It is a relatively simple circuit to design and fabricate, it is amenable to precision pattern replication by micro-machining, and it is has been demonstrated capable of forward-wave amplification with appreciable bandwidth. We are conducting experimental and computational studies of micro-VED FW-TWTs to examine their feasibility for applications at frequencies from 200 - 1000 GHz.","[{""submissionId"":20010059857,""id"":""25034d652f7d4ff18b09cc1cc6e3c9eb"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20010059857,""name"":""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""ef8bd2f7a9d8425c9cfc59ba1c6a8113""},{""country"":""Netherlands"",""submissionId"":20010059857,""endDate"":""2001-04-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""ed6df164134540f49fbd30c61a543d82"",""id"":""35f85c5c973c490788a6a0b08d129664""}],""name"":""International Vacuum Electronics Conference"",""location"":""Noordwijk"",""id"":""ed6df164134540f49fbd30c61a543d82"",""startDate"":""2001-04-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NAS3-27600"",""RTOP 632-6E-51""]",undefined,"[""Electronics And Electrical Engineering""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20010059857

RNA-seq of mice aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days revealed extraordinary hypermutation in tissue-specific genes, with guanine base conversion predominating, potentially contributing to spaceflight-associated health risks. Our results suggest that the genome-wide accelerated mutation that we measured, seemingly independent of radiation dose, was induced by oxidative damage from higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the ISS. This accelerated mutation, faster via RNA transcription than replication and more numerous than by radiation alone, unveils novel hotspots in the mammalian proteome. Notably, these hotspots correlate with commonly mutated genes across various human cancers, highlighting the ISS as a crucial platform for studying accelerated mutation, genome instability, and the induction of disease-causing mutations in model organisms. Our results suggest that metabolic processes can contribute to somatic mutation, and thus may play a role in the development of cancer. A metabolic link to genetic instability potentially has far-reaching implications for various diseases, with implications for human health on Earth and in space.","[{""volume"":""78"",""submissionId"":20240015074,""issue"":""103398"",""publisher"":""Elsevier Science"",""eissn"":""2213-2317"",""id"":""69851df47f2c4427a0a42e6936a7c8b5"",""publicationName"":""Redox Biology"",""publicationDate"":""2024-10-16T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""issuePublicationDate"":""2024-12-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""url"":"""",""doi"":""10.1016/j.redox.2024.103398""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""271118.01.01.10""]",undefined,"[""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240015074

20040050345,ABSTRACT,DNA in a Tunnel: A Comfy Spot for Recognition - or -The Structure of BsoBI Complexed with DNA. What can we Learn about Function via Structure Determination and how can this be Applied to Bone or Muscle Biology?,"[""vanderWoerd, Mark""]","The structure and function of a biologically active molecule are related. To understand its function, it is necessary (but not always sufficient) to know the structure of the molecule. There are many ways of relating the molecular function with the structure. Mutation analysis can identify pertinent amino acids of an enzyme, or alternatively structure comparison of the of two similar molecules with different function may lead to understanding which parts are responsible for a functional aspect, or a series of ""structural cartoons"" - enzyme structure, enzyme plus substrate, enzyme with transition state analog, and enzyme with product - may give insight in the function of a molecule. As an example we will discuss the structure and function of the restriction enzyme BsoBI from Bacillus stearothemzophilus in complex with its cognate DNA. The enzyme forms a unique complex with DNA in that it completely encircles the DNA. The structure reveals the enzyme-DNA contacts, how the DNA is distorted compared with the canonical forms, and elegantly shows how two distinct DNA sequences can be recognized with the same efficiency. Based on the structure we may also propose a hypothesis how the enzymatic mechanism works. The knowledge gained thru studies such as this one can be used to alter the function by changing the molecular structure. Usually this is done by design of inhibitors specifically active against and fitting into an active site of the enzyme of choice. In the case of BsoBI one of the objectives of the study was to alter the enzyme specificity. In bone biology there are many candidates available for molecular study in order to explain, alter, or (temporarily) suspend activity.

The self-repair capability is derived from the regenerative characteristics of living systems. Ultimately, this living membrane will be used to extend the operating life and improve the performance of membrane-based life support systems currently being used by NASA.Biological membranes are primarily composed of lipid bilayers. Lipids are organic compounds that, due to their polar hydrophobic fatty acid tails per lipid molecule, are able to self-assemble spontaneously. The lipid bilayer acts as a selective barrier, letting only specific molecules cross the membrane.

20200002192,PRESENTATION,Circulating miRNA Signature Predicts Health Risks Associated with Cancer and Spaceflight,"[""Beheshti, Afshin""]","Biological risks associated with space radiation and microgravity are major concerns for long-term space travel. Through a Systems Biology approach, our previous NASA work has shown both TGF signaling pathways and miRNAs have a critical impact on defining health risks with and without space irradiation. We hypothesize that circulating microRNA (miRNA) signatures are driving microvascular disease and muscle degeneration associated with accelerating aging and will be enhanced by exposure to the space environment (radiation and microgravity). We are investigating this hypothesis with both in vivo and in vitro models to test novel antagonist therapies to these miRNA signatures as countermeasures to reduce space radiation-induced health risks. A comprehensive Systems Biology approach is utilized to examine the influence by high atomic number by high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) irradiation. To simulate low-dose exposure due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR), we used ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula of 7 different ions to represent GCR (referred to as GCR sim model). To similate high-dose radiation exposure due to solar particle events (SPE), we used a solar particle event (SPE) sim model which gave a total dose of 1Gy protons with energy ranges from 50MeV to 150MeV. C57BL/6 wild-type female mice were utilized for the irradiations with our established simulated microgravity model (hindlimb suspension model) and an in vitro 3D microvasculature tissue model under simulated microgravity (clinostat) conditions was also irradiated. To expand on the circulating miRNA signature determined from our preliminary data, we determined a group of conserved miRNAs which are commonly being regulated in the majority of the organs and tissues throughout the host using our established techniques. MiRNA-sequencing was done on serum (at time of sacrifice), liver, heart, and muscle (soleus muscle) tissue for all radiation groups. Additional validation of the key miRNAs was performed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). This revealed a key circulating miRNA signature (consisting of multiple miRNAs) impacting cardiovascular and muscular disease risk. Further in vitro experiments with CRISPR/Cas9 system to knockout the key miRNA signatures, novel self-delivering antagomirs, overexpression of the miRNAs test the functional impact of the miRNA signatures on both microvascular disease and muscle degeneration due to space irradiation. The current work has started to allow the possible development of a novel minimally invasive miRNA based radioprotector to be used as a countermeasure for space radiation. Collectively, understanding of how whole body space radiation impacts microvascular and tissue degeneration through circulating miRNAs will greatly enhance health risk prognostication and provide possible new mechanisms for protection against space radiation.

S.""]","Recent laboratory experiments are presented that show that during photolysis of the pure ices there is evidence of the interconversion of CO to CO2 and CO2 to CO using Lyman alpha (1216A) radiation. In addition, there is a substantial amount of another substance being produced. This substance is evident by its infrared absorption peak at 2235 cm(-1). It is believed that this new peak is due to carbon suboxide, C3O2. CO and CO2 have already been detected in comets, and C3O2 has been suggested as a cometary from radiation of CO. Comparisons are made between our results at 1215A and proton radiation experiments and radiation at other wavelengths. The suggestion is that the processing of ices is energy dependent, i.e., dependent on the type of radiation. Several difficult problems have to be solved before these radiation conversions can be quantified. The steps that we are taking to quantify the kinetics are discussed.","[{""submissionId"":19920004375,""id"":""33d6465d7db147e0883fdaa1f78d1313"",""publicationName"":""NASA, Washington, Fourth Symposium on Chemical Evolution and the Origin and Evolution of Life"",""publicationDate"":""1991-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Biology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19920004375

20220000549,CONFERENCE_PAPER,BioSentinel: To the Moon or Beyond?,"[""Matthew Napoli"",""Jesse C Fusco"",""Robert Hideo Nakamura""]","BioSentinel, an Artemis-1 secondary spacecraft, will carry a biology  experiment into deep space for the first time in 50 years.  A 6U CubeSat form factor was utilized for the spacecraft and included  technologies newly developed or adapted for operations beyond Earth orbit.  This is the maiden deep-space voyage for the radio, propulsion system, electrical power system, and BioSensor  payload. The spacecraft carries onboard budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as an analog to human cells to test the biological response to deep space radiation.

Flying a secondary payload beyond LEO comes with unique challenges with respect to trajectory uncertainty and mission operations planning. BioSentinel does not carry propulsion for trajectory maneuvers, so plans for Comms and Power need to be developed for all trajectories. The nominal plan is a lunar flyby followed by an insertion into Heliocentric orbit. However, some possible scenarios include lunar eclipses that could severely impact the power budget during that phase of the mission, while others could result in a “Retrograde” hyperbola at swingby resulting in the spacecraft traveling inward toward Earth or even towards a collision with the lunar surface.  BioSentinel’s final trajectory will not be known until after launch and deployment so possible scenarios need to be planned for ahead of time.

This paper discusses the operational scenarios that were planned for as well as the actual execution of the mission operations  including: command pass scheduling with the Deep Space Network, selecting bandwidth limits, medium gain antenna versus low gain antenna usage, and conserving power prior to a lunar eclipse.

Note: Artemis-1 is planned to launch in the Spring of 2022",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220000549,""endDate"":""2022-08-11T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""985c4ef7f20157459c93bed7a92b0dbe"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Utah State University"",""location"":""Logan, Utah, United States""}},""meetingId"":""e3f599bcf32940b882cf5f9b4fc6e94a"",""id"":""6ccbf5c852eb4d01b5b7cd6144b87133""}],""name"":""36th Annual Small Satellite Conference"",""location"":""Logan, UT"",""id"":""e3f599bcf32940b882cf5f9b4fc6e94a"",""url"":""https://smallsat.org/"",""startDate"":""2022-08-06T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"["" 822174.05.01.01""]",undefined,"[""Spacecraft Design, Testing And Performance""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220000549

We review briefly existing measurements of the composition and energy spectra of heavy cosmic ray nuclei, pointing out which species and energy ranges are most critical to assessing cosmic ray risks for spaceflight. Key data sets are identified and a table of cosmic ray abundances is presented for elements from H to Ni (Z = 1 to 28). Because of the 22-year nature of the solar modulation cycle, data from the approaching 1998 solar minimum is especially important to reducing uncertainties in the cosmic ray radiation hazard. It is recommended that efforts to model this hazard take advantage of approaches that have been developed to model the astrophysical aspects of cosmic rays.","[{""volume"":""14"",""submissionId"":19940039107,""issue"":""10"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""07d4d45c8f544e3f953b140687735401"",""publicationName"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1"",""publicationDate"":""1994-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAGW-1919"",""NAS5-722""]",undefined,"[""Space Radiation""]","[{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""},{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940039107

As a mission scientist, I led science activities associated with development, flight, and post-flight analysis of rodent research missions on the ISS in consultation with project engineers, operational specialists, mission PI(s), and mission Implementation Partner(s). I also assessed the feasibility of scientific experiments as a technical and scientific expert in rodent research on the ISS. Eager to learn more about the molecular changes that occur as a result of spaceflight exposure, I transitioned to the NASA GeneLab project where I eventually became the data processing lead. NASA’s GeneLab helps scientists understand how the fundamental building blocks of life – DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites – change from exposure to the space environment including microgravity and cosmic radiation exposure. GeneLab does so by providing fully coordinated epigenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data (collectively known as omics data) alongside essential metadata describing each spaceflight and space-relevant experiment. To maximize the intelligibility of these data, particularly for users with limited bioinformatics knowledge, GeneLab has started processing and analyzing these datasets to generate differential gene expression data and identify biological and physiological pathways that are dysregulated as a result of spaceflight. The user interface was designed to be accessible to a broad variety of users, including high school and college students who can use it to learn about omics data analysis and space biology. During the CA Space Grant Women in STEM Panel event, I will provide an overview of my journey to NASA including my work at NASA on both the Rodent Research and GeneLab projects. I will conclude by providing resources for opportunities to work with GeneLab and NASA at large followed by links to programs designed specifically to engage women in STEM fields.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20210023901,""endDate"":""2021-11-09T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""ac4f7a96ca1c5757afab587df766619c"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""California Space Grant Consortium"",""location"":""La Jolla, California, United States""}},""meetingId"":""55680362f248408a95f6dd84a8329faf"",""id"":""67489f28c1194fbebf4b15c5d1b9e417""}],""name"":""Space Grant Western Region NASA Women in STEM Panel"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""55680362f248408a95f6dd84a8329faf"",""startDate"":""2021-11-09T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""904211.04.01.30.58""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210023901

A."",""Hock, A."",""Kiss, A."",""Borics, G."",""Kiss, K."",""Acs, E."",""Kovacs, G."",""Chong, G."",""Demergasso, C.""]","We present data and results from an ongoing project of astrobiological high-altitude expeditions investigating the highest and least explored perennial lakes on Earth in the Bolivian and Chilean Andes, including several volcanic crater lakes nearing and beyond 6,000 m in elevation. In the next five years, they will provide the first integrated long-term astrobiological characterization and monitoring of lacustrine environments and their biology for such altitude. These extreme lakes are natural laboratories. They provide the field data missing beyond 4,000 m to complete our understanding of terrestrial lakes and biota. Research on the effects of UV has been performed in lower altitude lakes and models of UV flux over time are being developed. Lakes showing a high content of dissolved organic material (DOM) shield organisms from UV. DOM acts as a natural sunscreen as it influences the water transparency, therefore is a determinant of photic zone depth. In sparsely vegetated alpine areas, lakes are clearer and offer less protection from UV to organisms living in the water. Transparent water and high UV irradiance may maximize the penetration and effect of UV radiation. Shallow-water communities in these lakes are particularly sensitive to UV radiation. The periphyton can live on various susbtrates. While on rocks, it includes immobile species that cannot seek low UV refuges unlike sediment-dwelling periphyton or alpine phytoflagellates which undergo vertical migration. Inhibition of algal photosynthesis by UV radiation has been documented in laboratory and showed that phytoplankton production is reduced by formation of nucleic acid lesions or production of peroxides and free oxygen radicals. of peroxides and free oxygen radicals. Our project is providing the field data that is missing from natural laboratories beyond 4,000 m and will complement the vision of the effects of UV on life and its adaptation modes (or lack thereof).","[{""submissionId"":20040065942,""id"":""7596fbb19a1c41e8a3284ab81ec40c4b"",""publicationName"":""Lunar and Planetary Science XXXV: Astrobiology Stew: Pinch of Microbes, Smidgen of UV, Touch of Organics, and Dash of Meteorites"",""publicationDate"":""2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Lunar And Planetary Science And Exploration""]","[{""id"":20040065936,""title"":""Lunar and Planetary Science XXXV: Astrobiology Stew: Pinch of Microbes, Smidgen of UV, Touch of Organics, and Dash of Meteorites""},{""id"":20040065936,""title"":""Lunar and Planetary Science XXXV: Astrobiology Stew: Pinch of Microbes, Smidgen of UV, Touch of Organics, and Dash of Meteorites""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040065942

20040090014,REPRINT,The components of crop productivity:  measuring and modeling plant metabolism,"[""Bugbee, B.""]","Several investigators in the CELSS program have demonstrated that crop plants can be remarkably productive in optimal environments where plants are limited only by incident radiation.  Radiation use efficiencies of 0.4 to 0.7 g biomass per mol of incident photons have been measured for crops in several laboratories.  Some early published values for radiation use efficiency (1 g mol-1) were inflated due to the effect of side lighting.  Sealed chambers are the basic research module for crop studies for space.  Such chambers allow the measurement of radiation and CO2 fluxes, thus providing values for three determinants of plant growth:  radiation absorption, photosynthetic efficiency (quantum yield), and respiration efficiency (carbon use efficiency).  Continuous measurement of each of these parameters over the plant life cycle has provided a blueprint for daily growth rates, and is the basis for modeling crop productivity based on component metabolic processes.  Much of what has been interpreted as low photosynthetic efficiency is really the result of reduced leaf expansion and poor radiation absorption.  Measurements and models of short-term (minutes to hours) and long-term (days to weeks) plant metabolic rates have enormously improved our understanding of plant environment interactions in ground-based growth chambers and are critical to understanding plant responses to the space environment.","[{""volume"":""8"",""submissionId"":20040090014,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0898-4697"",""id"":""6b108c4f0a184722a89a68ced04fbd42"",""publicationName"":""ASGSB bulletin :  publication of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""publicationDate"":""1995-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090014

20190033204,PRESENTATION,Biological CubeSats: What Have We Learned so Far and What Is Next?,"[""Santa Maria, Sergio R."",""Zea, Luis"",""Ricco, Tony""]","Since Apollo 17 in 1972, NASA has sent no humans or other biological organisms outside of Earth's protective magnetosphere. Recently, NASA has set its sights on human exploration in deep space, with an ambitous plan to put astronauts back on the Moon by 2024 and to eventually land human missions on Mars. Such missions will require significant countermeasures, likely both technological and biomedical, to protect biology from chronic radiation exposure. CubeSats can inform these countermeasures by querying relevant space environments with model organisms.NASA has launched five biological CubeSat missions into low-Earth orbit (LEO). GeneSat-1 was launched in 2006 to study gene expression and increase our knowledge of how spaceflight affects microbes. Similar life-support technologies were then used in PharmaSat and O/OREOS, which launched in 2009 and 2010, respectively. PharmaSat contained optical systems to examine how yeast cells responded to an antifungal treatment. One of O/OREOS payloads, SESLO (Space Environment Survivability of Living Organisms), housed dormant microorganisms, which were rehydrated on orbit to track alterations to growth and metabolism induced by microgravity and radiation. In 2014, NASA launched SporeSat to study the mechanisms of plant cell gravity sensing using lab-on-a-chip devices. Most recently, in 2017, NASA launched EcAMSat (E. coli AntiMicrobial Satellite), which investigated the effects of microgravity on antibiotic resistance of a pathogenic bacterium. Each one of these missions increased our understanding of the biological effects of spaceflight in LEO, while refining technologies and imparting valuable lessons to the next generation of CubeSats.CubeSats housing translational biological models are therefore ideal for defining the hazards of deep space travel, as they can provide critical data over relevant durations. BioSentinel, a next-generation deep-space CubeSat, is planned to launch as a secondary payload on Artemis 1 in 2020. BioSentinel will study the DNA damage response to deep space radiation in yeast.","[{""submissionId"":20190033204,""id"":""f5b89842cd884a6b8e27e1590e3e3a7d"",""publicationDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190033204,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""81df2d8bf186497ab7bffb4f59f673e8""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190033204,""endDate"":""2019-11-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""16e329bf3204443d84b7d04895b63dfe"",""id"":""c43cf6ae6b8a4c2f80b18884a441e8a4""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""16e329bf3204443d84b7d04895b63dfe"",""startDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190033204
20030065931,ABSTRACT,Towards the Structure Determination of a Modulated Protein Crystal: The Semicrystalline State of Profilin:Actin,"[""Borgstahl, G."",""Lovelace, J."",""Snell, E. H."",""Bellamy, H.""]","One of the remaining challenges to structural biology is the solution of modulated structures. While small molecule crystallographers have championed this type of structure, to date, no modulated macromolecular structures have been determined. Modulation of the molecular structures within the crystal can produce satellite reflections or a superlattice of reflections in reciprocal space. We have developed the data collection methods and strategies that are needed to collect and analyze these data. If the macromolecule's crystal lattice is composed of physiologically relevant packing contacts, structural changes induced under physiological conditions can cause distortion relevant to the function and biophysical processes of the molecule making up the crystal. By careful measurement of the distortion, and the corresponding three-dimensional structure of the distorted molecule, we will visualize the motion and mechanism of the biological macromolecule(s). We have measured the modulated diffraction pattern produced by the semicrystalline state of profilin:actin crystals using highly parallel and highly monochromatic synchrotron radiation coupled with fine phi slicing (0.001-0.010 degrees) for structure determination. These crystals present these crystals present a unique opportunity to address an important question in structural biology. The modulation is believed to be due to the formation of actin helical filaments from the actin beta ribbon upon the pH-induced dissociation of profilin. To date, the filamentous state of actin has resisted crystallization and no detailed structures are available. The semicrystalline state profilin:actin crystals provides a unique opportunity to understand the many conformational states of actin. This knowledge is essential for understanding the dynamics underlying shape changes and motility of eukaryotic cells. Many essential processes, such as cytokinesis, phagocytosis, and cellular migration depend upon the capacity of the actin microfilament system to be restructured in a controlled manner via polymerization, depolymerization, severing, cross-linking, and anchorage. The structure the semicrystalline state of profilin:actin will challenge and validate current models of muscle contraction and cell motility. The methodology and theory under development will be easily extendable to other systems.","[{""submissionId"":20030065931,""id"":""4608c00359304d1bba11563f41339fa9"",""publicationDate"":""2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20030065931,""name"":""American Crystallographic Association"",""location"":""Buffalo, NY, United States"",""id"":""6e73b339722c467e808bd52ab31b8f67""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20030065931,""endDate"":""2003-07-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Crystallographic Association"",""location"":""Buffalo, NY, United States""}},""meetingId"":""85b6452746e1413dbe20e0ca13cc1899"",""id"":""71ca7ab6a64749bd93335ea08ad06e1c""}],""name"":""American Crystallographic Association"",""location"":""Covington, KY"",""id"":""85b6452746e1413dbe20e0ca13cc1899"",""startDate"":""2003-07-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NCC-866""]",undefined,"[""Nonmetallic Materials""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20030065931

20150022366,ABSTRACT,3D Printing of Advanced Biocomposites on Earth and Beyond,"[""Rothschild, Lynn J."",""Gentry, Diana M."",""Micks, Ashley""]","Human exploration off planet is severely limited by the cost of launching materials into space and re-supply. Thus materials brought from earth must be light, stable and reliable at destination. Using traditional approaches a lunar or Mars base would require either transporting a hefty store of metals or heavy manufacturing equipment and construction materials for in situ extraction; both would severely limit any other mission objectives. Long-term human space presence requires periodic replenishment, adding a massive cost overhead. Even robotic missions often sacrifice science goals for heavy radiation and thermal protection. Biology has the potential to solve these problems because it can replicate and repair itself, and do a wide variety of chemical reactions including making food, fuel and materials. Synthetic biology can greatly enhance and expand life's evolved repertoire. Using natural and synthetically altered organisms as the feedstock for additive manufacturing could one day make possible the dream of producing bespoke tools, food, smart fabrics and even replacement organs on demand. To this end our lab has produced a proof-of-concept bioprinter with nearly one-cell resolution. Genetically engineering yeast cells to secrete bioproducts subsequent to printing allows the potential to make biomaterials with a fine microstructure. Imagine a production system that, at a few micron scale resolution, can add mollusk shell for compressive strength per unit mass, spider silk or collagen for tensile strength per unit mass, and potentially biologically-deposited wires.

20040088566,REPRINT,"Genomic instability, bystander effect, cytoplasmic irradiation and other phenomena that may achieve fame without fortune","[""Hall, E. J.""]","The possible risk of induced malignancies in astronauts, as a consequence of the radiation environment in space, is a factor of concern for long term missions. Cancer risk estimates for high doses of low LET radiation are available from the epidemiological studies of the A-bomb survivors. Cancer risks at lower doses cannot be detected in epidemiological studies and must be inferred by extrapolation from the high dose risks. The standard setting bodies, such as the ICRP recommend a linear, no-threshold extrapolation of risks from high to low doses, but this is controversial. A study of mechanisms of carcinogenesis may shed some light on the validity of a linear extrapolation. The multi-step nature of carcinogenesis suggests that the role of radiation may be to induce a mutation leading to a mutator phenotype. High energy Fe ions, such as those encountered in space are highly effective in inducing genomic instability. Experiments involving the single particle microbeam have demonstrated a ""bystander effect"", ie a biological effect in cells not themselves hit, but in close proximity to those that are, as well as the induction of mutations in cells where only the cytoplasm, and not the nucleus, have been traversed by a charged particle. These recent experiments cast doubt on the validity of a simple linear extrapolation, but the data are so far fragmentary and conflicting. More studies are necessary. While mechanistic studies cannot replace epidemiology as a source of quantitative risk estimates, they may shed some light on the shape of the dose response relationship and therefore on the limitations of a linear extrapolation to low doses.","[{""volume"":""17 Suppl 1"",""submissionId"":20040088566,""issn"":""1120-1797"",""id"":""e428719b763645fbaa502ad6a5a22852"",""publicationName"":""Physica medica :  PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""CA49062"",""CA 73946"",""P41 RR11623-03"",""NAG9-1148""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088566
20130001723,ABSTRACT,Late Effects of Heavy Ion Irradiation on Ex Vivo Osteoblastogenesis and Cancellous Bone Microarchitecture,"[""Tran, Luan Hoang"",""Alwood, Joshua"",""Kumar, Akhilesh"",""Limoli, C. L."",""Globus, Ruth""]","Prolonged spaceflight causes degeneration of skeletal tissue with incomplete recovery even after return to Earth. We hypothesize that heavy ion irradiation, a component of Galactic Cosmic Radiation, damages osteoblast progenitors and may contribute to bone loss during long duration space travel beyond the protection of the Earth's magnetosphere. Male, 16 week old C57BL6/J mice were exposed to high LET (56 Fe, 600MeV) radiation using either low (5 or 10cGy) or high (50 or 200cGy) doses at the NASA Space Radiation Lab and were euthanized 3 - 4, 7, or 35 days later. Bone structure was quantified by microcomputed tomography (6.8 micron pixel size) and marrow cell redox assessed using membrane permeable, free radical sensitive fluorogenic dyes. To assess osteoblastogenesis, adherent marrow cells were cultured ex vivo, then mineralized nodule formation quantified by imaging and gene expression analyzed by RT PCR. Interestingly, 3 - 4 days post exposure, fluorogenic dyes that reflect cytoplasmic generation of reactive nitrogen/oxygen species (DAF FM Diacetate or CM H2DCFDA) revealed irradiation (50cGy) reduced free radical generation (20-45%) compared to sham irradiated controls. Alternatively, use of a dye showing relative specificity for mitochondrial superoxide generation (MitoSOX) revealed an 88% increase compared to controls. One week after exposure, reactive oxygen/nitrogen levels remained lower(24%) relative to sham irradiated controls. After one month, high dose irradiation (200 cGy) caused an 86% decrement in ex vivo nodule formation and a 16-31% decrement in bone volume to total volume and trabecular number (50, 200cGy) compared to controls. High dose irradiation (200cGy) up regulated expression of a late osteoblast marker (BGLAP) and select genes related to oxidative metabolism (Catalase) and DNA damage repair (Gadd45). In contrast, lower doses (5, 10cGy) did not affect bone structure or ex vivo nodule formation, but did down regulate iNOS by 0.54 - 0.58 fold. Thus, both low and high doses of heavy ion irradiation cause time dependent, adaptive changes in redox state within marrow cells but only high doses (50, 200cGy) inhibit osteoblastogenesis and cause cancellous bone loss. We conclude space radiation has the potential to cause persistent damage to bone marrow derived stem and progenitor cells for osteoblasts despite adaptive changes in cellular redox state.","[{""submissionId"":20130001723,""id"":""f47e9acbe8d74a64ac029f95c8c1c370"",""publicationDate"":""2012-12-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20130001723,""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States"",""id"":""b3739c6ff6694f25b2e37d05cca077b4""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20130001723,""endDate"":""2012-12-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""5f1fd59da7314bbf82c5c98ae52a6a83"",""id"":""ce542af0bbe046e4aef8f8b84f55d3ca""}],""name"":""2012 Annual American Society for Cell Biology Meeting"",""location"":""San Francisco, CA"",""id"":""5f1fd59da7314bbf82c5c98ae52a6a83"",""startDate"":""2012-12-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNX09AG76A"",""NNH06CC03B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20130001723
19850042289,REPRINT,New estimates of asymmetric decomposition of racemic mixtures by natural beta-radiation sources,"[""Hegstrom, R. A."",""Rich, A."",""Van House, J.""]","Some recent calculations that appeared to invalidate the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis, which suggests that the chirality of biological molecules originates from the beta-radiolysis of prebiotic racemic mixtures, are reexamined. These calculations apparently showed that the radiolysis-induced chiral polarization can never exceed the chiral polarization produced by statistical fluctuations. It is here shown that several overly restrictive conditions were imposed on these calculations which, when relaxed, allow the radiolysis-induced polarization to exceed that produced by statistical fluctuations, in accordance with the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis.","[{""volume"":""313"",""submissionId"":19850042289,""issn"":""0028-0836"",""id"":""20052a98412040118c38d2163ba13082"",""publicationName"":""Nature"",""publicationDate"":""1985-01-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Biology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19850042289
20050156621,ABSTRACT,Calibration and Characterization of the NASA EOS Terra and Aqua MODIS Instruments,"[""Salomonson, Vincent V.""]","The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument is operating on both of the Terra and Aqua missions within the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS). The Terra MODIS instrument began taking observations in February 2000 and the Aqua MODIS instrument began taking observations in June of 2002 and both continue to operate successfully up to the present time. The MODIS instrument scans the entire Earth every 24 hours at nominal spatial resolutions between 250 and 1000 meters. It has 36 spectral bands spanning the electromagnetic spectrum from the visible wavelengths mar 400 micrometers to the emissive thermal infrared wavelengths at 15 micrometers. The MODIS instruments produce approximately 40 geophysical products devoted to observing land, ocean, and atmospheric processes and trends. To meet the scientific objectives associated with the NASA Earth sciences efforts the MODIS instruments must be and have been carefully calibrated and the performance characterized to meet specifications and goals such as five percent radiance and two percent relative to the sun accuracy in the twenty bands providing reflected solar radiation observations and one percent radiance accuracy in the sixteen bands observing in the thermal infrared. Over the time spanning instrument development and the pre-launch calibration and characterization of the instrument through the years of operation in space, the performance of the MODIS instruments have changed in multiple ways and appropriate adjustments made in relevant algorithms and look-up tables necessary to produce observations that meet the scientific objectives and requirements. The changes have been quantified and accounted for through careful use of on-board calibration devices such as the Spectro-Radiometric Calibration Assembly (SRCA), the Solar Diffuser (SD) and its companion Solar Diffuser Stability Monitor (SDSM), deep-space and lunar observations, and calibration targets on the Earth's surface. The strictest and most difficult challenges have come in trying to meet the requirements for observing Ocean color and related ocean biology processes over time and space. Overall the MODIS observations have been very successful in providing valuable scientific and applications results. The essential capabilities of MODIS are to be provided in the future by the Visible and Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite Series (NPOESS).","[{""submissionId"":20050156621,""id"":""13242d985d9e44d8b2e15e6faee942ce"",""publicationDate"":""2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Spacecraft Instrumentation And Astrionics""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050156621
20000020485,CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS,Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop,undefined,"The First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop, held January 11-13, 1999, was unique in that it assembled, for the first time, a broad cross section of NASA-funded biomedical researchers to present the current status of their projects and their plans for future investigations. All principal investigators with active, or recently-completed ground-based projects in NASA's Biomedical Research and Countermeasures Program that were funded through NASA's Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications were invited. Included were individual investigators funded through NASA Research Announcements, investigators with NASA Specialized Centers of Research and Training, investigators with the recently established National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI), and NASA civil servant investigators. Seventy-seven percent of all eligible projects were presented at the workshop. Thus, these Proceedings should provide a useful snapshot of the status of NASA-funded space biomedical research as of January 1999. An important workshop objective was to achieve free and open communication among the presenting investigators. Therefore, presentation of new and incomplete results, as well as hypotheses and ideas for future research, was encouraged. Comments and constructive criticisms from the presenters' colleagues were also encouraged. These ground rules resulted in many lively and useful discussions, during both the presentation sessions and informal evening gatherings and breaks.","[{""submissionId"":20000020485,""id"":""65c70d9d95fc4c00b3e9b88575264673"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators'

20040088559,REPRINT,Physical and biological studies with protons and HZE particles in a NASA supported research center in radiation health,"[""Chatterjee, A."",""Borak, T. H.""]","NASA has established and supports a specialized center for research and training (NSCORT) to specifically address the potential deleterious effects of HZE particles on human health. The NSCORT in radiation health is a joint effort between Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and Colorado State University (CSU). The overall scope of research encompasses a broad range of subjects from microdosimetric studies to cellular and tissue responses to initial damage produced by highly energetic protons and heavy charged particles of the type found in galactic cosmic rays (GCR) spectrum. The objectives of the microdosimetry studies are to determine the response of Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC) to cosmic rays using ground based accelerators. This includes evaluation of energy loss due to the escape of high-energy delta rays and increased energy deposition due to the enhanced delta ray production in the wall of the detector. In this report major results are presented for 56Fe at 1000, 740, 600 and 400 MeV/nucleon. An assessment of DNA repair and early development of related chromosomal changes is extremely important to our overall understanding of enhanced biological effectiveness of high LET particle radiation. Results are presented with respect to the fidelity of the rejoining of double strand breaks and the implications of misrejoining. The relationship between molecular and cytogenetic measurements is presented by studying damage processing in highly heterochromatic supernumerary (correction of sypernumerary) X chromosomes and the active X-chromosome. One of the important consequences of cell's inability to handle DNA damage can be evaluated through mutation studies. Part of our goal is the assessment of potential radioprotectors to reduce the mutation yield following HZE exposures, and some promising results are presented on one compound. A second goal is the integration of DNA repair and mutation studies. Results are presented on a direct comparison of initial double strand breaks induction, the time course and fidelity of double strand break rejoining, cell killing and mutation induction in the same human model system. In order to understand the carcinogenic potential of protons and HZE particles, the role of damaged microenvironment in this process must be understood. In this project it has been postulated that radiation affects the microenvironment, which then modifies cell interactions in a manner conducive to neoplastic progression. Both TGF-beta and FGF-2 are important components of microenvironment. A recent result on the assessment of the role of FGF-2 and its cross-talk with TGF-beta as a function of radiation quality is presented. Theoretical modeling has so far played a central role in analyzing and integrating experimental data on repair and mutation studies and predicting new phenomena. The integrated NSCORT program also provides a broad training experience for students and postdoctoral fellows in space radiation health.","[{""volume"":""17 Suppl 1"",""submissionId"":20040088559,""issn"":""1120-1797"",""id"":""cf38d4d385f14e1596b5bde552ac6ad8"",""publicationName"":""Physica medica :  PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088559

20140012826,ABSTRACT,"Development of an Autonomous, Dual Chamber Bioreactor for the Growth of 3-Dimensional Epithelial-Stromal Tissues in Microgravity","[""Patel, Zarana S."",""Wettergreen, Matthew A."",""Huff, Janice L.""]","We are developing a novel, autonomous bioreactor that can provide for the growth and maintenance in microgravity of 3‐D organotypic epithelial‐stromal cultures that require an air‐liquid interface. These complex 3‐D tissue models accurately represent the morphological features, differentiation markers, and growth characteristics observed in normal human epithelial tissues, including the skin, esophagus, lung, breast, pancreas, and colon. However, because of their precise and complex culture requirements, including that of an air‐liquid interface, these 3‐D models have yet to be utilized for life sciences research aboard the International Space Station. The development of a bioreactor for these cultures will provide the capability to perform biological research on the ISS using these realistic, tissue‐like human epithelial‐stromal cell models and will contribute significantly to advances in fundamental space biology research on questions regarding microgravity effects on normal tissue development, aging, cancer, and other disease processes. It will also allow for the study of how combined stressors, such as microgravity with radiation and nutritional deficiencies, affect multiple biological processes and will provide a platform for conducting countermeasure investigations on the ISS without the use of animal models. The technology will be autonomous and consist of a cell culture chamber that provides for air‐liquid, liquid‐liquid, and liquid‐air exchanges within the chambers while maintaining the growth and development of the biological samples. The bioreactor will support multiple tissue types and its modular design will provide for incorporation of add‐on capabilities such as microfluidics drug delivery, media sampling, and in situ biomarker analysis. Preliminary flight testing of the hardware will be conducted on a parabolic platform through NASA's Flight Opportunities Program.","[{""submissionId"":20140012826,""id"":""fbe2dae9663c4575ad1b66ef9575d7da"",""publicationDate"":""2014-06-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140012826,""name"":""American Astronomical Society"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States"",""id"":""3fffc204118344f1be263461cb4201b4""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140012826,""endDate"":""2014-06-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Center for the Advancement of Science in Space, Inc."",""location"":""Tallahassee, FL, United States""}},""meetingId"":""fa9a9fd981b849dc81174e7ad74282ad"",""id"":""a3da6b4b12224efeba33b62152cbffcf""},{""organizationId"":""6830966a5868480e8dc1fa2fa0bf63c1"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""fa9a9fd981b849dc81174e7ad74282ad"",""id"":""7a3aaf1593fa4c1e92cd1d4f94bf31a8""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Astronomical Society"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""fa9a9fd981b849dc81174e7ad74282ad"",""id"":""a2fad0b86f014ea59736dc19839795b3""}],""name"":""Annual ISS Research and Development Conference"",""location"":""Chicago, IL"",""id"":""fa9a9fd981b849dc81174e7ad74282ad"",""startDate"":""2014-06-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Exobiology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140012826

Under low photosynthetic photon flux (40-400 micromoles m-2 s-1 PPF), development (e.g. anthesis) was retarded, but heads (often sterile) always formed, even if light was so low that plants died before the heads could mature. Longer photoperiods promoted flowering, but night interruptions combined with short days did not provoke a long-day response as occurs with true long-day plants. The long-day effect could prove to be a summation of photosynthetic products. Heat stress (40 degrees C for 1-24 h) did not influence flowering but killed plants that were 13-16-day-old (no effect on younger plants). Concentrations of iodine or silver-fluoride disinfectants present in the water used for plants on Mir (1.0-4.0 mg L-1) did not affect plant growth although higher concentrations (8.0-1.6 mg L-1) were inhibitory. GA3 or indoleacetic acid applied every other day at concentrations from 1.0 x 10(-6) mg L-1 to 3.162 x 10(-4) mg L-1 did not change the height of Super-Dwarf wheat, suggesting that this cultivar is not a gibberellin mutant.","[{""volume"":""152"",""submissionId"":20040089389,""issn"":""0176-1617"",""id"":""df50089c4bfa4fb5827cf105a9d560ae"",""publicationName"":""Journal of plant physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NCC2-831""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089389

Having multiple and repeated spaceflight experiments for model organisms to solve these space stressors is costly and time consuming. Therefore, reusing and reanalyzing legacy experiments is one way that scientists can draw new conclusions in a timely manner and without using too many resources. Moreover, advances in general biological knowledge allows legacy experiments to be placed into more complete context.Here we aim to analyze all data and metadata taken from rats flown on the SLS-1 mission to create a comprehensive biological model that can be supplemented with current data to allow new discoveries in how space flown organisms adapt to the space environment. Our approach begins with the identification of all the data and metadata, including graphs and tables, for SLS-1 in NASA archives and other sources. Then, each piece of data and metadata will be digitized, reformatted and analyzed. Lastly, a previously developed astronaut model will be used to create the data framework and a comprehensive biological rodent model. The datasets we are using is from the 1991 SpaceLab Life Science 1 (SLS-1) NASA Mission. This was the first designated spacelab mission flown.

20130000557,ABSTRACT,Can Terrestrial Microbes Grow on Mars?,"[""Rothschild, Lynn""]","The theme for AbSciCon 2012 is ""Exploring Life: Past and Present, Near and Far."" The conference will address our current understanding of life - from processes at the molecular level to those which operate at planetary scales. Studying these aspects of life on Earth provides an essential platform from which to examine the potential for life on other worlds, both within our solar system and beyond. Mars exhibits a variety of extreme environments characterized by high UV and ionizing radiation flux, low pressure anoxic atmosphere, scarce or absent liquid water, extreme low temperatures, etc. The ability of terrestrial microorganisms to survive and adapt to the Mars environment has profound implications for astrobiology, planetary protection, and Mars life detection missions. At the NASA Ames Synthetic Biology Initiative, we believe that synthetic biology has the potential to revolutionize human space exploration. As such, the initiative is dedicated to applying the tools and techniques of synthetic biology to space exploration and astrobiology. Biological solutions will be invaluable for space exploration because they are not resource intensive, and they are versatile and self-renewing. An understanding of how to work with DNA in an unfavorable environment is paramount to utilizing biological tools on space missions. Furthermore, the ability to adjust life to the parameters of Mars is vital both to discovering what life on Mars might look like, and to using biological tools under such conditions. As a first step, we need an energy-efficient, low cost means of transporting, storing, and protecting genomic DNA, DNA parts, and whole microbial strains. Our goal is to develop and demonstrate viable and superior alternatives to standard DNA storage methods, which can be optimized to the conditions of space exploration, using synthetic biology as a tool. This includes protocols and kit designs for easy and repeatable DNA and strain recovery from protective storage conditions. We are constructing newly engineered genetic parts for different valuable host organisms, designed to increased long-term survival and functional retention. These methods should be applied for DNA and strain storage and transportation. In parallel, we seek inspiration from natural organisms that have developed means for survival in extreme environmental conditions. We are utilizing novel techniques for analysis of lipid biomarkers in the Antarctic Dry Valleys in order to identify resident microbes in the Antarctic soil and permafrost, as well as biomarker fossils of organisms that survived in the valleys in ages past. Through the identification of these life forms, we hope to understand and draw on new biological tools and strategies for synthetic biological applications on Mars.","[{""submissionId"":20130000557,""id"":""ef47965b632542079a05ef902565a509"",""publicationDate"":""2012-04-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20130000557,""endDate"":""2012-04-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Astrobiology Science Conference 2012 (AbSciCn)"",""location"":""Atlanta, GA"",""id"":""2cc7995b776b4938958ed7cee03546a7"",""startDate"":""2012-04-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Exobiology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20130000557
20220000142,PRESENTATION,Effects of Spaceflight Relevant Carbon Dioxide Levels on Pathogenesis Related Microbial Characteristics,"[""A A Medina-Colorado"",""C A Nickerson "",""C M Ott""]","BACKGROUND Multiple stressors in the spaceflight environment have the potential to alter microbial pathogenesis and virulence characteristics, including microgravity, radiation, and hostile/confined conditions. This combination of factors may lead to a stacking of risks, potentially creating unexpected increase in the risk of infectious disease. One understudied variable is the higher CO2 atmospheric concentration. The current Spaceflight Maximum Allowance Concentration (SMAC) for 24-hour average CO2 is 0.4% (3 mm Hg). These elevated ambient CO2 levels aboard the ISS could potentially influence the diversity and phenotypic responses of the resident microbial communities from both the spacecraft environment (air, surface, water) and crewmembers (gut, nasal, skin microbiomes).  

METHODS For these studies, we will evaluate the response of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes, which are opportunistic pathogens that are of medical significance and have been or are likely to be found aboard spacecraft.  These microorganisms will be cultured in both spaceflight analog and control conditions at CO2levels representing terrestrial atmospheric concentration of 0.04% (0.3 mmHg), ISS elevated concentration of 0.4% (3 mm Hg), and an unexpected elevated concentration of 1 % (7.6 mmHg) to represent a worst case scenario. 

DISCUSSION Overwhelming evidence from studies performed in food microbiology, marine biology and terrestrial environmental biology suggest altered gene expression, selective bacterial inhibition, increased growth and diversity, and increased antibiotic resistance of bacterial communities individually and in biofilm formation when exposed to increased levels of CO2. While many of these findings are based on levels of CO2 higher than would be found during spaceflight exploration missions, the potential for subtle changes in CO2 levels to exacerbate infectious disease risks warrants an evaluation of pathogen responses to spaceflight CO2 conditions. Our study will provide answers to spaceflight relevant atmospheric conditions, as described in the Risk of Adverse Health Effects Due to Host-Microorganism Interaction (GapMicro 103).

20110008211,ABSTRACT,The Sensitivity of Simulated Ocean Biogeochemistry to Forcing Fields Derived from NCEP and MERRA Reanalysis Products,"[""Gregg, Watson"",""Casey, Nancy""]","Ocean biogeochemistry models are typically forced by atmospheric and oceanic data derived from reanalysis products. For the NASA Ocean Biogeochemistry Model (NOBM) such reanalysis forcing fields include: surface wind stress, sea surface temperature, ice distributions, shortwave radiation, surface wind speeds and surface atmospheric pressure. Additionally, proper computation of ocean irradiance requires reanalysis products of relative humidity and precipitable water (in addition to aerosol and cloud information which is derived from satellite data). The question posed here is, does the choice of reanalysis products make a difference in the representation of ocean biology and biogeochemistry? NOBM was forced by NCEP and MERRA reanalysis products for the period 2002-2009. We find that in 2009 global distributions and abundances of biological variables (total chlorophyll and nutrients) and carbon (dissolved inorganic and organic carbon and surface pCO2) were similar between the two different forcing fields. Global statistical comparisons with satellite and in situ data also showed negligible differences.","[{""submissionId"":20110008211,""id"":""8460b029aed74f7592923077fe101117"",""publicationDate"":""2010-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Oceanography""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110008211
20040090355,REPRINT,Light-induced phosphorylation of a membrane protein plays an early role in signal transduction for phototropism in Arabidopsis thaliana,"[""Reymond, P."",""Short, T. W."",""Briggs, W. R."",""Poff, K. L.""]","Blue light is known to cause rapid phosphorylation of a membrane protein in etiolated seedlings of several plant species, a protein that, at least in etiolated pea seedlings and maize coleoptiles, has been shown to be associated with the plasma membrane.  The light-driven phosphorylation has been proposed on the basis of correlative evidence to be an early step in the signal transduction chain for phototropism.  In the Arabidopsis thaliana mutant JK224, the sensitivity to blue light for induction of first positive phototropism is known to be 20- to 30-fold lower than in wild type, whereas second positive curvature appears to be normal.  While light-induced phosphorylation can be demonstrated in crude membrane preparations from shoots of the mutant, the level of phosphorylation is dramatically lower than in wild type, as is the sensitivity to blue light.  Another A. thaliana mutant, JK218, that completely lacks any phototropic responses to up to 2 h of irradiation, shows a normal level of light-induced phosphorylation at saturation.  Since its gravitropic sensitivity is normal, it is presumably blocked in some step between photoreception and the confluence of the signal transduction pathways for phototropism and gravitropism.  We conclude from mutant JK224 that light-induced phosphorylation plays an early role in the signal transduction chain for phototropism in higher plants.","[{""volume"":""89"",""submissionId"":20040090355,""issue"":""10"",""issn"":""0027-8424"",""id"":""1a3113d23a6e48f5b9f53b4f3e8261bc"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"",""publicationDate"":""1992-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DCB-88 19137"",""DE-FG02-90ER-20021""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090355
20140002287,OTHER,Development of the Code RITRACKS,"[""Plante, Ianik"",""Cucinotta, Francis A.""]","A document discusses the code RITRACKS (Relativistic Ion Tracks), which was developed to simulate heavy ion track structure at the microscopic and nanoscopic scales. It is a Monte-Carlo code that simulates the production of radiolytic species in water, event-by-event, and which may be used to simulate tracks and also to calculate dose in targets and voxels of different sizes. The dose deposited by the radiation can be calculated in nanovolumes (voxels). RITRACKS allows simulation of radiation tracks without the need of extensive knowledge of computer programming or Monte-Carlo simulations. It is installed as a regular application on Windows systems. The main input parameters entered by the user are the type and energy of the ion, the length and size of the irradiated volume, the number of ions impacting the volume, and the number of histories. The simulation can be started after the input parameters are entered in the GUI. The number of each kind of interactions for each track is shown in the result details window. The tracks can be visualized in 3D after the simulation is complete. It is also possible to see the time evolution of the tracks and zoom on specific parts of the tracks. The software RITRACKS can be very useful for radiation scientists to investigate various problems in the fields of radiation physics, radiation chemistry, and radiation biology. For example, it can be used to simulate electron ejection experiments (radiation physics).","[{""submissionId"":20140002287,""id"":""15e01a1cd09c4ff2bfaab17b3c3c0c2a"",""publicationName"":""NASA Tech Briefs, October 2013"",""publicationDate"":""2013-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]","[{""id"":20140001106,""title"":""NASA Tech Briefs, October 2013""},{""id"":20140001106,""title"":""NASA Tech Briefs, October 2013""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140002287

20220000418,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Lunar Base Construction Overview,"[""Robert P. Mueller""]","Previous lunar missions and campaigns have been restricted to using robotic landers and lunar
orbiting satellites as well as sortie type of operations using astronaut crews (NASA Apollo
program). Now, the next phase of lunar exploration has begun under NASA’s Artemis program
and there has been an international response where other nations such as China, Russia, India,
Canada, Japan and the European Union of nations, have all expressed interest in either
collaborating or competing with NASA on the Moon. This next phase has an over arching goal
of achieving a permanent human presence on the Moon via sustainable methods.

A lunar base with human occupancy will require infrastructure to provide shelter, utilities,
landing/launch pads, roads, communications, power and all the other necessities to sustain
human life and protect equipment. Since human biology is not well suited for surviving in the
lunar environment, there will be many forms of automated equipment, autonomy and robotic
helpers that will minimize the amount of Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) required by the crew.
This will mean that the radiation dosage received by the crew will stay within acceptable and
safe career doses. Radiation shielding via the use of regolith can also mitigate radiation dangers.

The required infrastructure must be constructed, but the mass and logistics of bringing all the
construction materials from Earth are prohibitive, which makes the necessary construction
difficult to achieve. In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) aims to solve this challenge by sourcing
construction materials locally or “in-situ”. This means that their transportation can be completely eliminated, resulting in large cost savings by avoiding the launch out of Earth’s deep gravity well and subsequent trans lunar injection, lunar orbit capture and landing.

This paper will give an overview of the required construction tasks and related equipment that
will be required to robotically build a lunar base using in-situ resources. It will also organize
these tasks into logical groupings so that technology development and implementation can be
pursued within a framework that can be referenced by all involved.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220000418,""endDate"":""2022-04-28T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""6457a6ab23c95056a4fd2df12a5908a5"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society of Civil Engineers"",""location"":""Reston, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""c202fdaf047448e999467a38c6429a4b"",""id"":""b8c2db1c43024592a5003877026ffe70""}],""name"":""ASCE Earth & Space Conference"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""c202fdaf047448e999467a38c6429a4b"",""url"":""https://learn.mines.edu/earthspace2022/"",""startDate"":""2022-04-25T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""SW00001""]",undefined,"[""Lunar And Planetary Science And Exploration""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220000418

Volume 1: Mission description, experiments K-7-01 - K-7-15","[""Connolly, James P."",""Grindeland, Richard E."",""Ballard, Rodney W.""]","Cosmos 2044 was launched on September 15, 1989, containing radiation dosimetry experiments and a biological payload including two young male rhesus monkeys, ten adult male Wistar rats, insects, amphibians, protozoa, cell cultures, worms, plants and fish. The biosatellite was launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the Soviet Union for a mission duration of 14 days, as planned. The major research objectives were: (1) Study adaptive response mechanisms of mammals during flight; (2) Study physiological mechanisms underlying vestibular, motor system and brain function in primates during early and later adaptation phases; (3) Study the tissue regeneration processes of mammals; (4) Study the development of single-celled organisms, cell cultures and embryos in microgravity; (5) Study radiation characteristics during the mission and investigate doses, fluxes and spectra of cosmic radiation for various types of shielding. American and Soviet specialists jointly conducted 29 experiments on this mission including extensive preflight and post flight studies with rhesus monkeys, and tissue processing and cell culturing post flight. Biosamples and data were subsequently transferred to the United States. The U.S. responsibilities for this flight included development of flight and ground-based hardware, the preparation of rat tissue sample procedures, the verification testing of hardware and experiment procedures, and the post flight analysis of biospecimens and data for the joint experiments. The U.S. investigations included four primate experiments, 24 rat experiments, and one radiation dosimetry experiment. Three scientists investigated tissue repair during flight for a subgroup of rats injured preflight by surgical intervention. A description of the Cosmos 2044 mission is presented in this report including preflight, on-orbit and post flight activities. The flight and ground-based bioinstrumentation which was developed by the U.S. and U.S.S.R. is also described, along with the associated preflight testing of the U.S. hardware.","[{""submissionId"":19950012154,""id"":""3813665d54c647fd83fb2d2216839c04"",""publicationDate"":""1994-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""RTOP 199-08-12""]",undefined,"[""Space Biology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19950012154
20205009095,POSTER,Spaceflight Biospecimen and Data Sharing in Support of Science Discovery and Exploration,"[""Ryan T. Scott"",""Alison J French"",""Alan E. Wood"",""Elizabeth Keller"",""Danielle Lopez"",""Martha Del Alto""]","For decades, NASA and international partners have conducted biological experiments in space to understand effects of spaceflight and address potential hazards. To enable spaceflight back to the Moon, and then to Mars and beyond, it is imperative to further understand basic science and health risks associated with spaceflight, along with developing countermeasures. The sending of experiments and organisms into space is a costly endeavor. To maximize scientific return, sharing with the scientific community both space-flown biospecimens and data from completed experiments is essential. New fundamental, applied, and bioinformatic science insights can be gained from specimen and data sharing efforts. Data reuse enables spaceflight health risk modeling, analyzing adverse outcomes across spaceflight hazards, and deep space autonomous support for the flight medical officer. 

Space-flown biospecimens not required by mission Principal Investigators are regularly archived and made available for scientific request. The largest biorepository of these samples are found within NASA’s Institutional Scientific Collection at Ames Research Center (ISC-ARC), which stores over 32,000 specimens mostly from Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) missions, but also some ground-based analog samples. The Ames Life Sciences Data Archive manages the ISC-ARC. Tissues are predominantly from mice and rats, though samples are also available from bacteria and quail. Only a handful of other similar collections exist worldwide. Rodent biospecimens exposed to simulated space radiation at Brookhaven National Laboratory are archived under the purview of NASA HRP Space Radiation Element. Microbial collection and analyses from 20 years of routine environmental monitoring of air, surfaces, and water systems of the ISS were performed to ensure a safe environment for astronauts. Samples from the ISC-ARC, space radiation and microbial collections are searchable and requestable through the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). Decades of planetary protection microbial isolates derived from spacecraft bioburden are archived in JPL’s microbial collection. Rodent biospecimens from spaceflight investigations conducted by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) are archived and available at the JAXA Biorepository at Tsukuba Space Center. The Russian Institute of Biomedical Problems also has a collection of animal, microbial, cellular, and fungi available for research from ground analog experiments. 

Several data repositories exist for scientists to utilize. The LSDA is the primary NASA source of life sciences research data and information. It contains decades of spaceflight and ground-analog research involving human, microbial, cellular, plant, and animal subjects. Data is collected from NASA-funded investigations through the Human Research Program and the Space Biology Program. The NASA Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health collects and grants access to clinical and occupational health monitoring data from astronauts, with a list and description of data collected available for request through the LSDA. NASA GeneLab at ARC collects genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from any species. It is a repository and platform for collaborative open-science bioinformatic approaches. JAXA is establishing an ‘omics-based repository in collaboration with the Tohoku Medical Megabank (ToMMo), called the JAXA-ToMMo Integrated Biobank for Space Life Science. Overall, the sharing of these biospecimen and data resources can assist researchers worldwide in understanding spaceflight effects on biology, along with enabling next generation data science applications for space exploration platforms.

Both in the anhydrous and hydrated solid states and as solid sodium or hydrochloride salts each enantiomer suffered significant radioracemization of the undestroyed residue during its partial radiolysis. The sodium salt of isovaline in 0.1-M aqueous solution suffered extensive radiolysis with relatively small radiation doses, but showed no detectable radioracemization. The significance of these observations with respect to the primordial enantiomeric composition of the isovaline (and other amino acids) indigenous to meteorites is discussed.","[{""volume"":""43"",""submissionId"":19800028848,""id"":""b3ad4b1650a04033a11aa881cc12d7df"",""publicationName"":""Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"",""publicationDate"":""1979-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Biology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19800028848

Using the well-studied cataract model, mice were exposed to plateau 600 MeV/amu Fe-56 ions either as acute or fractionated exposures at total doses of 5-504 cGy. Additional groups of mice received 20, 360 and 504 cGy behind 50 mm of polyethylene, which simulates body shielding. The reference radiation consisted of Co-60 gamma radiation. The animals were examined by slit lamp biomicroscopy over their three year life spans. In accordance with our previous observations with heavy particles, the cataractogenic potential of the 600 MeV/amu Fe-56 ions was greater than for low-Linear Energy Transfer (LET) radiation and increased with decreasing dose relative to gamma rays. Fractionation of a given dose of Fe-56 ions did not reduce the cataractogenicity of the radiation compared to the acute regimen. Fragmentation of the beam in the polyethylene did not alter the cataractotoxicity of the ions, either when administered singly or in fractions.","[{""volume"":""14"",""submissionId"":19940039074,""issue"":""10"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""876fa16f17ac445bb5c2f314be04bec9"",""publicationName"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1"",""publicationDate"":""1994-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""EY02648"",""W17,468"",""DOE-DE-FG02-90ER6009"",""NAG9-256-52"",""T5328R"",""FG02-88ER60631""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""},{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940039074

It has been suggested that the packaging of chromatin fibers in the interphase nucleus is closely related to genome function, and the changes in transcriptional activity are tightly correlated with changes in chromatin folding. This study explores the changes of chromatin conformation and chromatin-chromatin interactions in the simulated microgravity environment, and investigates their correlation to the expression of genes located at different regions of the chromosome. To investigate the folding of chromatin in interphase under various culture conditions, human epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes were fixed in the G1 phase. Interphase chromosomes were hybridized with a multicolor banding in situ hybridization (mBAND) probe for chromosome 3 which distinguishes six regions of the chromosome as separate colors. After images were captured with a laser scanning confocal microscope, the 3-dimensional structure of interphase chromosome 3 was reconstructed at multi-mega base pair scale. In order to determine the effects of microgravity on chromosome conformation and orientation, measures such as distance between homologous pairs, relative orientation of chromosome arms about a shared midpoint, and orientation of arms within individual chromosomes were all considered as potentially impacted by simulated microgravity conditions. The studies revealed non-random folding of chromatin in interphase, and suggested an association of interphase chromatin folding with radiation-induced chromosome aberration hotspots. Interestingly, the distributions of genes with expression changes over chromosome 3 in cells cultured under microgravity environment are apparently clustered on specific loci and chromosomes. This data provides important insights into how mammalian cells respond to microgravity at molecular level.","[{""submissionId"":20150021306,""id"":""96ccfe249ce549c790644c2566f5e3fd"",""publicationDate"":""2015-11-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150021306,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""location"":""Arlington, VA, United States"",""id"":""0db8e25b37174c2fb3db37f614e0ab65""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20150021306,""endDate"":""2015-11-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""location"":""Arlington, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""fb5e30ca2d2c4fbbb6bfce6dd1cb62af"",""id"":""3dc09281f7c1421d921e683b7db6b28d""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR 2015)"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA"",""id"":""fb5e30ca2d2c4fbbb6bfce6dd1cb62af"",""startDate"":""2015-11-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NAS9-02078""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150021306

Mueller""]","Previous lunar  missions  and  campaigns have  been restricted  to using  robotic  landers  and lunar orbiting satellites  as  well  as sortie  type  of  operations  using astronaut crews(NASA Apollo program).Now, the  next phase  of lunar  exploration  has  begun  under  NASA’s Artemis program and  there  has  been  an  international  response  where  other  nations  such  as  China,  Russia,  India, Canada,  Japan and theEuropean  Union  of  nations,  have all  expressed  interest  in either collaborating or competing with NASA on theMoon. This next phase has an overarching goal of achieving a permanent human presence on theMoon via sustainable methods.

A  lunar  base with human  occupancy will  require  infrastructure  to  provide  shelter,  utilities, landing/launch  pads,  roads,  communications,  power  and all  the  other  necessities  to sustain human  life  and  protect  equipment.Since  human biology  is  not  well  suited  for surviving  in the lunar environment,  there  will  be  many  forms  of automated  equipment,  autonomy  and  robotic helpers that  will  minimize  the  amount  of  Extra-Vehicular Activity(EVA)  required  by  the  crew. This will  mean  that the radiation  dosage  received by the crew  will  stay  within  acceptable and safe career doses. Radiation shielding via the use of regolith can also mitigate radiation dangers.The required infrastructure  must  be  constructed, but the mass  and  logistics  of bringing all the construction  materials  from  Earth  are  prohibitive, which  makes the necessary construction difficult to achieve.In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) aims to solve this challenge by sourcing construction materials locally or “in-situ”. This means that their transportation can be completely eliminated, resulting in large cost savings by avoiding the launch out of Earth’s deep gravity well and subsequent trans lunar injection, lunar orbit capture and landing.

This paper will give ahistorical review and current status of lunar construction planning and a high level introduction to the required infrastructure and construction equipment that will be required to robotically build a lunar base using in-situ resources.It will also organize these tasks into logical groupings so that technology development and implementation can be pursued within a framework that can be referenced by all involved.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220005192,""endDate"":""2022-04-28T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""6457a6ab23c95056a4fd2df12a5908a5"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society of Civil Engineers"",""location"":""Reston, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f74684ad5d994d15ad6f666d156edda5"",""id"":""464395d610dd4611a0ec52ad24d1b4f4""}],""name"":""American Society of Civil Engineers Earth & Space Conference 2022"",""location"":""Denver, Colorado"",""id"":""f74684ad5d994d15ad6f666d156edda5"",""url"":""https://learn.mines.edu/earthspace2022/"",""startDate"":""2022-04-25T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""SW000001""]",undefined,"[""Engineering (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220005192

The frequency of occurrence of white-yellow stripes on leaves of plants developed from irradiated maize seeds increased linearly with dose, and high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) heavy charged particles, e.g., neon, argon, and iron, were 2-12 times as effective as gamma rays in inducing this type of mutation. The effectiveness of high-LET heavy ion in (1) inhibiting rice seedling growth, (2) reducing plant fertility, (3) inducing chromosome aberration and micronuclei in root tip cells and pollen mother cells of the first generation plants developed from exposed seeds, and (4) inducing mutation in the second generation, were greater than that of low-LET gamma rays. All effects observed were dose-dependent; however, there appeared to be an optimal range of doses for inducing certain types of mutation, for example, for argon ions (400 MeV/u) at 90-100 Gy, several valuable mutant lines with favorable characters, such as semidwarf, early maturity and high yield ability, were obtained. Experimental results suggest that the potential application of heavy ions in crop improvement is promising. Restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of two semidwarf mutants induced by argon particles revealed that large DNA alterations might be involved in these mutants.","[{""volume"":""14"",""submissionId"":19940039061,""issue"":""10"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""bd29614ea69a4e23bb3ca3264b19b01b"",""publicationName"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1"",""publicationDate"":""1994-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""},{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940039061
20040112369,REPRINT,Relationship between radiation-induced aberrations in individual chromosomes and their DNA content: effects of interaction distance,"[""Wu, H."",""Durante, M."",""Lucas, J. N.""]","PURPOSE: To study the effect of the interaction distance on the frequency of inter- and intrachromosome exchanges in individual chromosomes with respect to their DNA content. Assumptions: Chromosome exchanges are formed by misrejoining of two DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) induced within an interaction distance, d. It is assumed that chromosomes in G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle occupy a spherical domain in a cell nucleus, with no spatial overlap between individual chromosome domains. RESULTS: Formulae are derived for the probability of formation of inter-, as well as intra-, chromosome exchanges relating to the DNA content of the chromosome for a given interaction distance. For interaction distances <1 microm, the relative frequency of interchromosome exchanges predicted by the present model is similar to that by Cigarran et al. (1998) based on the assumption that the probability of interchromosome exchanges is proportional to the ""surface area"" of the chromosome territory. The ""surface area"" assumption is shown to be a limiting case of d-->0 in the present model. The present model also predicts that the probability of intrachromosome exchanges occurring in individual chromosomes is proportional to their DNA content with correction terms. CONCLUSION: When the interaction distance is small, the ""surface area"" distribution for chromosome participation in interchromosome exchanges has been expected. However, the present model shows that for the interaction distance as large as 1 microm, the predicted probability of interchromosome exchange formation is still close to the surface area distribution. Therefore, this distribution does not necessarily rule out the formation of complex chromosomal aberrations by long-range misrejoining of DSB.","[{""volume"":""77"",""submissionId"":20040112369,""issue"":""7"",""issn"":""0955-3002"",""id"":""382605c20b474d4c9030c1a10268c22c"",""publicationName"":""International journal of radiation biology"",""publicationDate"":""2001-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040112369

These compounds coalesced in the upper atmosphere with particles ejected from craters formed by impacts of large objects. Coalescence during exposure to UV radiation concentrated organic monomers and enhanced formation of oligomers. Continuing coalescence added material to the growing particles and shielded prebiotic compounds from prolonged UV radiation. These particles settled into the lower atmosphere where they were scavenged by rain. Aqueous chemistry and evaporation of raindrops containing monomers in high temperature regions near the earth's surface also promoted continued formation of oligomers. Finally, these oligomers were deposited in the oceans where continued prebiotic evolution led to the most primitive cell. Results of present studies suggest that prebiotic chemical evolution may be an inevitable consequence of impacting comets during the late accretion of planets anywhere in the universe if oceans remained on those planetary surfaces.","[{""volume"":""19"",""submissionId"":19890064690,""issue"":""1, 19"",""issn"":""0169-6149"",""id"":""bf0ddafcd91b472684a3570a249e5fda"",""publicationName"":""Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere"",""publicationDate"":""1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Biology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19890064690

Therefore, reusing and reanalyzing legacy experiments is one way that scientists can draw new conclusions in a timely manner and without using too many resources. Moreover, advances in general biological knowledge allows legacy experiments to be placed into more complete context.Here we aim to analyze all data and metadata taken from rats flown on the SLS-1 mission to create a comprehensive biological model that can be supplemented with current data to allow new discoveries in how space flown organisms adapt to the space environment. Our approach begins with the identification of all the data and metadata, including graphs and tables, for SLS-1 in NASA archives and other sources. Then, each piece of data and metadata will be digitized, reformatted and analyzed. Lastly, a previously developed astronaut model will be used to create the data framework and a comprehensive biological rodent model. The datasets we are using is from the 1991 SpaceLab Life Science 1 (SLS-1) NASA Mission. This was the first designated spacelab mission flown. All 29 rodents were tested for nine days in two different habitats: Research Animal Holding Facility (RAHF) and Animal Enclosure Module (AEM). The rodents were prepared for a live return and compared to a ground control. A total of 30 rodent experiments were accepted as flight studies on the mission.

DSB clustering at large scales, from >100 Mbp down to approximately 2 kbp, is modeled using a Monte-Carlo algorithm. A random-walk model of chromatin is combined with a track model, that predicts the radial distribution of energy from an ion, and the RLC (randomly-located-clusters) formalism, in software called DNAbreak. This model generalizes the random-breakage model, whose broken-stick fragment-size distribution is applicable to low-LET radiation. DSB induction due to track interaction with the DNA volume depends on the radiation quality parameter Q. This dose-independent parameter depends only weakly on LET. Multi-track, high-dose effects depend on the cluster intensity parameter lambda, proportional to fluence as defined by the RLC formalism. After lambda is determined by a numerical experiment, the model reduces to one adjustable parameter Q. The best numerical fits to the experimental data, determining Q, are obtained. The knowledge of lambda and Q allows us to give biophysically based extrapolations of high-dose DNA fragment-size data to low doses or to high LETs.","[{""volume"":""17 Suppl 1"",""submissionId"":20040088553,""issn"":""1120-1797"",""id"":""e6c9846c3c04483098f0185033d46dad"",""publicationName"":""Physica medica :  PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""GM 57245"",""ES-07361"",""CA-49062"",""CA-24232"",""CA-77285"",""FG02-98ER62686"",""RR-11623""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088553
20250001714,REPRINT,Obliquity Dependence of Ocean Productivity and Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> on Earth-like Worlds,"[""Paul Lerner"",""Anastasia Romanou"",""Michael Way"",""Christopher Colose""]","Obliquity can shape the habitability of a planet by changing the seasonal availability of incident solar radiation. Changes in incident radiation can lead to changes in the availability of light, temperature, ocean circulation, stratification, and corresponding nutrient availability, all of which are important in determining ocean net primary productivity (NPP). Moreover, a fraction of the carbon assimilated by phytoplankton is sequestered in the deep ocean. Therefore, changes in productivity can alter the distribution of CO<sub>2</sub> between the ocean and atmosphere. In this study, we investigate the effects of obliquity on ocean NPP and the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration using ROCKE-3D fully coupled to the NASA GISS Ocean Biogeochemistry Model. We find sea surface temperature primarily controls the NPP response, with both properties reaching a maximum at an obliquity of 45°. We find that the response of the seasonal amplitude of NPP to obliquity is controlled primarily by photosynthetically available radiation and secondarily by changes in nutrient availability. We also find that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increases in response to obliquity, with a minimum at 15° and a maximum at 60°. The obliquity-driven CO<sub>2</sub> changes are controlled primarily by temperature-driven solubility changes, with circulation and biology either enhancing solubility-driven changes at low obliquities or acting against and partially offsetting solubility-driven changes at higher obliquities. The magnitude of obliquity-driven changes is likely too small to be detectable, though future studies are needed to determine whether changing obliquity simultaneously with other orbital parameters can lead to larger, potentially detectable changes in NPP and CO<sub>2</sub>.","[{""volume"":""979"",""submissionId"":20250001714,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0004-637X"",""publisher"":""IOP Publishing"",""eissn"":""1538-4357"",""id"":""5c46721409bf48bb8629d0546329d0e3"",""publicationName"":""The Astrophysical Journal"",""publicationDate"":""2025-01-29T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""issuePublicationDate"":""2025-01-29T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""doi"":""10.3847/1538-4357/ada277""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""80NSSC22M0054"",""80GSFC23CA041"",""811073.02.55.01.20"",""811073.02.52.01.08.84"",""811073.02.35.08.59""]",undefined,"[""Lunar and Planetary Science and Exploration""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250001714

M."",""Durante, M."",""Mei, M.""]","On Moon and Mars, there will be more galactic cosmic rays and higher radiation doses than on Earth. Our experimental studies showed that heavy ion radiation can effectively cause mutation and chromosome aberrations and that high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) heavy-ion induced mutants can be irreversible. Chromosome translocations and deletions are common in cells irradiated by heavy particles, and ionizing radiations are effective in causing hyperploidy. The importance of the genetic changes in the evolution of life is an interesting question. Through evolution, there is an increase of DNA content in cells from lower forms of life to higher organisms. The DNA content, however, reached a plateau in vertebrates. By increasing DNA content, there can be an increase of information in the cell. For a given DNA content, the quality of information can be changed by rearranging the DNA. Because radiation can cause hyperploidy, an increase of DNA content in cells, and can induce DNA rearrangement, it is likely that the evolution of life on Mars will be effected by its radiation environment. A simple analysis shows that the radiation level on Mars may cause a mutation frequency comparable to that of the spontaneous mutation rate on Earth. To the extent that mutation plays a role in adaptation, radiation alone on Mars may thus provide sufficient mutation for the evolution of life.","[{""volume"":""14"",""submissionId"":19940039062,""issue"":""10"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""ea26a49bf5d14eb2896ec595d975c050"",""publicationName"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1"",""publicationDate"":""1994-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""T9297R""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""},{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940039062

Trained as a biologist, I landed my first job at NASA as a mission scientist on the Rodent Research project. As a mission scientist, I led science activities associated with development, flight, and post-flight analysis of rodent research missions on the ISS in consultation with project engineers, operational specialists, mission PI(s), and mission Implementation Partner(s). I also assessed the feasibility of scientific experiments as a technical and scientific expert in rodent research on the ISS. Eager to learn more about the molecular changes that occur as a result of spaceflight exposure, I transitioned to the NASA GeneLab project where I eventually became the data processing lead. NASA’s GeneLab helps scientists understand how the fundamental building blocks of life – DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites – change from exposure to the space environment including microgravity and cosmic radiation exposure. GeneLab does so by providing fully coordinated epigenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data (collectively known as omics data) alongside essential metadata describing each spaceflight and space-relevant experiment. To maximize the intelligibility of these data, particularly for users with limited bioinformatics knowledge, GeneLab has started processing and analyzing these datasets to generate differential gene expression data and identify biological and physiological pathways that are dysregulated as a result of spaceflight. The user interface was designed to be accessible to a broad variety of users, including high school and college students who can use it to learn about omics data analysis and space biology.

20040141840,REPRINT,Preparing for Mars: the physiologic and medical challenges,"[""Buckey, J. C. Jr""]","As the twentieth century closes, retrospectives cite the Apollo moon missions as one of the important events of the past 100 years. A trip to Mars, however, would be even more challenging and significant. A round-trip Mars journey would require nearly three years away from Earth, a significant leap in complexity compared to the two week long Moon trips or the record-breaking fourteen-month flight on Mir. What would be the physiologic and medical challenges of a Mars flight? Two key areas of physiology present the greatest potential problems--calcium metabolism and radiation exposure. Data from Mir missions show that bone loss continues in space despite an aggressive countermeasure program. Average losses were 0.35% per month, but some load bearing areas lost >1% per month. A 1% loss rate, if it continued unabated for 30 months, could produce osteoporosis. Smaller losses could still increase fracture risk. Some bone loss can be well tolerated, particularly if the bone can be regained after the mission. But the effectiveness of post-flight rehabilitation to restore the density and quality of bone after spaceflight is not well known. Bone loss estimates are based on continuous weightlessness exposure, but this is not a requirement for a Mars trip. Most of the time on a Mars trip will be spent in the 1/3 Earth's gravity environment on Mars, and either intermittent or continuous artificial gravity can be provided for the transit between planets (although at an engineering cost). The dosing of the gravity exposure (e.g. the level and duration), however, has not been established. Radiation protection also requires a balance between engineering cost and human health. Excessive shielding could add billions of dollars to the cost of a mission. Trips in interplanetary space, however, expose the crew to heavy high-energy particles from cosmic rays (HZE particles), which have a high linear energy transfer. This high energy leads to significant biological damage (e.g. chromosomal aberrations, cancer induction). A recent report from the Committee on Space Biology and Medicine notes that only one systematic study of cancer induction from high-energy particles has been conducted (using the mouse Harderian gland). Predictions of cancer risk and acceptable radiation exposure in space are extrapolated from minimal data. Other areas of physiology also present problems, such as muscle loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, and vestibular adaptation. Despite all the issues, however, a focussed, aggressive research program that uses the resources of the International Space Station should pave the way for mankind's greatest adventure--a trip to Mars.","[{""volume"":""4"",""submissionId"":20040141840,""issue"":""9"",""issn"":""0949-2321"",""id"":""2803585bf3564dc7a68a7369ab370031"",""publicationName"":""European journal of medical research"",""publicationDate"":""1999-09-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Lunar And Planetary Science And Exploration""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040141840
20040173061,REPRINT,Human life support for advanced space exploration,"[""Schwartzkopf, S. H.""]","The requirements for a human life support system for long-duration space missions are reviewed. The system design of a controlled ecological life support system is briefly described, followed by a more detailed account of the study of the conceptual design of a Lunar Based CELSS. The latter is to provide a safe, reliable, recycling lunar base life support system based on a hybrid physicochemical/biological representative technology. The most important conclusion reached by this study is that implementation of a completely recycling CELSS approach for a lunar base is not only feasible, but eminently practical. On a cumulative launch mass basis, a 4-person Lunar Base CELSS would pay for itself in approximately 2.6 years relative to a physicochemical air/water recycling system with resupply of food from the Earth. For crew sizes of 30 and 100, the breakeven point would come even sooner, after 2.1 and 1.7 years, respectively, due to the increased mass savings that can be realized with the larger plant growth units. Two other conclusions are particularly important with regard to the orientation of future research and technology development. First, the mass estimates of the Lunar Base CELSS indicate that a primary design objective in implementing this kind of system must be to minimized the mass and power requirement of the food production plant growth units, which greatly surpass those of the other air and water recycling systems. Consequently, substantial research must be directed at identifying ways to produce food more efficiently. On the other hand, detailed studies to identify the best technology options for the other subsystems should not be expected to produce dramatic reductions in either mass or power requirement of a Lunar Base CELSS. The most crucial evaluation criterion must, therefore, be the capability for functional integration of these technologies into the ultimate design of the system. Secondly, this study illustrates that existing or near-term technologies are adequate to implement a Lunar Base CELSS. There are no apparent ""show-stoppers"" which require the development of new technologies. However, there are several areas in which new materials and technologies could be used for a more efficient implementation of the system, e.g., by decreasing mass or power requirement and increasing recycling efficiency. These areas must be further addressed through research and development. Finally, although this study focused on the development of a Lunar Base CELSS, the same technologies and a nearly identical design would be appropriate for a Mars base. Actually, except for the distance of transportation, the implementation of a CELSS on Mars would even be easier than it would be on the Moon. The presence of atmospheric CO2 on Mars, although in low concentration, coupled with the fact that the day/night cycle on Mars is very similar to that on Earth, makes the use of light-weight, greenhouse-like structures for growing food plants even more feasible than on the Moon. There are some environmental problems, which would have to be dealt with, like dust storms and the large amount of the ultraviolet radiation incident on the planet's surface. However, the materials and methods are largely available today to develop such a life support system for a Mars base.","[{""volume"":""6"",""submissionId"":20040173061,""issn"":""1569-2574"",""id"":""e1dd32c4c9ed4b629c59233bb016cedd"",""publicationName"":""Advances in space biology and medicine"",""publicationDate"":""1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040173061

20110020659,ABSTRACT,Effects and Responses to Spaceflight in the Mouse Retina,"[""Zanello, Susana B."",""Theriot, Corey"",""Westby, Christian"",""Boyle, Richard""]","Several stress environmental factors are combined in a unique fashion during spaceflight, affecting living beings widely across their physiological systems. Recently, attention has been placed on vision changes in astronauts returning from long duration missions. Alterations include hyperoptic shift, globe flattening, choroidal folds and optic disc edema, which are probably associated with increased intracranial pressure. These observations justify a better characterization of the ocular health risks associated with spaceflight. This study investigates the impact of spaceflight on the biology of the mouse retina. Within a successful tissue sharing effort, eyes from albino Balb/cJ mice aboard STS-133 were collected for histological analysis and gene expression profiling of the retina at 1 and 7 days after landing. Both vivarium and AEM (Animal Enclosure Module) mice were used as ground controls. Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage was higher in the flight samples compared to controls on R+1, and decreased on R+7. A trend toward higher oxidative and cellular stress response gene expression was also observed on R+1 compared to AEM controls, and these levels decreased on R+7. Several genes coding for key antioxidant enzymes, namely, heme-oxygenase-1, peroxiredoxin, and catalase, were among those upregulated after flight. Likewise, NF B and TGFbeta1, were upregulated in one flight specimen that overall showed the most elevated oxidative stress markers on R+1. In addition, retinas from vivarium control mice evidenced higher oxidative stress markers, NF B and TGFbeta1, likely due to the more intense illumination in vivarium cages versus the AEM. These preliminary data suggest that spaceflight represents a source of environmental stress that translates into oxidative and cellular stress in the retina, which is partially reversible upon return to Earth. Further work is needed to dissect the contribution of the various spaceflight factors (microgravity, radiation) and to evaluate the impact of the stress response on retinal health.","[{""submissionId"":20110020659,""id"":""1e1f1eaf47814ccabe82f27668434531"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20110020659,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""e256c04025e641db983ccaa022320608""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110020659,""endDate"":""2012-02-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""8ccaff322ecb48d2811364bf91d9f59d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Wyle Labs., Inc."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""a15a77c5d85840478b3c59c5458f392b"",""id"":""c1c311916f9842bda005a0f8c01bbd74""},{""organizationId"":""e93b3291b52a413fadbfa948e4fe2d71"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""a15a77c5d85840478b3c59c5458f392b"",""id"":""a61394f716b3424bb8b78a2d7ad8dca7""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""a15a77c5d85840478b3c59c5458f392b"",""id"":""bafd257bf686410ea71fb5f9256bffa1""}],""name"":""HRP Investigator''s Workshop 2012"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""a15a77c5d85840478b3c59c5458f392b"",""startDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110020659

This new approach involves mining multiple datasets at once from various hierarchical organizations of biological complexity, while concurrently evaluating how experimental factors affect endpoints of standard assays. The purpose of the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) is to collect, curate, and make findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) all non-human space-relevant biological data. These data include mission metadata, subject metadata, assay metadata (parameters), raw and processed assay data, assay imagery, and subject-experienced telemetry (radiation, temperature, humidity, acoustics, vibrations). ALSDA has transformed to bring current biological repository data and all future collected data into this new scientific data mining reality. It has integrated into the ‘NASA Open Science’ group of projects to facilitate a suite of new tools and workflows to improve data accessibility and reusability by implementing data management plans, automating data submission agreements, and adopting the single-point-of-entry data submission portal, originally developed by NASA GeneLab. These systems required ALSDA to develop science assay configurations for the submission portal, capturing essential assay parameters according to established norms in each sub-field within biology. The submission portal expedites data collection by enhancing ease of PI data submission, providing a user interface and specificity for which data is to be submitted.

20205011578,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Chemical Reactivity of In-Situ Lunar Dust for Biotoxicity Assessment,"[""Jon C Rask"",""Penelope J Boston""]","How does the chemical reactivity of in-situ lunar dust compare to Apollo samples currently stored in curation facilities here on Earth? Essential investigations of this question will help us to further mitigate exploration risks for future human explorers on the Moon and will also provide critical information for astrobiologists and space biologists using the Moon for scientific inquiry.

Apollo 14 dust biotoxicity studies, carried out by the NASA Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Assessment Group (LADTAG), included numerous cellular and animal experiments. Intratracheal instillation and inhalation studies in rats both showed Apollo 14 dust to be intermediate in toxicity compared to low-tox titanium dusts and high-tox quartz dusts of similar particle sizes. The collective results were used in models to establish a safe exposure limit for astronauts. Although LADTAG took extensive steps to preserve what chemical reactivity may still have existed in the samples, it is simply unknown if they possessed true in-situ chemical reactivity or if that reactivity has decayed. Initial gas loss on collection and other alterations, and even intermittent exposure to Earth-normal conditions during subsequent decades of handling, obscure a forensic reconstruction of the initial state.

Because a mineral dust’s chemical reactivity influences its biotoxicity, researchers have developed methods to “activate” lunar dust and simulants. Past studies that modeled impact processes and radiation in the lunar environment suggest that in-situ lunar dust is likely to be more chemically reactive than Earth-exposed samples. Because of these results, in-situ measurements are warranted. Since the lunar surface is heterogeneous, dust biotoxicity is expected to vary from site to site due to particle size, mineralogy, physical characteristics, degree of space weathering, and chemical reactivity. This circumstance dictates dust assessments at a suite of lunar sites enabled by CLPS opportunities.

Dose, location, and duration of particle exposure will also affect biological responses. In-situ chemical reactivity measurements can inform cross-cutting collaborative research campaigns such as astrobiology studies examining regolith interactions with organisms and its ability to preserve chemical and structural biomarkers, as well as space biology investigations that examine regolith-microbe interactions relating to life support systems, plant growth, biomining, and development of regolith biocomposites.

20210022863,PRESENTATION,Working at NASA as a (Molecular) Biologist...,"[""Amanda M Saravia-Butler""]","Trained as a biologist, I landed my first job at NASA as a mission scientist on the Rodent Research project. As a mission scientist, I led science activities associated with development, flight, and post-flight analysis of rodent research missions on the ISS in consultation with project engineers, operational specialists, mission PI(s), and mission Implementation Partner(s). I also assessed the feasibility of scientific experiments as a technical and scientific expert in rodent research on the ISS. Eager to learn more about the molecular changes that occur as a result of spaceflight exposure, I transitioned to the NASA GeneLab project where I eventually became the data processing lead. NASA’s GeneLab helps scientists understand how the fundamental building blocks of life – DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites – change from exposure to the space environment including microgravity and cosmic radiation exposure. GeneLab does so by providing fully coordinated epigenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data (collectively known as omics data) alongside essential metadata describing each spaceflight and space-relevant experiment. In order to maximize the intelligibility of these data, particularly for users with limited bioinformatics knowledge, GeneLab has started processing and analyzing these datasets to generate differential gene expression data and identify biological and physiological pathways that are dysregulated as a result of spaceflight. The user interface was designed to be accessible to a broad variety of users, including high school and college students who can use it to learn about omics data analysis and space biology. During the CA Space Grant NASA Panel event, I will provide an overview of my work at NASA on both the Rodent Research and GeneLab projects and will conclude by providing resources for opportunities to work with GeneLab and NASA at large.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20210022863,""endDate"":""2021-10-19T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""ac4f7a96ca1c5757afab587df766619c"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""California Space Grant Consortium"",""location"":""La Jolla, California, United States""}},""meetingId"":""4294b52a0bec42499eb9d0b130ce28a8"",""id"":""238c4915ba0a420fb3ec3a4927e1c2db""}],""name"":""CA Space Grant University of Redlands NASA Panel"",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""4294b52a0bec42499eb9d0b130ce28a8"",""startDate"":""2021-10-19T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""904211.04.01.30.58""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210022863

The goal of this project is to quantitatively summarize the data on the effects of actual or simulated microgravity and radiation exposure resulting from spaceflight on the cardiovascular system. As the first step, a group of investigators approached through a collaboration of the Ames Life Science Data Archive (ALSDA) Analysis Working Group developed a list of relevant cardiovascular search terms. Based on these, medical librarians generated and executed the search strategy in Medline, CINAHL, Embase and NASA repositories. In parallel, we recruited students and young professionals from various space industry-affiliated organizations, resulting in ~100 individuals joining. With this program we aimed to reach students and young people underrepresented in STEM, including first-generation, female, minorities, disadvantaged backgrounds, fostered individuals, etc. These individuals completed a virtual training course on the nature and methodologies of the project. Following this, the participants were structured into teams with more senior/experienced individuals designated as team leaders. Currently, the teams are screening approximately 15,000 studies using the systematic review tool, Covidence. Teams will be extracting and curating data for meta-analysis of the cardiovascular spaceflight literature, but also extracting, submitting, and curating appropriate datasets into the new ALSDA submission portal and repository. This effort will result in collaborative publications based upon the literature meta-analyses, and a number of publicly accessible datasets for reuse, modeling, machine learning, and knowledge graph-type approaches. This approach reduces the length of time to complete title/abstract screening time from 1-2 years needed for this volume of studies, to 3-4 months, while also providing a unique, open-access educational experience to space research and training in knowledge synthesis tools to interested individuals.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220014871,""endDate"":""2023-02-09T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d57d9cf4968447c1be9d7aeb7b6723fc"",""id"":""3d41528a4b8e4892a31dd18a6f359e62""}],""name"":""2023 Human Research Program (HRP) Investigators' Workshop (IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""d57d9cf4968447c1be9d7aeb7b6723fc"",""url"":""https://www.cvent.com/c/abstracts/6c66b149-d763-4180-aed9-784f2773e5be"",""startDate"":""2023-02-07T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Documentation And Information Science"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220014871
20180002834,PRESENTATION,Aging and Spaceflight: Catalase Targeted to Mitochondria Alters Skeletal Structure and Responses to Musculoskeletal Disuse,"[""Globus, Ruth K."",""Tahimic, Candice"",""Schreurs, Ann-Sofie""]","Microgravity and ionizing radiation in the spaceflight environment pose multiple challenges to homeostasis and may contribute to cellular stress. Effects may include increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and repair error, cell cycle arrest, cell senescence or death. Our central hypothesis is that prolonged exposure to the spaceflight environment leads to excess production of ROS and oxidative damage, culminating in accelerated tissue degeneration which resembles aging. The main goal of this project is to determine the importance of cellular redox defense for physiological adaptations and tissue degeneration in the space environment. To accomplish this, we will use both wildtype (WT) mice and a well-established, genetically-engineered animal model (mCAT mice) which displays extended lifespan (Schriner et al. 2005). The animal model selected to test these ideas is engineered to quench ROS in mitochondria by targeted over-expression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondrial matrix. We showed previously that mCAT mice express the catalase transgene in skeletal tissues, bone forming osteoblasts, and bone resorbing osteoclasts. In addition, mCAT mice also display increased catalase activity in bone. Our findings revealed that exposure of adult, male, C57Bl/6J mice to simulated spaceflight (hindlimb unloading and gamma radiation) led to an increase in markers of oxidative damage (malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenol) in skeletal tissue of WT mice but not mCAT mice. To extend our hypothesis to other, spaceflight-relevant tissues, we are performing a ground-based study simulating 30 days of spaceflight by hindlimb unloading to determine potential protective effects of mitochondrial catalase activity on aging of multiple tissues (cardiovascular, nervous and skeletal).","[{""submissionId"":20180002834,""id"":""1a6df8edbfb04e3a88fafd5af169fe2b"",""publicationDate"":""2018-04-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180002834,""endDate"":""2018-04-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""04ee57f20269499cba4d77852aab9d5e"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Association of Anatomists"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""55cc115bf8bd42f3a512dceeaf47e5a0"",""id"":""e9223b34f3294effaaf92c8212c9306c""},{""organizationId"":""2d5413f506e14d63bc85f9b5b306736f"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Investigative Pathology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""55cc115bf8bd42f3a512dceeaf47e5a0"",""id"":""f4d876d221ec405fa5df044d941442c6""},{""organizationId"":""6a41b64a8e104f7a9a2a978fc947fd65"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"",""location"":""Rockville, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""55cc115bf8bd42f3a512dceeaf47e5a0"",""id"":""41bd3d59ee8d4604b70806d7e27261d4""},{""organizationId"":""b9bec8f34c0141419a883e78af6ba343"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""55cc115bf8bd42f3a512dceeaf47e5a0"",""id"":""84d60b6e49514f15b95c0f26f51cd6a9""},{""organizationId"":""d649e8c960e94547a434cc482de8953b"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Physiological Society"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""55cc115bf8bd42f3a512dceeaf47e5a0"",""id"":""ac728ac02c76463d85f228bb07278d9e""}],""name"":""Experimental Biology Conference"",""location"":""San Diego, CA"",""id"":""55cc115bf8bd42f3a512dceeaf47e5a0"",""startDate"":""2018-04-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C"",""NSBRI-NCC9-58-MA02501"",""NNH14ZTT001N"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180002834

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole blood was irradiated in vitro with a low and a high dose of 1 GeV u(-1) iron particles, 400MeV u(-1) neon particles or y-rays. Lymphocytes were cultured and metaphase cells were collected at different time points after 48-84h in culture. Interphase chromosomes were prematurely condensed using calyculin-A, either 48 or 72 h after exposure to iron particles or gamma-rays. Cells in first division were analysed using a combination of FISH whole-chromosome painting and DAPI/ Hoechst 33258 harlequin staining. RESULTS: There was a delay in expression of chromosome damage in metaphase that was LET- and dose-dependant. This delay was mostly related to the late emergence of complex-type damage into metaphase. Yields of damage in PCC collected 48 h after irradiation with iron particles were similar to values obtained from cells undergoing mitosis after prolonged incubation. CONCLUSION: The yield of high-LET radiation-induced complex chromosome damage could be underestimated when analysing metaphase cells collected at one time point after irradiation. Chemically induced PCC is a more accurate technique since problems with complicated cell-cycle delays are avoided.","[{""volume"":""77"",""submissionId"":20040112535,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0955-3002"",""id"":""0d065d4a74d545f5b2719dccd5bcffcc"",""publicationName"":""International journal of radiation biology"",""publicationDate"":""2001-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040112535

The influences of different wind speeds and organism size and resistivity are also studied. The temperature of organisms in mats less than a few millimeters thick will not differ from the ground temperature by more than 10 K. Water loss is actually retarded at higher wind speeds, since the organism temperature is lowered, thus reducing the saturation vapor pressure.

In this study the stability of several organic substances and a sample of the Murchison meteorite was tested under simulated Martian conditions. After adsorption on powdered quartz, samples of adenine, glycine and naphthalene were irradiated with UV light at various oxygen concentrations and exposure times. In the absence of oxygen, adenine and glycine appeared stable over the given irradiation period, whereas a definite loss was observed in the case of naphthalene, as well as in the volatilizable and pyrolizable content of the Murchison meteorite. The presence of oxygen during UV exposure caused a significant increase in the degradation rate of all samples.

20210016797,PRESENTATION,Mitochondria Dysfunction Central in Driving Health Risks Associated with Spaceflight,"[""Afshin Beheshti""]","Background: 
Determining the biological impact of spaceflight through novel approaches is essential to reduce the health risks to astronauts for long-term space missions. The current established health risks due to spaceflight are only reflecting known symptomatic and physiologic responses and do not reflect early onset of other potential diseases. There are many unknown variables which still need to be identified to fully understand the health impacts due to the environmental factors in space. 

Materials and Methods: 
One method to uncover potential novel biological mechanisms responsible for health risks in astronauts is by utilizing NASA’s GeneLab platform (genelab.nasa.gov). GeneLab is public repository that hosts multiple omics datasets generated from space biology experiments that include experiments flown in space, simulated cosmic radiation experiments, and simulated microgravity experiments. This presentation will provide an example of analysis and novel hypothesis generation that is being produced with GeneLab datasets. A comprehensive multi-omics approach was implemented correlating transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and methylation analysis. 

Results: 
We found that cells have stronger overall biological response than the tissues to spaceflight, with mitochondrial activity and innate immunity pathways being heavily impacted. NASA Twin Study results are consistent with a specific alteration in mitochondrial ATP production. Our results indicate that the space environment can directly induce mitochondrial damage, with mitochondrial dysfunctions being a cause for chronic inflammation and both being involved in the development of metabolic disorders that cause changes in lipid metabolism. We also found biological changes occurring during spaceflight with cell cycle, circadian rhythm and olfactory activity pathways can also influence and be influenced by alterations on mitochondrial activity",[],"[{""country"":""PT"",""submissionId"":20210016797,""endDate"":""2021-06-11T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""European Society for Clinical Investigation""}},""meetingId"":""66ffb2ddcd654e53814cbc3e1334cec7"",""id"":""20ec682160a346ffb5b94140d6d039a1""}],""name"":""European Society for Clinical Investigation (ESCI) Virtual Meeting "",""location"":""Virtual"",""id"":""66ffb2ddcd654e53814cbc3e1334cec7"",""url"":""https://esci.eu.com/registration-esci-2021/"",""startDate"":""2021-06-09T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210016797

Yet, it is suggested that early Earth and early Mars were similar enought that life may have evoled on Mars. If life did evolve on Mars, what evidence for its existence might we find? What constitutes a Martian paleobiomarker, and how can we distinguish such a marker from abiotically produced substances? The topics studied to answer this question include carbon and nitrogen cycling, as well as the stability and relative abundance of their intermediates in microbially dominated ecosystems.

Labeled release experiments were conducted in the LR Test Standards Module which replicates the Viking flight instrument configuration on analog Martian soils prepared to match the Viking inorganic analysis of Mars surface material to which an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide had been added. Getter experiments were also conducted to compare several reactions simultaneously in the presence and absence of UV radiation prior to the addition of nutrient. Hydrogen peroxide on certain analog soils is found to be capable of reproducing the kinetics and thermal information contained in the Mars data. The peroxide concentration necessary for this response, however, is shown to require a chemical stability or production rate much greater than seems likely in the Mars environment.

L-leucine and a DL-leucine mixture deposited on samples of 1-quartz and an amorphous silica preparation (Syloid 63) was subjected to Co-60 gamma-ray irradiation, then analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the radiolysis and racemization rates. The quartz surface is found to have a marginal efficacy in enhancing radiolysis when compared with a crystalline L-leucine control, although enhancing radioracemization symmetrically by a factor of two. Both the radiolysis and radioracemization of L-leucine and DL-leucine on a Syloid-63 silica surface are observed to increase with increasing radiation dose, and to be substantially greater than in the crystalline controls. Additional experiments with the nonprotein amino acid isovaline deposited on Syloid 63 confirm the greater radiolysis susceptibility of amino acids deposited on silica with respect to the crystalline state, although racemization is not observed.

This bone loss is attributed to increased activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and functional changes in bone-forming osteoblasts, cells that give rise to mature osteocytes. Our long-term goal is to identify signaling pathways that may be targeted to mitigate bone loss in scenarios of space exploration, radiotherapy and accidental radiation exposure. We have previously shown that exposure of MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cells to simulated space radiation (56Fe) increased the expression of the pro-osteoclastogenic gene rankl and decreased protein levels of LC3B-II, a key player in autophagy. In this current study, we aimed to further elucidate the role of autophagy in maintaining structural integrity of the skeleton. We hypothesize that loss of autophagy in bone leads to an imbalance in pro-osteoclastogenic and pro-osteogenic signals, resulting in net bone loss. To test our hypothesis we performed global postnatal deletion of Atg12 using tamoxifeninducible Cre recombinase under the control of the CAG promoter. Six-week-old CAGCreERT2/ FloxAtg12 animals were treated daily with Tamoxifen or Vehicle (Control, oil only) for five days and euthanasia performed two weeks after the onset of treatment. Percent change in body weights (prior to treatment and at euthanasia) was not significantly different between treatment groups within the same gender. Compared to Vehicle (Control) groups, Tamoxifen (Atg12 iKO) groups showed decreased LC3B-I to II conversion and increased p62 protein levels, consistent with loss of autophagy. Quantitative PCR revealed increased expression of proosteoclastogenic cytokines mcp1 and rankl in bone and marrow respectively in male iKOs compared to male controls. Expression levels of these genes were not significantly altered in the Atg12 iKO females compared to females controls. Microcomputed tomography of tibiae revealed decreased cortical bone volume, cortical thickness and periosteal perimeter consistent with bone loss; and a longer primary spongiosa in male Atg12 iKOs display compared to male controls. These decrements were less pronounced in the female Atg12 iKOs. Cancellous bone structure was not significantly different between iKOs and controls in both genders. Histological analysis also revealed that compared to male controls, male iKOs showed a profound increase in chondrocyte column length of the growth plate with hyper-expansion of both proliferating and hypertrophic zones.

The purpose of this study was to compare responses with modelled reduced gravity of space station, water system bacterial isolates with other isolates of the same species. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacterial isolates, Stenotrophomonas paucimobilis and Acinetobacter radioresistens, originally recovered from the water supply aboard the International Space Station (ISS) were grown in nutrient broth under modelled reduced gravity. Their growth was compared with type strains S. paucimobilis ATCC 10829 and A. radioresistens ATCC 49000. Acinetobacter radioresistens ATCC 49000 and the two ISS isolates showed similar growth profiles under modelled reduced gravity compared with normal gravity, whereas S. paucimobilis ATCC 10829 was negatively affected by modelled reduced gravity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that microgravity might have selected for bacteria that were able to thrive under this unusual condition. These responses, coupled with impacts of other features (such as radiation resistance and ability to persist under very oligotrophic conditions), may contribute to the success of these water system bacteria.

A."",""Chen, X."",""Kelly, C. P."",""Reinecker, H. C.""]","Challenges to successful space exploration and colonization include adverse physiological reactions to micro gravity and space radiation factors. Constant remodeling of the microvasculature is critical for tissue preservation, wound healing, and recovery after ischemia. Regulation of the vascular system in the intestine is particularly important to enable nutrient absorption while maintaining barrier function and mucosal defense against micro biota. Although tremendous progress has been made in understanding the molecular circuits regulating neovascularization, our knowledge of the adaptations of the vascular system to environmental challenges in the intestine remains incomplete. This is in part because of the lack of methods to observe and quantify the complex processes associated with vascular responses in vivo. Developed by GRC as a mature beta version, pre-release research software, VESsel GENeration Analysis (VESGEN) maps and quantifies the fractal-based complexity of vascular branching for novel insights into the cytokine, transgenic and therapeutic regulation of angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and microvascular remodeling. Here we demonstrate that VESGEN can be used to characterize the dynamic vascular responses to acute intestinal inflammation and mucosal recovery from in vivo confocal microscopic 3D image series. We induced transient intestinal inflammation in mice by DSS treatment and investigated whether the ability of the pro biotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb) to protect against intestinal inflammation was due to regulation of vascular remodeling. A primary characteristic of inflammation is excessive neovascularization (angiogenesis) resulting in fragile vessels prone to bleeding. Morphological parameters for triplicate specimens revealed that Sb treatment greatly reduced the inflammatory response of vascular networks by an average of 78%. This resulted from Sb inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling, a major angiogenesis signaling pathway. It needs to be determined whether pro biotic yeast represents a promising approach to GI protection in space. GRC performed only the VESGEN post-testing analysis.

It was found that organic structures can also be formed under anoxic conditions (N2, CO3=, H2O) by protracted longwavelength UV radiation. Apparently these structures form initially as organic layers upon CaCO3 crystalloids. The question remains as to whether the UV photosynthetic ability of such phase bounded structures is a curiosity, or a general property of phase bounded systems which is of direct interest to the emergence of cellular life. The question of the requirement and sailient features of a phase boundary for UV photosynthetic abilities was addressed by searching for similar general physical properties which might be manifest in a variety of other simple protocell-like structures. Since it has been shown that laboratory protocell models can effect the UV photosynthesis of low molecular weight compounds, this reaction is being used as an assay to survey other types of structures for similar UV photosynthetic reactions.

CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of true incomplete exchanges is significantly lower in gamma-irradiated human lymphocytes than the frequencies reported in the literature.","[{""volume"":""73"",""submissionId"":20040172641,""issue"":""5"",""issn"":""0955-3002"",""id"":""5dc541ada73949caa20a057093ab0069"",""publicationName"":""International journal of radiation biology"",""publicationDate"":""1998-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040172641
20050218296,REPRINT,International collaboration on Russian spacecraft and the case for free flyer biosatellites,"[""Grindeland, Richard E."",""Ilyin, Eugene A."",""Holley, Daniel C."",""Skidmore, Michael G.""]","Animal research has been critical to the initiation and progress of space exploration. Animals were the original explorers of ""space"" two centuries ago and have played a crucial role by demonstrating that the space environment, with precautions, is compatible with human survival. Studies of mammals have yielded much of our knowledge of space physiology. As spaceflights to other planets are anticipated, animal research will continue to be essential to further reveal space physiology and to enable the longer missions. Much of the physiology data collected from space was obtained from the Cosmos (Bion) spaceflights, a series of Russian (Soviet)-International collaborative flights, over a 22 year period, which employed unmanned, free flyer biosatellites. Begun as a Soviet-only program, after the second flight the Russians invited American and other foreign scientists to participate. This program filled the 10 year hiatus between the last US biosatellite and the first animal experiments on the shuttles. Of the 11 flights in the Cosmos program nine of them were international; the flights continued over the years regardless of political differences between the Soviet Union and the Western world. The science evolved from sharing tissues to joint international planning and development, and from rat postmortem tissue analysis to in vivo measurements of a host of monkey physiological parameters during flight. Many types of biological specimens were carried on the modified Vostok spacecraft, but only the mammalian studies are discussed herein. The types of studies done encompass the full range of physiology and have begun to answer ""critical"" questions of space physiology posed by various ad hoc committees. The studies have not only yielded a prodigious and significant body of data, they have also introduced some new perspectives in physiology. A number of the physiological insights gained are relevant to physiology on Earth. The Cosmos flights also added significantly to flight-related technology, some of which also has application on our planet. In summary, the Cosmos biosatellite flights were extremely productive and of low cost. The Bion vehicles are versatile in that they can be placed into a variety of orbits and altitudes, and can carry radiation sources or other hazardous material which cannot be carried on manned vehicles. With recent advances in sensor, robotic, and data processing technology, future free flyers will be even more productive, and will largely preclude the need to fly animal experiments on manned vehicles. Currently, mammalian researchers do not have access to space for an unknown time, seriously impeding the advancement and understanding of space physiology during long duration missions. Initiation of a new, international program of free flyer biosatellites is critical to our further understanding of space physiology, and essential to continued human exploration of space.","[{""volume"":""10"",""submissionId"":20050218296,""issn"":""1569-2574"",""id"":""bcffdd0c9f43406d873ed02778d9070c"",""publicationName"":""Advances in space biology and medicine"",""publicationDate"":""2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050218296

The upper atmosphere of Mars is exposed to a background radiation field made up of a large number of protons during a solar particle event and mixture of light and heavy ions caused by galactic cosmic rays at other times. In either case, these charged ions interact with the carbon and oxygen atoms of the Martian atmosphere through ionization and nuclear collisions producing secondary ions and neutrons which then interact with the atmospheric atoms in a similar manner. In the past, only these downward moving particles have been counted in evaluating the neutron energy spectrum on the surface. Recent enhancements in the HZETRN code allow for the additional evaluation of those neutrons created within the Martian regolith through the same types of nuclear reactions, which rise to the surface.

20210021533,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Lunar Base Construction Overview,"[""Robert P Mueller""]","Previous lunar missions and campaigns have been restricted to using robotic landers and lunar orbiting satellites as well as sortie type of operations using astronaut crews (NASA  Apollo program). The next phase of lunar exploration has begun under NASA’s Artemis program and there has been an international response where other nations such as China, Russia, India, Canada, Japan and the European Union of nations, have all expressed interest in either collaborating or competing with NASA on the Moon. This next phase has an over arching goal of achieving a permanent human presence on the Moon via sustainable methods. A lunar base with human occupancy will require infrastructure to provide shelter, utilities, landing/launch pads, roads, communications, power and all the other necessities to sustain human life and protect equipment. Since human biology is not well suited for surviving in the lunar environment, there will be many forms of automated equipment, autonomy and robotic helpers that will minimize the amount of Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) required by the crew. This will mean that the radiation dosage received by the crew will stay within acceptable and safe career doses. The required infrastructure must be constructed, but the mass and logistics of bringing all the construction materials from Earth are prohibitive, which makes the necessary construction difficult to achieve. In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) aims to solve this challenge by sourcing construction materials locally or “in-situ”. This means that their transportation can be completely eliminated, resulting in large cost savings by avoiding the launch out of Earth’s deep gravity well and subsequent trans lunar injection, lunar orbit capture and landing. This paper will give an overview of the required construction tasks and related equipment that will be required to robotically build a lunar base using in-situ resources. It will also organize these tasks into logical groupings so that technology development and implementation can be pursued within a framework that can be referenced by all involved.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20210021533,""endDate"":""2022-04-28T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""6457a6ab23c95056a4fd2df12a5908a5"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society of Civil Engineers"",""location"":""Reston, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""5100ec76a4b94d3bb4cc1c79c45adb53"",""id"":""e3bbe5bdbbaf4bd99e23426b4196d5fc""}],""name"":""18th Biennial International Conference: American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Earth & Space 2022 Conference"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""5100ec76a4b94d3bb4cc1c79c45adb53"",""url"":""https://learn.mines.edu/earthspace2022/"",""startDate"":""2022-04-25T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""SW 002""]",undefined,"[""Engineering (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210021533

20190033207,PRESENTATION,Gravity as a Continuum: Effects of Altered Gravity on Drosophila Melanogaster Immunity,"[""Olivieri, Joe"",""Paul, Amber M."",""Bhattacharya, Sharmila""]","The impact of spaceflight on immune function is undoubtedly a critical focus in the area of space biology and human health research. Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins that are expressed in response to cellular and physiological stressors, experienced during radiation exposure, confinement, circadian rhythm disruption, and altered gravity (hypergravity experienced at launch/landing and microgravity experienced in-flight). In particular, Hsp70 aids in the folding of proteins, facilitates the movement of proteins across the membranes during signal transductions and can stimulate innate immunity. Since Hsp70 is induced during cellular stress, and can act as a stimulator for innate immunity, we sought to address how a loss of Hsp70 affects immunity, under the stress-inducing model of acute and chronic hypergravity. Moreover, the effects of gravity as a continuum on the induction of Hsps and key immune genes were also assessed to determine if increased cellular stress, via increased gravity (g)-force, contributes to immune dysfunctions. For this, wildtype (W1118) and Hsp70 deficient (Hsp70null) Drosophila melanogaster were subjected to simulated hypergravity at increasing levels of g-force (1.2g, 3g, and 5g) for acute (1hr) and chronic (7-day) timepoints and were compared to 0g 'non-hypergravity' controls. Following simulation, whole bodies were sex-segregated, RNA was isolated and quantitative (q)PCR was performed to determine differential immune gene expression profiles. Further, functional output of hemocytes were assessed by a phagocytosis assay. Collectively, these studies evaluated the effects of Hsp70 in the context of immunity during acute and chronic hypergravity. Indeed, relevance for this work can directly translate to acute effects of launch/landing gravitational forces upon liftoff (~1.7g) and entry (~3.4g) that astronauts experience. In addition, the effects of chronic cellular stress is directly relevant to the immune health of astronauts on long duration missions, as well. Thus, as we approach the goal of returning to the Moon and landing the first humans on Mars, an evaluation of gravity as a continuum and the stress-inducing effects of altered gravity experienced during spaceflight on astronaut immunity and health are necessary.","[{""submissionId"":20190033207,""id"":""742b2b2b21f0491a9f40b71d755bf76c"",""publicationDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190033207,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""da8371b395c24c9f9a249467f30128d1""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190033207,""endDate"":""2019-11-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""de7b5c111c9c41e4ac1848b90fcee780"",""id"":""6abad9abcc024351b82322c302db9914""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""de7b5c111c9c41e4ac1848b90fcee780"",""startDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNH15CO48B""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190033207

The only other planet known, to date, on which life may have arisen is Mars. The data suggest that the physical environment of early Mars (i.e., temperature, pressure, and radiation regimes) was suitable for life to arise. Thus far, the data also suggest that early Mars possessed sufficient quantities of the required building blocks and a number of the chemical compounds necessary for life to arise. It is not known, however, if water existed in the appropriate state (i.e., liquid) in sufficient quantities long enough for life to arise. Determining the mineralogy and components of the Martian soil through in situ analyses during missions to Mars will provide information from which an assessment can be made for the probability of the origin of life on Mars. Missions to Mars in the near future will be unmanned and capable of in situ analyses. Our studies have shown that differential thermal analysis coupled with gas chromatography (DTA/GC) is a more appropriate analytical technique than, x-ray fluorescence, x-ray diffraction, alpha-proton backscatter, gamma-ray spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry coupled with mass spectrometry (DSC/MS), or DSC/GC to identify the mineralogy of the Martian surface material in situ.

In this report, mutagenic effects of high LET charged particles are quantitatively measured using primary cultures of human skin fibroblasts, and the spectrum of induced mutations are analyzed. The LET of the charged particles ranged from 25 KeV/micrometer to 975 KeV/micrometer with particle energy (on the cells) between 94-603 MeV/u.

The Relative Biological Effect (RBE) for cell-killing ranged from 3.73 to 1.25, while that for mutant induction ranged from 5.74 to 0.48. Maximum RBE values were obtained at the LET of 150 keV/micrometer.

Seedlings rotated on a clinostat reached a similar maximum curvature following photostimulation.

A."",""Dicello, J. F.""]","PURPOSE: To investigate initial chromatid breaks in prematurely condensed G2 chromosomes following exposure to heavy ions of different LET. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exponentially growing human fibroblast cells AG1522 were irradiated with gamma-rays, energetic carbon (13 keV/ microm, 80 keV/microm), silicon (55 keV/microm) and iron (140 keV/microm, 185keV/microm, 440keV/microm) ions. Chromosomes were prematurely condensed using calyculin-A. Initial chromatid-type and isochromatid breaks in G2 cells were scored. RESULTS: The dose response curves for total chromatid breaks were linear regardless of radiation type. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) showed a LET-dependent increase, peaking around 2.7 at 55-80keV/microm and decreasing at higher LET. The dose response curves for isochromatid-type breaks were linear for high-LET radiations, but linear-quadratic for gamma-rays and 13 keV/microm carbon ions. The RBE for the induction of isochromatid breaks obtained from linear components increased rapidly between 13keV/microm (about 7) and 80keV/microm carbon (about 71), and decreased gradually until 440 keV/microm iron ions (about 66). CONCLUSIONS: High-LET radiations are more effective at inducing isochromatid breaks, while low-LET radiations are more effective at inducing chromatid-type breaks. The densely ionizing track structures of heavy ions and the proximity of sister chromatids in G2 cells result in an increase in isochromatid breaks.","[{""volume"":""77"",""submissionId"":20040112536,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0955-3002"",""id"":""be50eb35ce7842b7a9fd67186aea8908"",""publicationName"":""International journal of radiation biology"",""publicationDate"":""2001-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040112536

F.""]","We tabulate the most abundant gases and their radiation yields, for two experimental pressures: 0.24 mb, more relevant to upper atmosphere excitation, and 17 mb, more relevant to tropospheric, cosmic ray excitation. The yields computed in the 0.24 mb experiment combined with measured electronic fluxes and a simple, eddy diffusion model of Titan's atmosphere predict abundances of detected molecules in agreement with those found by Voyager and for heavier products, in somewhat better agreement with observation than photochemical absolute reaction rate kinetics models. All Voyager organics are accounted for and no detectable products are found that Voyager did not detect. A striking increase of products with multiple bonds is found with decreasing pressure. Hydrocarbon abundances decline slowly with increasing carbon number. Additionally, we list preliminary estimates for the yield of the heteropolymer, which seems to be produced in a quantity comparable (in moles of C+N consumed) to the total amount of gaseous product. The production rate required to sustain Titan's haze against sedimentation also indicates yields of this order. As can be seen from the table, over 10(exp 9) years substantial amounts of these products can accumulate on the surface -- ranging from cm thickness for the (C+N equals 4) species to a meter or more for HCN and C2H2; we also expect a meter or more of tholins. Similar analyses have been or are being done for the Jovian planets and Triton. Charged particle irradiation of hydrocarbon clathrates or mixed hydrocarbon/water ices produces a range of organic products, reddening and darkening of the ices and characteristic infrared spectra. From such spectra, the predicted emission by fine particles in cometary comae well-matches the observed 3.4 micron emission spectra of Comet Halley and other recent comets. Heliocentric evolution of organic emission features in comets is predicted. Organic products of such ice irradiation may account for colors and albedos on some of the satellites in the outer solar system, especially Triton and Pluto, where solid methane is known to exist.","[{""submissionId"":19920004390,""id"":""b2a64e02db734cbd9867dab60f653e59"",""publicationName"":""NASA, Washington, Fourth Symposium on Chemical Evolution and the Origin and Evolution of Life"",""publicationDate"":""1991-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Biology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19920004390

20030022663,ABSTRACT,The Sun's Impact on Climate,"[""Cahalan, Robert""]","We provide an overview of the impact of the Sun on the Earth atmosphere and climate system, focused on heating of Earth's atmosphere and oceans. We emphasize the importance of the spectral measurements of SIM and SOLSTICE- that we must know how solar variations are distributed over ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths, since these have separate characteristic influences on Earth's ozone layer, clouds, and upper layers of the oceans. Emphasis is also given to understanding both direct and indirect influences of the Sun on the Earth, which involve feedbacks between Earth's stratosphere, troposphere, and oceans, each with unique time scales, dynamics, chemistry, and biology, interacting non-linearly. Especially crucial is the role of all three phases of water on Earth, water vapor being the primary greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, the importance of trace gases such as CO2 arising from their absorption in the ""water vapor window"" at 800 - 1250/cm (12.5 to 8 microns). Melting of polar ice is one major response to the post-industrial global warming, enhanced due to ""ice-albedo"" feedback. Finally, water in liquid form has a major influence due to cloud albedo feedback, and also due to the oceans' absorption of solar radiation, particularly at visible wavelengths, through the visible ""liquid water window"" that allows penetration of visible light deep into the mixed layer, while nearby ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths do not penetrate past the upper centimeter ocean surface skin layer. A large fraction of solar energy absorbed by the oceans goes into the latent heat of evaporation. Thus the solar heating of the atmosphere-ocean system is strongly coupled through the water cycle of evaporation, cloud formation, precipitation, surface runoff and ice formation, to Earth's energy budget and climate, each different climate component responding to variations in different solar spectral bands, at ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelengths.","[{""submissionId"":20030022663,""id"":""ae2a5ea7b8df4b58a62fc3181375f83e"",""publicationDate"":""2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20030022663,""endDate"":""2002-07-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Source Science Team Meeting"",""id"":""7052fc5efcd94442b8186e0601c42057"",""startDate"":""2002-07-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Meteorology And Climatology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20030022663

C.""]","Excess acentric fragments, consisting of acentric rings and acentric linear fragments, are among the most frequent kinds of chromosome-type aberrations produced by radiation. The frequency of acentric rings cannot be obtained directly by experiment but is estimated here from the ratio of acentric to centric rings, evaluated using a random-walk model for the organization of chromatin during interphase and an assumption that the probability of an exchange formation is proportional to the rate of collision between two DSB. This ratio is calculated to be 2.5 in low-LET irradiated human fibroblasts, significantly greater than the ratio if proximity effects are not considered. The calculated frequency of acentric rings is insufficient to account for all the observed excess acentric fragments. Assuming that the rest of the excess acentric fragments are due to incomplete exchanges, all possible recombinations between two DSB that result in acentric rings and acentric linear fragments have been identified. From the chromosome aberration data, the incompleteness parameter has been estimated. Intra-arm chromosome exchanges, either complete or incomplete, were estimated to account for more than 50% of the excess acentric fragments in human fibroblasts.","[{""volume"":""71"",""submissionId"":20040172970,""issue"":""5"",""issn"":""0955-3002"",""id"":""1226ba9f09f14f56ab357616c7b7fbec"",""publicationName"":""International journal of radiation biology"",""publicationDate"":""1997-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040172970
20010038488,OTHER,Life Sciences Accomplishments 1994,"[""Burnell, Mary Lou""]","The NASA Life and Biomedical Sciences and Applications Division (LBSAD) serves the Nation's life sciences community by managing all aspects of U.S. space-related life sciences research and technology development. The activities of the Division are integral components of the Nation's overall biological sciences and biomedical research efforts. However, NASA's life sciences activities are unique, in that space flight affords the opportunity to study and characterize basic biological mechanisms in ways not possible on Earth. By utilizing access to space as a research tool, NASA advances fundamental knowledge of the way in which weightlessness, radiation, and other aspects of the space-flight environment interact with biological processes. This knowledge is applied to procedures and technologies that enable humans to live and work in and explore space and contributes to the health and well-being of people on Earth. The activities of the Division are guided by the following three goals: Goal 1) Use microgravity and other unique aspects of the space environment to enhance our understanding of fundamental biological processes. Goal 2) Develop the scientific and technological foundations for supporting exploration by enabling productive human presence in space for extended periods. Goal 3) Apply our unique mission personnel, facilities, and technology to improve education, the quality of life on Earth, and U.S. competitiveness. The Division pursues these goals with integrated ground and flight programs involving the participation of NASA field centers, industry, and universities, as well as interactions with other national agencies and NASA's international partners. The published work of Division-sponsored researchers is a record of completed research in pursuit of these goals. During 1993, the LBSAD instituted significant changes in its experiment solicitation and peer review processes. For the first time, a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) was released requesting proposals for ground-based and flight research for all programs. Areas of particular interest to NASA were defined Proposals due April 29, 1994, will be peer reviewed - externally for scientific merit. This annual NRA process is now the mechanism for recruiting both extramural and intramural investigations. As an overview of LBSAD activities in 1993, this accomplishments document covers each of the major organizational components of the Division and the accomplishments of each. The second section is a review of the Space Life Sciences Research programs Space Biology, Space Physiology and Countermeasures, Radiation Health, Environmental Health, Space Human Factors, Advanced Life Support, and Global Monitoring and Disease Prediction, The third section, Research in Space Flight, describes the substantial contributions of the Spacelab Life Sciences 2 (SLS-2) mission to life sciences research and the significant contributions of the other missions flown in 1993, along with plans for future missions. The Division has greatly expanded and given high priority to its Education and Outreach Programs, which are presented in the fourth section. The fifth and final section, Partners for Space, shows the Divisions Cooperative efforts with other national and international agencies to achieve common goals, along with the accomplishments of joint research and analysis programs.","[{""submissionId"":20010038488,""id"":""d4b948454ed0409cba06ba8c808a7fb7"",""publicationDate"":""1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20010038488

The Mars Surveyor Program 2001 Orbiter and Lander missions will mark the first time that experiments dedicated to preparation for human exploration will be carried out. Investigations on these missions and future missions range from characterization of the physical and chemical environment of Mars, to predicting the response of biology to the Mars environment. Planning for such missions must take into account existing data from previous Mars missions which were not necessarily focused on human exploration preparation. At the same time, plans for near term missions by the international community must be considered to avoid duplication of effort.

In preparation for long-duration space missions, NASA is exploring the role of biological systems in recycling waste, generating nutrients, and producing industrial feedstocks. A challenge to specialized biomanufacturing in LEO and applications on long-duration missions is the limited understanding of how space-specific stressors, such as microgravity and the elevated radiation environment, impact standard biomanufacturing processes.
The risk of elevated mutations and lower yields posed by LEO to bioproduction systems utilizing genetically engineered organisms has not been well characterized. As part of the NASA BioNutrients missions, three species of genetically engineered yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y55, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Boulardii, Kluyveromyces lactis) were flown to the ISS for demonstration fermentations, using two generations of on-demand bioproduction systems. The original design, the Production Pack, is a hard-sided polycarbonate case with a valve allowing for rehydration and a screw top lid with a gas-permeable membrane. The second-generation, the Production Bag, utilizes a Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) design that allows for gas exchange across the entire surface of the vessel and a significant reduction in weight. Both generations are pre-loaded with dried media and yeast. The use of dried inputs reduces weight and enables storage at ambient temperatures.

To determine the rates of mutations within the genetically engineered production pathway genes and the yeast genomes at large, DNA was extracted from the end-state of the fermentations and sequenced to at least 100X coverage. The mutational burden imposed by the storage yeast at ambient temperatures within the production vessels before hydration, of fermentation in microgravity relative to ground controls, and of the differences in vessel design will all be considered. We present an overview of the two bioproduction designs, the types of data collected from the fermentation end-states, and the computational workflow employed to determine the difference in mutation burden after fermentation across the various conditions. When completed, the data generated by the BioNutrients missions will enable the develop of robust bioproduction systems adapted for space.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20250006950,""endDate"":""2025-07-30T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""7897d8237556501099271709db713c76"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology"",""location"":""Fairfax, United States""}},""meetingId"":""796de629291b4460a12a399c50801714"",""id"":""c71c872f52d54804978ca0a6ef1cffbd""}],""name"":""Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology 2025"",""location"":""San Francisco, CA"",""id"":""796de629291b4460a12a399c50801714"",""url"":""https://sim.confex.com/sim/2025/meetingapp.cgi/Home/0"",""startDate"":""2025-07-27T07:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C"",""80ARC024DA004"",""80HQTR21CA005"",""858549.07.01.04.21"","" 596118.04.25.21.07""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250006950
20140013122,OTHER,2013 Immune Risk Standing Review Panel Research Plan Review for: The Risk of Crew Adverse Health Event Due to Altered Immune Response,"[""Steinberg, Susan""]","The 2013 Immune Risk Standing Review Panel (from here on referred to as the SRP) participated in a meeting with representatives from the Human Research Program (HRP) Human Health Countermeasures (HHC) Element and HRP management on February 3-4, 2014 in Houston, TX to review the updated Research Plan for the Risk of Crew Adverse Health Event Due to Altered Immune Response in the HRP Integrated Research Plan. The SRP is impressed with the work the immune discipline has done since the 2012 SRP review and agrees with the new wording of the Gaps, no longer questions, now statements. The SRP also likes the addition of adding targets for closing the Gaps, but it is not clear how they got to some of the interim stages (interval percentages). A major concern that the SRP has mentioned since the initial 2009 SRP meeting is that there is still not enough emphasis on the interdisciplinary aspect of the immune risk associated with other risks (i.e., nutrition, radiation, etc.). The SRP recommends that a ""translational SRP"" or advisory group be developed that is composed of members from all of the HRP SRPs. The SRP also thinks that the immune discipline should consider a more systems biology approach. Lastly, the SRP is concerned that the risks observed in research from low Earth orbit (LEO) missions may not accurately reflect all the risks of longer duration flight beyond LEO. Also, there does not seem to be a concern for immune responses that may occur when someone is in space longer than six months, for example, a Mars mission would take three years. The absence of disease in past and current flight scenarios does not mean the risk may not be there in future flight settings.","[{""submissionId"":20140013122,""id"":""05e821949dbb4922a761609eb452af19"",""publicationDate"":""2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140013122
19920004436,CONFERENCE_PAPER,A directed search for extraterrestrial laser signals,"[""Betz, A.""]","The focus of NASA's Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Program is on microwave frequencies, where receivers have the best sensitivities for the detection of narrowband signals. Such receivers, when coupled to existing radio telescopes, form an optimal system for broad area searches over the sky. For a directed search, however, such as toward specific stars, calculations show that infrared wavelengths can be equally as effective as radio wavelengths for establishing an interstellar communication link. This is true because infrared telescopes have higher directivities (gains) that effectively compensate for the lower sensitivities of infrared receivers. The result is that, for a given level of transmitted power, the signal to noise ratio for communications is equally as good at infrared and radio wavelengths. It should also be noted that the overall sensitivities of both receiver systems are quite close to their respective fundamental limits: background thermal noise for the radio frequency system and quantum noise for the infrared receiver. Consequently, the choice of an optimum communication frequency may well be determined more by the achievable power levels of transmitters rather than the ultimate sensitivities of receivers at any specific frequency. In the infrared, CO2 laser transmitters with power levels greater than 1 MW can already be built on Earth. For a slightly more advanced civilization, a similar but enormously more powerful laser may be possible using a planetary atmosphere rich in CO2. Because of these possibilities and our own ignorance of what is really the optimum search frequency, a search for narrowband signals at infrared frequencies should be a part of a balanced SETI Program. Detection of narrowband infrared signals is best done with a heterodyne receiver functionally identical to a microwave spectral line receiver. We have built such a receiver for the detection of CO2 laser radiation at wavelengths near 10 microns. The spectrometer uses a high-speed HgCdTe diode as the photomixer and a small CO2 laser as the local oscillator. Output signals in the intermediate frequency range 0.1-2.6 GHz are processed by a 1000-channel acousto-optic signal processor. The receiver is being used on a 1.5-m telescope on Mt. Wilson to survey a selected sample of 150 nearby stars. The current status of the work is discussed along with future project plans.","[{""submissionId"":19920004436,""id"":""7a23b8c8157946d7b883f3bd871f062b"",""publicationName"":""NASA, Washington, Fourth Symposium on Chemical Evolution and the Origin and Evolution of Life"",""publicationDate"":""1991-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Biology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19920004436

The cell has enzymatic mechanisms to repair such breaks; however, these mechanisms are imperfect and, in an exchange process, may produce a large-scale rearrangement of the genome, called a chromosome aberration. Chromosome aberrations are important in killing cells, during carcinogenesis, in characterizing repair/misrepair pathways, in retrospective radiation biodosimetry, and in a number of other ways. DNA staining techniques such as mFISH ( multicolor fluorescent in situ hybridization) provide a means for analyzing aberration spectra by examining observed final patterns. Unfortunately, an mFISH observed final pattern often does not uniquely determine the underlying exchange process. Further, resolution limitations in the painting protocol sometimes lead to apparently incomplete final patterns. We here describe an algorithm for systematically finding exchange processes consistent with any observed final pattern. This algorithm uses aberration multigraphs, a mathematical formalism that links the various aspects of aberration formation. By applying a measure to the space of consistent multigraphs, we will show how to generate model-specific distributions of aberration processes from mFISH experimental data. The approach is implemented by software freely available over the internet. As a sample application, we apply these algorithms to an aberration data set, obtaining a distribution of exchange cycle sizes, which serves to measure aberration complexity. Estimating complexity, in turn, helps indicate how damaging the aberrations are and may facilitate identification of radiation type in retrospective biodosimetry.","[{""volume"":""14"",""submissionId"":20100039449,""issue"":""2"",""id"":""f5d1860f9c72489ab968ebadbfc20816"",""publicationName"":""Journal of Computational Biology"",""publicationDate"":""2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNJ06HA27G"",""NNJ04HJ12G"",""ROl-GM68423"",""NNJ04HF42G"",""DE-FG03-02ER63442"",""DE-FG02-03ER63668""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100039449
20080040177,PREPRINT,A Satellite-based Assessment of Trans-Pacific Transport of Pollution Aerosol,"[""Yu, Hongbin"",""Remer, Lorraine"",""Chin, Mian"",""Bian, Huisheng"",""Kleidman, Richard"",""Diehl. Thomas""]","It has been well documented that pollution aerosol and dust from East Asia can transport across the North Pacific basin, reaching North America and beyond. Such intercontinental transport extends the impact of aerosols for climate change, air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and ocean biology from local and regional scales to hemispheric and global scales. Long term, measurement-based studies are necessary to adequately assess the implications of these wider impacts. A satellite-based assessment can augment intensive field campaigns by expanding temporal and spatial scales and also serve as constraints for model simulations. Satellite imagers have been providing a wealth of evidence for the intercontinental transport of aerosols for more than two decades. Quantitative assessments, however, became feasible only recently as a result of the much improved measurement accuracy and enhanced new capabilities of satellite sensors. In this study, we generated a 4-year (2002 to 2005) climatology of optical depth for pollution aerosol (defined as a mixture of aerosols from urbanlindustrial pollution and biomass burning in this study) over the North Pacific from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) observations of fine- and coarse-mode aerosol optical depths. The pollution aerosol mass loading and fluxes were then calculated using measurements of the dependence of aerosol mass extinction efficiency on relative humidity and of aerosol vertical distributions from field campaigns and available satellite observations in the region. We estimated that about 18 Tg/year pollution aerosol is exported from East Asia to the northwestern Pacific Ocean, of which about 25% reaches the west coast of North America. The pollution fluxes are largest in spring and smallest in summer. For the period we have examined the strongest export and import of pollution particulates occurred in 2003, due largely to record intense Eurasia wildfires in spring and summer. The overall uncertainty of pollution fluxes is estimated at about 80%. A reduction of uncertainty can be achieved with a better characterization of pollution aerosol through integrating emerging A-Train measurements. Simulations by the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) and Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) models agree quite well with the satellite-based estimates of annual and latitudeintegrated fluxes, with larger model-satellite differences in latitudinal variations of fluxes.","[{""submissionId"":20080040177,""id"":""a82776c6318e4ccfab2cb2c1c85ed7ea"",""publicationDate"":""2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Meteorology And Climatology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080040177

This paper mostly describes the first of these NASA-supported trials, began on Aug. 13, 1995. Plants were sampled five times and harvested on Nov. 9 after 90 days. Equipment failures led to low irradiance (3, then 4 of 6 lamp sets failed), instances of high temperatures (ca. 37 degrees C), and sometimes excessive substrate moisture. Although plants grew for the 90 d, no wheat heads were produced. Considering the low light levels, plants were surprisingly green, but of course biomass production was low. Plants were highly disoriented (low light, mirror walls?). Fixed and dried samples and the root module were returned on the U.S. Shuttle Atlantis on Nov. 20, 1995. Samples of the substrate, a nutrient-charged zeolite called Balkanine, were taken from the root module, carefully examined for roots, weighed, dried, and reweighed. The Svet control unit and the light bank were shipped to Moscow. An experiment validation test (EVT) of plant growth and experimental procedures, carried out in Moscow, was highly successful. Equipment built in Utah to measure CO2, H2O vapor, irradiance, air and leaf (IR) temperature, O2, pressure, and substrate moisture worked well in the EVT and in space.

Exponentially growing human fibroblast cells AG1522 were irradiated with gamma-rays, energetic carbon (290 MeV/u), silicon (490 MeV/u) and iron (200 MeV/u, 600 MeV/u). Chromosomes were prematurely condensed using calyculin A. Prematurely condensed chromosomes were collected after several post-irradiation incubation times, ranging from 5 to 600 minutes, and the number of chromatid breaks and exchanges in G2 cells were scored. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for initial chromatid breaks per unit dose showed LET dependency having a peak at 55 keV/micrometers silicon (2.4) or 80 keV/micrometers carbon particles (2.4) and then decreased with increasing LET. The kinetics of chromatid break rejoining following low- or high-LET irradiation consisted of two exponential components.

20010125645,ABSTRACT,Measurement of Effective Canopy Temperature: The Missing Link to Modeling Transpiration in Controlled Environments,"[""Monje, O. A."",""McCormack, Ann"",""Bugbee, Bruce"",""Jones, Harry W., Jr.""]","The objectives were to apply energy balance principles to plant canopies, and to determine which parameters are essential for predicting plant canopy transpiration (E) in controlled environments. Transpiration was accurately measured in a gas-exchange system. Absorbed radiation (R(sub abs)) by the canopy was measured with a net radiometer and calculated from short and long-wave radiation components. Average canopy foliar temperature T(sub L) can be measured with an infrared radiometer, but since T(sub L) is seldom uniform, a weighed average measurement of T(sub L) must be made. The effective canopy temperature T(sub C) is that temperature that balances the energy flux between absorbed radiation and latent heat L(sub E) and sensible heat (H) fluxes. TC should exactly equal air temperature T(sub A) when L(sub E) equals R(sub abs). When unnecessary thermal radiation from the lighting system is removed by a water filter, the magnitude of L(sub E) from transpiration approaches Rabs and T(sub C) is close to T(sub A). Unlike field models, we included the energy used in photosynthesis and found that up to 10% of Rabs was used in photosynthesis. We calculated aerodynamic conductance for H from measurements of wind speed and canopy height using the wind profile equation. Canopy aerodynamic conductance ranged from.03 to.04 m/s for wind speeds from.6 to 1 m/s; thus a 0.1 C canopy to air temperature difference results in a sensible heat flux of about 4 W/sq m, which is only 1% of R(sub abs). We examined the ability of wide angle infrared transducers to accurately integrate T(sub L) from the top to the bottom of the canopy. We measured evaporation from the hydroponic media to be approximately 1 micro mol/sq m s or 10% of R(sub abs). This result indicates that separating evaporation from transpiration is more important than exact measurement of canopy temperature.","[{""submissionId"":20010125645,""id"":""753f02771e264320b08b0b94c18f70bf"",""publicationDate"":""1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20010125645,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""6cc2417caf46415a86c92d41b1705014""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20010125645,""endDate"":""1994-10-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""a3fa67abad3844f3a5b900d632f95bcf"",""id"":""06a12a1dcdf84c2794736967e94d8aa1""}],""name"":""10th American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology Meeting"",""location"":""San Francisco, CA"",""id"":""a3fa67abad3844f3a5b900d632f95bcf"",""startDate"":""1994-10-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""RTOP 199-61-62""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20010125645

The Terahertz (THz) region of the electromagnetic spectrum (approx.300-3000 GHz) has enormous potential for high-data-rate communications, spectroscopy, astronomy, space research, medicine, biology, surveillance, remote sensing, industrial process control, etc. The most critical roadblock to full exploitation of the THz band is lack of coherent radiation sources that are powerful (0.01-10.0 W continuous wave), efficient (>1 %), frequency agile (instantaneously tunable over 1% bandwidths or more), reliable, and relatively inexpensive. Micro-machined Vacuum Electron Devices (micro-VEDs) represent a promising solution. We describe prospects for miniature, THz-regime TWTs fabricated using micromachining techniques. Several approx.600 GHz conceptual designs are compared. Their expected performance has been analyzed using SD, 2.51), and 3D TWT codes. A folded waveguide (FWG) TWT forward-wave amplifier design is presented based on a Northrop Grumman (NGC) optimized design procedure. This conceptual device is compared to the simulated performance of a novel, micro-VED helix TWT. Conceptual FWG TWT backward-wave amplifiers and oscillators are also discussed. A scaled (100 GHz) FWG TWT operating at a relatively low voltage (-12 kV) is under development at NGC. Also, actual-size micromachining experiments are planned to evaluate the feasibility of arrays of micro-VED TWTs. Progress and results of these efforts are described.

The attention has focused primarily on the assignation of a quality factor (Q) which would take into account the greater effectiveness of heavy ions vis-a-vis other forms of ionizing radiation. If, however, as the so-called 'microlesion theory' allows, the passage of HZE particles through living tissue produces unique biological damage, the traditional use of Q becomes meaningless. Therefore, it is critical to determine if microlesions, in fact, do exist. While the concept does not necessarily require detectable morphological damage, 'tunnel-lesions' or holes in ocular tissues have been cited as evidence of microlesions. These data, however, are open to reinterpretation. Ongoing light, scanning and transmission electron microscopic studies of the corneas, lenses and retinas of rat eyes exposed to 450 MeV/amu Fe-56 ions thus far have not revealed tunnel-lesion damage. The morphological effects of the heavy ions have been found to be qualitatively similar to the changes following other kinds of ionizing radiation.","[{""submissionId"":19890066866,""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""8aec5f7b3e2c4f539ba3324fc0ca8f07"",""publicationName"":""- Radiation Biology, Espoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research"",""publicationDate"":""1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NIH-EY-02648"",""NAG9-256""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19890066866

20040089166,REPRINT,Engineering plants for spaceflight environments,"[""Bugbee, B.""]","The conversion efficiency of radiation into biomass and yield has steadily increased for centuries because of continued improvement in both plant genetics and environmental control. Considerable effort has gone into improving the environment for plant growth in space, but work has only begun to engineer plants for spaceflight. Genetic manipulation offers tremendous potential to improve our ability to study gravitational effects. Genetic manipulation will also be necessary to build an efficient regenerative life support system. We cannot fully characterize plant response to the spaceflight environment without understanding and manipulating their genetic composition. Identification and selection of the existing germplasm is the first step. There are thousands of cultivars of each of our major crop plants, each specifically adapted to a unique environment on our planet. Thousands of additional lines are held in national germplasm collections to maintain genetic diversity. Spaceflight imposes the need to tap this diversity. Existing lines need to be evaluated in the environment that is characteristic of closed-system spaceflight conditions. Many of the plant growth challenges we confront in space can be better solved through genetic change than by hardware engineering. Ten thousand years of plant breeding has demonstrated the value of matching genetics with the environment. For example, providing continuous light can increase plant growth in space, but this often induces calcium deficiencies because Ca is not supplied by guttation during a dark period. This deficiency cannot be eliminated through increased root-zone and foliar Ca applications. It can be solved, in wheat, through genetic selection of lines that do not have the deficiency. Subsequent comparison of lines with and without the Ca deficiency has also helped us understand the nature of the problem.","[{""volume"":""12"",""submissionId"":20040089166,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""1089-988X"",""id"":""43118b72bda64b33af791d92acb19d51"",""publicationName"":""Gravitational and space biology bulletin :  publication of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""publicationDate"":""1999-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089166

Stem length was significantly reduced by seismic stress at 135 micromoles m-2 s-1 but this effect was insignificant at higher PPFs.  Reduced stem length resulted from an inhibition of internode elongation.  Stem diameter was unaffected by stress at the PPFs tested.

Various fluence rates of unilateral red light were tested to determine whether both tropisms operate simultaneously. At irradiances > or = 140 nmol m-2 s-1 no gravitropism could be detected and phototropism predominated, despite the presence of amyloplast sedimentation. Gravitropism occurred at irradiances lower than 140 nmol m-1 s-1 with most cells oriented above the horizontal but not upright. At these low fluence rates, phototropism was indistinct at 1 g but apparent in microgravity, indicating that gravitropism and phototropism compete at 1 g. The frequency of protonemata that were negatively phototropic varied with the fluence rate and the duration of illumination, as well as with the position of the apical cell before illumination. These data show that the fluence rate of red light regulates whether gravitropism is allowed or completely repressed, and that it influences the polarity of phototropism and the extent to which apical cells are aligned in the light path.","[{""volume"":""209"",""submissionId"":20040141814,""issue"":""3"",""issn"":""0032-0935"",""id"":""7b0db4ca86e5424b817ea01ef8783614"",""publicationName"":""Planta"",""publicationDate"":""1999-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG10-0179""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040141814

Using Northern analysis we showed a 5-6 fold increase in the levels of three specific mRNAs and a 14-fold increase in plastid mRNA.  This increase is rapid, occurring within 30 minutes of illumination.  With prolonged periods of darkness following illumination, messages return to levels observed in dark, control caps.  For two species of mRNA illumination results in a reduction in message levels.  Light-stimulated increases in the levels of specific mRNAs are proportionally greater than are increases in the activities of corresponding proteins.  We suggest that the light-stimulated increase in protein activity in root caps may be preceded by and occur as a consequence of enhanced levels of mRNA.  Our work suggests that photomorphogenesis in roots could involve changes in the levels of a wide variety of mRNAs within the root cap.","[{""volume"":""11"",""submissionId"":20040089498,""issn"":""0167-4412"",""id"":""40477aec8c754ab7b99f6902ecabb644"",""publicationName"":""Plant molecular biology"",""publicationDate"":""1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089498

A.""]","On August 3, 1977, the Soviet Union launched Cosmos 936, an unmanned spacecraft carrying biology and physics experiments from 9 countries, including both the Soviet Union and U.S. The launch marked the second time the Soviet Union has flown U.S. experiments aboard one of its spacecraft, the first being Cosmos 782 launched Nov. 25, 1975, which remained in orbit 19.5 days. Aboard Cosmos 936 were: 30 young male Wistar SPF rats, 20 of which was exposed to hypogravity during flight while the remainder were subjected to a l x g acceleration by continuous configuration; 2) experiments with plants and fruit flies; 3) radiation physics experiments; and 4) a heat convection experiment. After 18.5 days in orbit, the spacecraft landed in central Asia where a Soviet recovery team began experiment operations, including animal autopsies, within 4.5 hr of landing. Half of the animals were autopsied at the recovery site and the remainder returned to Moscow and allowed to readapt to terrestrial gravity for 25 days after which they, too, were autopsied. Specimens for U.S. were initially prepared at the recovery site or Soviet laboratories and transferred to U.S. laboratories for complete analyses. An overview of the mission focusing on preflight, on-orbit, and postflight activities pertinent to the seven U.S. experiments aboard Cosmos 936 will be presented.","[{""volume"":""21"",""submissionId"":20000021210,""issue"":""4"",""id"":""5aeecc5bc7394c90829c157e30a6898a"",""publicationName"":""Physiologist"",""publicationDate"":""1978-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Spacecraft Design, Testing And Performance""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000021210

In blue or white light, roots exhibit negative phototropism, but red light induces positive phototropism in Arabidopsis roots. Phytochrome A (phyA) and phyB mediate the positive red-light-based photoresponse in roots since single mutants (and the double phyAB mutant) were severely impaired in this response. In blue-light-based negative phototropism, phyA and phyAB (but not phyB) were inhibited in the response relative to the WT. In root gravitropism, phyB and phyAB (but not phyA) were inhibited in the response compared to the WT. The differences observed in tropistic responses were not due to growth limitations since the growth rates among all the mutants tested were not significantly different from that of the WT. Thus, our study shows that the blue-light and red-light systems interact in roots and that phytochrome plays a key role in plant development by integrating multiple environmental stimuli. c2003 COSPAR.

20190032412,REPRINT,Maximum Carbon Uptake Rate Dominates the Interannual Variability of Global Net Ecosystem Exchange,"[""Fu, Zheng"",""Stoy, Paul C."",""Poulter, Benjamin"",""Gerken, Tobias"",""Zhang, Zhen"",""Wakbulcho, Guta"",""Niu, Shuli""]","Terrestrial ecosystems contribute most of the interannual variability (IAV) in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, but processes driving the IAV of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) remain elusive. For a predictive understanding of the global C cycle, it is imperative to identify indicators associated with ecological processes that determine the IAV of NEE. Here, we decompose the annual NEE of global terrestrial ecosystems into their phenological and physiological components, namely maximum carbon uptake (MCU) and release (MCR), the carbon uptake period (CUP), and two parameters, α and β, that describe the ratio between actual versus hypothetical maximum C sink and source, respectively. Using long‐term observed NEE from 66 eddy covariance sites and global products derived from FLUXNET observations, we found that the IAV of NEE is determined predominately by MCU at the global scale, which explains 48% of the IAV of NEE on average while α, CUP, β, and MCR explain 14%, 25%, 2%, and 8%, respectively. These patterns differ in water‐limited ecosystems versus temperature‐ and radiation‐limited ecosystems; 31% of the IAV of NEE is determined by the IAV of CUP in water‐limited ecosystems, and 60% of the IAV of NEE is determined by the IAV of MCU in temperature‐ and radiation‐limited ecosystems. The Lund‐Potsdam‐Jena (LPJ) model and the Multi‐scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Inter‐comparison Project (MsTMIP) models underestimate the contribution of MCU to the IAV of NEE by about 18% on average, and overestimate the contribution of CUP by about 25%. This study provides a new perspective on the proximate causes of the IAV of NEE, which suggest that capturing the variability of MCU is critical for modeling the IAV of NEE across most of the global land surface.

20160010309,BOOK_CHAPTER,The Impact of ARM on Climate Modeling,"[""Randall, David A."",""Del Genio, Anthony D."",""Donner, Leo J."",""Collins, William D."",""Klein, Stephen A.""]","Climate models are among humanity's most ambitious and elaborate creations. They are designed to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and cryosphere on time scales far beyond the limits of deterministic predictability, and including the effects of time-dependent external forcings. The processes involved include radiative transfer, fluid dynamics, microphysics, and some aspects of geochemistry, biology, and ecology. The models explicitly simulate processes on spatial scales ranging from the circumference of the Earth down to one hundred kilometers or smaller, and implicitly include the effects of processes on even smaller scales down to a micron or so. The atmospheric component of a climate model can be called an atmospheric global circulation model (AGCM). In an AGCM, calculations are done on a three-dimensional grid, which in some of today's climate models consists of several million grid cells. For each grid cell, about a dozen variables are time-stepped as the model integrates forward from its initial conditions. These so-called prognostic variables have special importance because they are the only things that a model remembers from one time step to the next; everything else is recreated on each time step by starting from the prognostic variables and the boundary conditions. The prognostic variables typically include information about the mass of dry air, the temperature, the wind components, water vapor, various condensed-water species, and at least a few chemical species such as ozone. A good way to understand how climate models work is to consider the lengthy and complex process used to develop one. Lets imagine that a new AGCM is to be created, starting from a blank piece of paper. The model may be intended for a particular class of applications, e.g., high-resolution simulations on time scales of a few decades. Before a single line of code is written, the conceptual foundation of the model must be designed through a creative envisioning that starts from the intended application and is based on current understanding of how the atmosphere works and the inventory of mathematical methods available.","[{""volume"":""57"",""submissionId"":20160010309,""publisher"":""American Meteorological Society"",""id"":""4e2095dec8ac425aa7409339be31e3c2"",""publicationName"":""The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program: The First 20 Years"",""publicationDate"":""2016-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DOE DE-AC52-07NA27344"",""WBS 199008.02.04.10U864.15""]",undefined,"[""Meteorology And Climatology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160010309
20040090420,REPRINT,Desensitization and recovery of phototropic responsiveness in Arabidopsis thaliana,"[""Janoudi, A. K."",""Poff, K. L.""]","Phototropism is induced by blue light, which also induces desensitization, a partial or total loss of phototropic responsiveness.  The fluence and fluence-rate dependence of desensitization and recovery from desensitization have been measured for etiolated and red light (669-nm) preirradiated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings.  The extent of desensitization increased as the fluence of the desensitizing 450-nm light was increased from 0.3 to 60 micromoles m-2 s-1.  At  equal fluences, blue light caused more desensitization when given at a fluence rate of 1.0 micromole m-2 s-1 than at 0.3 micromole m-2 s-1.  In addition, seedlings irradiated with blue light at the higher fluence rate required a longer recovery time than seedlings irradiated at the lower fluence rate.  A red light preirradiation, probably mediated via phytochrome, decreased the time required for recovery from desensitization.  The minimum time for detectable recovery was about 65 s, and the maximum time observed was about 10 min.  It is proposed that the descending arm of the fluence-response relationship for first positive phototropism is a consequence of desensitization, and that the time threshold for second positive phototropism establishes a period during which recovery from desensitization occurs.","[{""volume"":""101"",""submissionId"":20040090420,""issn"":""0032-0889"",""id"":""ad7b6c0785d94433a5342e9618214929"",""publicationName"":""Plant physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DE-FG-02-90EK-20021""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090420

Costes""]","The NASA GeneLab project capitalizes on multi-omic technologies to maximize the return on spaceflight experiments. To do this, GeneLab maintains a publicly accessible database (GLDS) that houses spaceflight and spaceflight relevant multi-omics data and collaborates with NASA principal investigators and projects to generate additional omics data. GeneLab houses more than 220 transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and epigenomic datasets from plant, animal and microbial experiments, with a growing number of these having been produced by the GeneLab sample processing lab. The GLDS contains rich metadata about each experiment and has recently integrated radiation dosimetry data from experiments flown on the Space Shuttle. GeneLab has also recently implemented an effort to present processed data in the GLDS in addition to the raw omics data. The processed data will enable interpretation of the data by a larger group of students, scientists and the general public. Standard pipelines for the transformation of raw data into visualizations were developed by four GeneLab Analysis Working Groups (animals, plants, microbes, multi-omics) comprised of over 120 scientists from NASA, industry, and academia. To explore the data, the GLDS provides users various tools for data analysis, collaborative workspace for file storage and sharing, and a visualization portal. The analysis platform built using the Galaxy toolshed provides access to a broad variety of users including those with limited bioinformatics experience and students to learn how to analyze spaceflight omics data. The visualization portal takes GeneLab one step closer to data democratization by removing all bioinformatics requisites to interpret transcriptomics data hosted in the repository.

WTK1 cells were much more susceptible to mutagenesis following proton exposure than TK6 cells. Intragenic deletions were observed among early-arising TK1 mutants in TK6 cells, but not in WTK1 cells where all of the mutants arose by LOH. Deletion was the predominant mode of LOH in TK6 cells, while allelic recombination was the major mode of LOH in WTK1 cells. Deletions were of variable lengths, from <1 cM to 64 cM, while mutations that arose by allelic recombination often extended to the telomere.

J.""]","A CDNA encoding a 47 kDa nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) that is associated with the chromatin of pea nuclei has been cloned and sequenced. The translated sequence of the cDNA includes several domains predicted by known biochemical properties of the enzyme, including five motifs characteristic of the ATP-binding domain of many proteins, several potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, a helix-turn-helix region characteristic of DNA-binding proteins, and a potential calmodulin-binding domain. The deduced primary structure also includes an N-terminal sequence that is a predicted signal peptide and an internal sequence that could serve as a bipartite-type nuclear localization signal. Both in situ immunocytochemistry of pea plumules and immunoblots of purified cell fractions indicate that most of the immunodetectable NTPase is within the nucleus, a compartment proteins typically reach through nuclear pores rather than through the endoplasmic reticulum pathway. The translated sequence has some similarity to that of human lamin C, but not high enough to account for the earlier observation that IgG against human lamin C binds to the NTPase in immunoblots. Northern blot analysis shows that the NTPase MRNA is strongly expressed in etiolated plumules, but only poorly or not at all in the leaf and stem tissues of light-grown plants. Accumulation of NTPase mRNA in etiolated seedlings is stimulated by brief treatments with both red and far-red light, as is characteristic of very low-fluence phytochrome responses.

E."",""Woodruff, K."",""Clark, G. B."",""Roux, S. J.""]","The abundance of plant nucleolin mRNA is regulated during de-etiolation by phytochrome. A close correlation between the mRNA abundance of nucleolin and mitosis has also been previously reported. These results raised the question of whether the effects of light on nucleolin mRNA expression were a consequence of light effects on mitosis. To test this we compared the kinetics of light-mediated increases in cell proliferation with that of light-mediated changes in the abundance of nucleolin mRNA using plumules of dark-grown pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings. These experiments show that S-phase increases 9 h after a red light pulse, followed by M-phase increases in the plumule leaves at 12 h post-irradiation, a time course consistent with separately measured kinetics of red light-induced increases in the expression of cell cycle-regulated genes. These increases in cell cycle-regulated genes are photoreversible, implying that the light-induced increases in cell proliferation are, like nucleolin mRNA expression, regulated via phytochrome. Red light stimulates increases in the mRNA for nucleolin at 6 h post-irradiation, prior to any cell proliferation changes and concurrent with the reported timing of phytochrome-mediated increases of rRNA abundance. After a green light pulse, nucleolin mRNA levels increase without increasing S-phase or M-phase. Studies in animals and yeast indicate that nucleolin plays a significant role in ribosome biosynthesis. Consistent with this function, pea nucleolin can rescue nucleolin deletion mutants of yeast that are defective in rRNA synthesis. Our data show that during de-etiolation, the increased expression of nucleolin mRNA is more directly regulated by light than by mitosis.","[{""volume"":""125"",""submissionId"":20040112616,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""0032-0889"",""id"":""941384a6c24b4cffa69bde91cb7f3187"",""publicationName"":""Plant physiology"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040112616

J.""]","These experiments tested the hypothesis that phototropic bending arises when a light gradient across the stem differentially inhibits cell elongation because of direct inhibition of cell elongation by light (the Blaauw hypothesis).  Continuous irradiation of dark-grown cucumber seedlings (Cucumis sativus L.) with unilateral blue light inhibited hypocotyl elongation within 30 s, but did not induce phototropic curvature until 4.5 h after the start of irradiation.  Marking experiments showed that curvature began simultaneously at the top and bottom of the growing region.  In situ measurements of the light gradient across the stem with a glass fiber optic indicated that a 5- to 6-fold difference in fluence rate was established on the two sides of the stem.  The light gradient established at the start of irradiation was the same as that after 6 h of irradiation.  Changes in gravitropic responsiveness during this period were also ruled out.  Calculations show that the light gradient should have caused curvature which would be detectable within 30 to 60 min and which would extrapolate to the start of irradiation--if the Blaauw hypothesis were correct.  The long lag for phototropism in this case indicates that rapid inhibition of cell elongation by blue light does not cause the asymmetrical growth of phototropism.  Rather, phototropism is superimposed upon this separate light growth response.","[{""volume"":""42"",""submissionId"":20040089927,""issue"":""6"",""issn"":""0031-8655"",""id"":""23748fc1858444eebfae4795e97afad2"",""publicationName"":""Photochemistry and photobiology"",""publicationDate"":""1985-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089927

L.""]","The relationship between the amount of light and the amount of response for any photobiological process  can be based on the number of incident quanta per unit time (fluence rate-response) or on the number of incident  quanta during a given period of irradiation (fluence-response).  Fluence-response and fluence rate-response relationships have been measured for second positive phototropism by seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana.  The fluence-response relationships exhibit a single limiting threshold at about 0.01 micromole per square meter when measured at fluence rates from 2.4 x 10(-5)  to 6.5 x 10(-3) micromoles per square meter per second.  The threshold values in the  fluence rate-response curves decrease with increasing time of irradiation, but show a common  fluence threshold at about  0.01 micromole per square meter.  These thresholds  are the same as the threshold of about 0.01 micromole per square meter measured for first positive phototropism.  Based on these data, it is suggested that second positive curvature has a threshold in time of about 10 minutes.  Moreover, if the times of irradiation exceed the time threshold, there is a single limiting fluence threshold at about 0.01 micromole per square meter.  Thus, the limiting fluence  threshold for second positive phototropism is the same as the fluence threshold for first positive phototropism.  Based on these data, we suggest that this common fluence threshold for first positive and second positive phototropism is set by a single photoreceptor pigment system.","[{""volume"":""94"",""submissionId"":20040112064,""issn"":""0032-0889"",""id"":""efde46a0fe3c45819e38ef5c9fefd310"",""publicationName"":""Plant physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DE-ACO2-76ERO-1338""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040112064

Mainly due to longer patient survival times, these second cancers have become of increasing concern. Estimating the risk of solid second cancers involves modeling: because of long latency times, available data is usually for older, obsolescent treatment regimens. Moreover, modeling second cancers gives unique insights into human carcinogenesis, since the therapy involves administering well characterized doses of a well studied carcinogen, followed by long-term monitoring. In addition to putative radiation initiation that produces pre-malignant cells, inactivation (i.e. cell killing), and subsequent cell repopulation by proliferation can be important at the doses relevant to second cancer situations. A recent initiation/inactivation/proliferation (IIP) model characterized quantitatively the observed occurrence of second breast and lung cancers, using a deterministic cell population dynamics approach. To analyze ifradiation-initiated pre-malignant clones become extinct before full repopulation can occur, we here give a stochastic version of this I I model. Combining Monte Carlo simulations with standard solutions for time-inhomogeneous birth-death equations, we show that repeated cycles of inactivation and repopulation, as occur during fractionated radiation therapy, can lead to distributions of pre-malignant cells per patient with variance >> mean, even when pre-malignant clones are Poisson-distributed. Thus fewer patients would be affected, but with a higher probability, than a deterministic model, tracking average pre-malignant cell numbers, would predict. Our results are applied to data on breast cancers after radiotherapy for Hodgkin disease. The stochastic IIP analysis, unlike the deterministic one, indicates: a) initiated, pre-malignant cells can have a growth advantage during repopulation, not just during the longer tumor latency period that follows; b) weekend treatment gaps during radiotherapy, apart from decreasing the probability of eradicating the primary cancer, substantially increase the risk of later second cancers.","[{""volume"":""249"",""submissionId"":20100039450,""issue"":""3"",""id"":""6011f4a6288c4cc2818a479355fb03eb"",""publicationName"":""Journal of Theoretical Biology"",""publicationDate"":""2007-12-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNJ06HA27G"",""P41-EB-002033"",""CA78496"",""DEFG02-03ER63668"",""F16R-CT-2003-508842"",""NSCOR04-0014-0017"",""03-OBPR-07-0059-0065""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100039450

In addition, in both strains, gravitropism is decreased compared to the wild type by an amount which is comparable to the decrease in phototropism.

This fluorescence is due to chlorophyll as evidenced from 1) a fluorescence-emission spectrum in vivo, where a bright fluorescence around 675 nm is obtained only in red light (R)-irradiated spores and 2) in vitro measurements with acetone extracts prepared from homogenized spores.  Significant amounts of chlorophyll can be found only in R-treated spores; this chlorophyll exhibits an emission band around 668 nm, when irradiated with 430 nm light at 21 degrees C.  Compared to other criteria for germination, such as swelling of the cell, coat splitting, greening, and rhizoid formation, which require longer periods after induction for their expression, chlorophyll fluorescence can be used to quantify germination after two days.  This result is confirmed by fluence-response curves for R-induced spore germination; the same relationship between applied R and germination is obtained by the evaluation with the epifluorescence method 2 days after the light treatment as compared with the evaluation with bright-field microscopy 5 days after the inducing R.

Specifically, the blu mutants that lack blue light-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation were found to exhibit a normal phototropic response.  In contrast, a phototropic null mutant (JK218) and a mutant that has a 20- to 30-fold shift in the fluence dependence for first positive phototropism (JK224) showed normal inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in blue light.  F1 progeny of crosses between the blu mutants and JK218 showed normal phototropism and inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, and approximately 1 in 16 F2 progeny were double mutants lacking both responses.

Experiments were undertaken to identify the step in the pathway from gravity perception to asymmetric growth on which light may act.  Red light was effective in inducing gravitropism whether it was supplied concomitant with or as long as 30 minutes after the gravity stimulus (GS).  The presentation time was the same whether the GS was supplied in red light or in darkness.  Red light given before the GS slightly enhanced the rate of curvature but had little effect on the lag time or on the final curvature.  This enhancement was expanded by a delay between the red light pulse and the GS.  These results indicate that gravity perception and at least the initial transduction steps proceed in the dark.  Light may regulate the final growth (motor) phase of gravitropism.

Measurements of actual oxygen uptake rates were made for soybean and pea seeds as a comparison of short and long lived seeds when light, temperature, and moisture contents were varied.  In both peas and soybeans, the oxygen uptake was depressed at low temperatures (<16 degrees C) and low water contents (< 0.25 gram H2O per gram dry weight).  Apparent activation energies under these conditions are very high, while apparent activation energies of seeds at higher water contents and at temperatures greater than 22 degrees C are much less.  Light enhances the level of oxygen uptake in pea, but reduces the level of oxygen uptake in soybean.  The complexities of the interactions of oxygen uptake with environmental conditions in soybean compared to pea suggest that oxidative processes occur in soybean at low water contents, but are essentially absent in pea.

Germination was progressively stimulated by red light as seed hydration increased from 8 to 15%, and reached a maximum at moisture contents above 18%.  Red light was ineffective at moisture contents below 8%.  Seeds that had been stimulated by red light and subsequently dried lost the enhanced germinability if stored at moisture contents above 8%.  The contrast between the presumed photoconversion of phytochrome far red-absorbing (Pfr) to (Pr) occurring at any moisture content and the reverse reaction occurring only if the seed moisture content is greater than 8% may be explained on the basis of the existence of unstable intermediates in the Pr to Pfr conversion.

We have studied tropistic responses in roots as an example of these type of interactions. While gravitropism is the predominant tropistic response in roots, phototropism also plays a role in the oriented growth in this organ in flowering plants. In blue or white light, roots exhibit negative phototropism, but red light induces positive phototropism. In the flowering plant Arabidopsis, the photosensitive pigments phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) mediate this positive red-light-based photoresponse in roots since single mutants (and the double phyAB mutant) were severely impaired in this response. While blue-light-based negative phototropism is primarily mediated by the phototropin family of photoreceptors, the phyA and phyAB mutants (but not phyB) were inhibited in this response relative to the WT. The differences observed in phototropic responses were not due to growth limitations since the growth rates among all the mutants tested were not significantly different from that of the WT.

Based on the relative spectral sensitivities of desensitization and enhancement, these responses can be separated.  Desensitization is induced by blue light but not by red light.

Although these sand communities have not been exposed to the entire suite of Martian environmental conditions simultaneously, such communities can provide a useful model ecosystem for a potential extant Martian biota.","[{""volume"":""15"",""submissionId"":19950035182,""issue"":""3"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""3567bee64e2641c5a587616b88c2f9cd"",""publicationName"":""Life sciences and space research 24 (4): Planetary biology and origins of life; Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F (Meeting F3) of the COSPAR Plenary Meeting, 29th"",""publicationDate"":""1995-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":19950035152,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 24 (4): Planetary Biology and Origins of Life; Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F (Meeting F3) of the COSPAR Plenary Meeting, 29th, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""},{""id"":19950035152,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 24 (4): Planetary Biology and Origins of Life; Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F (Meeting F3) of the COSPAR Plenary Meeting, 29th, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19950035182
20040112179,REPRINT,The response of lazy-2 tomato seedlings to curvature-inducing magnetic gradients is modulated by light,"[""Hasenstein, K. H."",""Kuznetsov, O. A.""]","Shoots of the lazy-2 mutant of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Ailsa Craig) exhibit negative gravitropism in the dark, but respond positively gravitropically in (red) light. In order to test whether high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMFs) exert only ponderomotive effects on amyloplasts or affect other physiological processes, we induced magnetophoretic curvature in wild-type (WT) and lazy-2 mutant seedlings. Straight hypocotyls of 4-d-old plants were selected and the tips of their hooks were placed in an HGMF near the edge of a magnetized ferromagnetic wedge [grad (H2/2) approximately 10(9)-10(10) Oe2/cm] and mounted on a 1-rpm clinostat. After 4 h in the dark, 85% of WT hypocotyls and 67% of mutant hypocotyls curved toward the wedge. When the seedlings were exposed to red light for 1 h prior to and during the application of the HGMF, 78% of the WT seedlings curved toward the magnetic gradient, but the majority of the lazy-2 seedlings (75%) curved away from the stronger field area. Intracellular amyloplast displacement in the HGMF was similar for both varieties and resembled the displacement after horizontal reorientation. The WT showed a distinct graviresponse pattern depending on the orientation of the hook, even after excision of the apex. Application of HGMFs to decapitated hypocotyls resulted in curvature consistent with that obtained after horizontal reorientation. After light exposure, decapitated lazy-2 seedlings did not respond positively gravitropically. The data imply that the lazy-2 mutants perceive the displacement of amyloplasts in a similar manner to the WT and that the HGMF does not affect the graviresponse mechanism. The study demonstrates that ponderomotive forces due to HGMFs are useful for the analysis of the gravity-sensing mechanism in plants.","[{""volume"":""208"",""submissionId"":20040112179,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""0032-0935"",""id"":""658834b65fdf4a63b6c916665c47b46f"",""publicationName"":""Planta"",""publicationDate"":""1999-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG10-0190""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040112179

Short Gianotti "",""Jianzhi Dong"",""Isabel F. Trigo "",""Guido D. Salvucci "",""Dara Entekhabi""]","Vegetation cover creates competing effects on land surface temperature: it typically cools through enhancing energy dissipation and warms via decreasing surface albedo. Global  vegetation has been previously found to overall net cool land surfaces with cooling contributions from temperate and tropical vegetation and warming contributions from boreal vegetation. Recent studies suggest dryland vegetation across the tropics strongly contributes to this global net cooling feedback. However, observation-based vegetation-temperature interaction studies have been limited in the tropics, especially in their widespread drylands. Theoretical considerations also call into question the ability of dryland vegetation to strongly cool the surface under low water availability. Here, we use satellite observations to investigate how tropical vegetation cover influences the surface energy balance. We find that while increased vegetation cover would impart net cooling feedbacks across the tropics, net vegetal cooling effects are subdued in drylands. Using observations, we determine that dryland plants have less ability to cool the surface due to their cooling pathways being reduced by aridity, overall less efficient dissipation of turbulent energy, and their tendency to strongly increase solar radiation absorption. As a result, while proportional greening across the tropics would create an overall biophysical cooling feedback, dryland tropical vegetation reduces the overall tropical surface cooling 
magnitude by at least 14%, instead of enhancing cooling as suggested by previous global studies.

J.""]","Phytochrome-mediated germination of fern spores of Dryopteris paleacea Sw. was initiated by a saturating red-light (R) irradiation after 20 h of imbibition.  For its realization external Ca2+ was required, with a threshold at a submicromolar concentration, and an optimum was reached around 10(-4) M.  At concentrations > or = 10(-1) M only a reduced response was obtained, based probably on an unspecific osmotic or ionic effect.  The germination response was inhibited by La3+, an antagonist of Ca2+.  From these results it is concluded that Ca2+ influx from the medium into the spores may be an important event in phytochrome-mediated germination.  In the absence of Ca2+ the R-stimulated system remained capable of responding to Ca2+, added as late as 40 h after R.  Moreover, Ca2+ was effective even if added after the active form of phytochrome, Pfr, had been abolished by far-red (FR) 24 h after R.  Thus, the primary effect of Pfr, that initiates the transduction chain, does not require calcium.  ""Coupling"" of Pfr to subsequent dark reactions has been investigated by R-FR irradiations with various dark intervals.  The resulting ""escape kinetics"" were characterized by a lag phase (6 h) and half-maximal escape from FR reversibility (19 h).  These kinetics were not significantly changed by the presence or absence of calcium.  Thus, direct interaction of Pfr and calcium is not a step in the transduction chain initiated by the active form of phytochrome.","[{""volume"":""178"",""submissionId"":20040090330,""issn"":""0032-0935"",""id"":""7a228714194e42b0a7ca0dd6f0ff1f04"",""publicationName"":""Planta"",""publicationDate"":""1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090330

M.""]","Feedback lighting provides illumination primarily during the subjective night (i.e., the photosensitive portion of the circadian cycle) in response to a given behavior.  This technique has previously been used to test the nonparametric model of entrainment in nocturnal rodents.  In three species (Rattus norvegicus, Mesocricetus auratus, and Mus musculus), the free-running period of the locomotor activity rhythm was similar whether the animals were exposed to continuous light or discrete light pulses occurring essentially only during the subjective night (i.e., feedback lighting).  In the current experiments, feedback lighting was presented to squirrel monkeys so that light fell predominantly during the subjective night.  Feedback lighting was linked to the drinking behavior in this diurnal primate so that when the animal drank, the lights went out.  Despite the seemingly adverse predicament, the monkeys maintained regular circadian drinking rhythms.  Furthermore, just as the period of the free-running activity rhythms of nocturnal rodents exposed to continuous light or feedback lighting were similar, the period of the drinking rhythms of the squirrel monkeys in continuous light and feedback lighting were comparable (25.6 +/-  0.1 and 25.9 +/- 0.1 hours, respectively), despite a substantial decrease in the total amount of light exposure associated with feedback lighting.  The free-running period of monkeys exposed to continuous dark (24.5 +/- 0.1 hours) was significantly shorter than either of the two lighting conditions (P < 0.001). The results presented for the drinking rhythm were confirmed by examination of the temperature and activity rhythms.  Therefore, discrete light pulses given predominately during the subjective night are capable of simulating the effects of continuous light on the free-running period of the circadian rhythms of a diurnal primate.  The response of squirrel monkeys to feedback lighting thus lends further support for the model and suggests that the major entrainment mechanisms are similar in nocturnal rodents and diurnal primates.","[{""volume"":""15"",""submissionId"":20040089572,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0275-2565"",""id"":""b3b3f62a6bcd47b989a2bfe23e1b11ef"",""publicationName"":""American journal of primatology"",""publicationDate"":""1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089572

Slanted root growth always occurs to the right of the gravity vector when the root is viewed through the agar surface, and is not observed in the Columbia ecotype. Right-slanted root growth is surface-dependent and does not result directly from directional environmental stimuli or gradients in the plane of skewing. We have isolated two partially dominant mutations in WS (sku1 and sku2) that show an exaggerated right-slanting root-growth phenotype on agar surfaces. The right-slanting root-growth phenotype of wild-type and mutant roots is not the result of diagravitropism or of an alteration in root gravitropism. It is accompanied by a left-handed rotation of the root about its axis within the elongation zone, the rate of which positively correlates with the degree of right-slanted curvature. Our data suggest that the right-slanting root growth phenotype results from an endogenous structural asymmetry that expresses itself by a directional root-tip rotation.","[{""volume"":""111"",""submissionId"":20040173173,""issue"":""4"",""issn"":""0032-0889"",""id"":""f7bbd3391b7641dc98482f7525100690"",""publicationName"":""Plant physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1996-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""5-T32-6MO7133"",""RO1-GM48053""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040173173

Brief BL irradiations resulted in fast transient inhibition of elongation, while a delayed (lag  approximately 60 minutes) but  prolonged inhibition was observed after brief RL.  Possible changes in the hydraulic and wall properties of the growing cells during photoinhibition were examined.  Cell sap osmotic pressure was unaffected by BL and RL, but both irradiations increased turgor pressure by approximately 0.05 megapascal (pressure-probe technique).  Cell wall yielding was analyzed by in vivo stress relaxation (pressure-block technique).  BL and RL reduced the initial rate of relaxation by 38 and 54%, while the final amount of relaxation was decreased by 48 and 10%, respectively.  These results indicate that RL inhibits elongation mainly by lowering the wall yield coefficient, while most of the inhibitory effect of BL was due to an increase of the yield threshold.  Mechanical extensibility of cell walls  (Instron technique) was decreased by BL and RL, mainly due to a reduction in the plastic component of extensibility.  Thus, photoinhibitions of elongation by both BL and RL are achieved through changes in cell wall properties, and are not due to effects on the hydraulic properties of the cell.","[{""volume"":""95"",""submissionId"":20040090428,""issn"":""0032-0889"",""id"":""18a8e98906174d6ab8f9cdca650845ee"",""publicationName"":""Plant physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DE-0284ER13179""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090428

In this study immunoprecipitation techniques were used to characterize protein kinase activity associated with phytochrome from maize (Zea mays L.).  A protein kinase that specifically phosphorylated phytochrome was present in washed anti-phytochrome immunoprecipitates of etiolated coleoptile proteins.  No other substrate tested was phosphorylated by this kinase.  Adding salts or detergents to disrupt low-affinity protein interactions reduced background phosphorylation in immunoprecipitates without affecting phytochrome phosphorylation, indicating that the protein kinase catalytic activity is either intrinsic to the phytochrome molecule or associated with it by high-affinity interactions.  Red irradiation (of coleoptiles or extracts) sufficient to approach photoconversion saturation reduced phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated phytochrome.  Subsequent far-red irradiation reversed the red-light effect.  Phytochrome phosphorylation was stimulated about 10-fold by a co-immunoprecipitated factor.  The stimulatory factor was highest in immunoprecipitates when Mg2+ was present in immunoprecipitation reactions but remained in the supernatant in the absence of Mg2+.  These observations provide strong support for the hypothesis that phytochrome-associated protein kinase modulates light responses in vivo.

A.""]","During gravitropism, the accumulation of auxin in the lower side of the stem causes increased growth and the subsequent curvature, while the gaseous hormone ethylene plays a modulating role in regulating the kinetics of growth asymmetries. Light also contributes to the control of gravitropic curvature, potentially through its interaction with ethylene biosynthesis. In this study, red-light pulse treatment of etiolated pea epicotyls was evaluated for its effect on ethylene biosynthesis during gravitropic curvature. Ethylene biosynthesis analysis included measurements of ethylene; the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC); malonyl-conjugated ACC (MACC); and expression levels of pea ACC oxidase (Ps-ACO1) and ACC synthase (Ps-ACS1, Ps-ACS2) genes by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Red-pulsed seedlings were given a 6 min pulse of 11 micromoles m-2 s-1 red-light 15 h prior to horizontal reorientation for consistency with the timeline of red-light inhibition of ethylene production. Red-pulse treatment significantly reduced ethylene production and MACC levels in epicotyl tissue. However, there was no effect of red-pulse treatment on ACC level, or expression of ACS or ACO genes. During gravitropic curvature, ethylene production increased from 60 to 120 min after horizontal placement in both control and red-pulsed epicotyls. In red-pulsed tissues, ACC levels increased by 120 min after horizontal reorientation, accompanied by decreased MACC levels in the lower portion of the epicotyl. Overall, our results demonstrate that ethylene production in etiolated epicotyls increases after the initiation of curvature. This ethylene increase may inhibit cell growth in the lower portion of the epicotyl and contribute to tip straightening and reduced overall curvature observed after the initial 60 min of curvature in etiolated pea epicotyls.","[{""volume"":""43"",""submissionId"":20050164140,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0167-6903"",""id"":""f721237f91864dbaa7a67134ed6c804d"",""publicationName"":""Plant growth regulation"",""publicationDate"":""2004-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAGW-3859""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050164140

We examined this possibility by testing the relationship between calmodulin activity and gravitropic sensitivity in roots of the maize cultivars Merit and B73 x Missouri 17.  Roots of the Merit cultivar require light to the gravitropically competent.  The gravitropic response of the Missouri cultivar is independent of light.  The occurrence of calmodulin in primary roots of these maize cultivars was tested by affinity gel chromatography followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with bovine brain calmodulin as standard.  The distribution of calmodulin activity was measured using both the phosphodiesterase and NAD kinase assays for calmodulin.  These assays were performed on whole tissue segments, crude extracts, and purified extracts.  In light-grown seedlings of the Merit cultivar or in either dark- or light-grown seedlings of the Missouri cultivar, calmodulin activity per millimeter of root tissue was about 4-fold higher in the apical millimeter than in the subtending 3 millimeters.  Calmodulin activity was very low in the apical millimeter of roots of dark-grown (gravitropically nonresponsive) seedlings of the Merit cultivar.  Upon illumination, the calmodulin activity in the apical millimeter increased to a level comparable to that of light-grown seedlings and the roots became gravitropically competent.  The time course of the development of gravitropic sensitivity following illumination paralleled the time course of the increase in calmodulin activity in the apical millimeter of the root.

20040090108,REPRINT,Light-stimulated cell expansion in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) leaves.  I.  Growth can occur without photosynthesis,"[""Van Volkenburgh, E."",""Cleland, R. E.""]","Cell expansion in dicotyledonous leaves is strongly stimulated by bright white light (WL), at least in part as a result of light-induced acidification of the cell walls.  It has been proposed that photosynthetic reactions are required for light-stimulated transport processes across plasma membranes of leaf cells, including proton excretion.  The involvement of photosynthesis in growth and wall acidification of primary leaves of bean has been tested by inhibiting photosynthesis in two ways:  by reducing chlorophyll content of intact plants with tentoxin (TX) and by treating leaf discs with 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU).  Exposure to bright WL stimulated growth of intact leaves of TX-treated plants.  Discs excised from green as well as from TX-or DCMU-treated leaves also responded by growing faster in WL, as long as exogenous sucrose was supplied to the photosynthetically inhibited tissues.  The WL caused acidification of the epidermal surface of intact TX-leaves, but acidification of the incubation medium by mesophyll cells only occurred when photosynthesis was not inhibited.  It is concluded that light-stimulated cell enlargement of bean leaves, and the necessary acidification of epidermal cell walls, are mediated by a pigment other than chlorophyll.  Light-induced proton excretion by mesophyll cells, on the other hand, may require both a photosynthetic product (or exogenous sugars) and a non-photosynthetic light effect.","[{""volume"":""182"",""submissionId"":20040090108,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""0032-0935"",""id"":""5d3a29b96cce4646939fcf87ec99b48d"",""publicationName"":""Planta"",""publicationDate"":""1990-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090108
20040089573,REPRINT,Mechanism of rapid suppression of cell expansion in cucumber hypocotyls after blue-light irradiation,"[""Cosgrove, D. J.""]","Rapid suppression of hypocotyl elongation by blue light in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) was studied to examine possible hydraulic and wall changes responsible for diminished growth.  Cell-sap osmotic pressure, measured by vapor-pressure osmometry, was not decreased by blue light; turgor pressure, measured by the pressure-probe technique, remained constant during the growth inhibition; and stem hydraulic conductance, measured by dynamic and static methods, was likewise unaffected by blue light.  Wall yielding properties were assessed by the pressure-block technique for in-vivo stress relaxation.  Blue light reduced the initial rate of relaxation by 77%, but had little effect on the final amount of relaxation.  The results demonstrate that blue irradiation acts to decrease the wall yielding coefficient, but not the yield threshold.  Stress-strain (Instron) analysis showed that irradiation of the seedlings had little effect on the mechanical extensibilities of the isolated wall.  The results indicate that blue light can reduce cell-wall loosening without affecting bulk viscoelastic properties, and indicate a chemorheological mechanism of cell-wall expansion.","[{""volume"":""176"",""submissionId"":20040089573,""issn"":""0032-0935"",""id"":""75bceecfc55245449a36ab129baa3b0a"",""publicationName"":""Planta"",""publicationDate"":""1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DMB-8351030""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089573

Heynh. have been identified with altered phototropic responses to 450-nm light.  Four of these mutants have been more thoroughly characterized.  Strain JK224 shows normal gravitropism and ""second positive"" phototropism.  However, while the amplitude for ""first positive"" phototropism  is the same as that in the wild-type, the threshold and fluence for the maximum response in ""first positive"" phototropism are shifted to higher fluence by a factor of 20-30.  This mutant may represent an alteration in the photoreceptor pigment for phototropism.  Strain JK218 exhibits no curvature to light at any fluence from 1 micromole m-2 to 2700 micromoles m-2, but shows normal gravitropism.  Strain JK345 shows no ""first positive"" phototropism, and reduced gravitropism and ""second positive"" phototropism.  Strain JK229 shows no measurable ""first positive"" phototropism, but normal gravitropism and ""second positive"" phototropism.  Based on these data, it is suggested that: 1. gravitropism and phototropism contain at least one common element; 2.

J.""]","Light, through the mediation of the pigment phytochrome, modulates the gravitropic response of the shoots and roots of many plants.  The transduction of both light and gravity stimuli appears to involve Ca(2+)-regulated steps, one or more of which may represent points of intersection between the two transduction chains.  To be confident that Ca2+ plays a critical role in stimulus-response coupling for gravitropism, it will be important to identify specific targets of Ca2+ action whose function can be clearly linked to the regulation of growth.  Calcium typically exerts its influence on cell metabolism through binding to and activating key regulatory proteins.  The three best characterized of these proteins in plants are the calmodulins, calcium-dependent protein kinases, and annexins.  In this review we summarize what is known about the structure and function of these proteins and speculate on how their activation by Ca2+ could influence the differential growth response of gravitropism.","[{""volume"":""8"",""submissionId"":20040090015,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0898-4697"",""id"":""a43027fa84cd42a78e3fa6cde2b0bd48"",""publicationName"":""ASGSB bulletin :  publication of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""publicationDate"":""1995-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DCB 91-06245"",""NAGW-1519""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090015

Prior to the growth suppression, the plasma-membrane of the irradiated cells depolarized by as much as 100 mV, then returned within 2-3 min to near its initial value.  The potential difference measured with surface electrodes changed with an identical time course but opposite polarity.  The lag time for the change in surface potential showed an inverse dependence on fluence rate, similar to the lag for the growth inhibition.  Green light and red light caused neither the electrical response nor the rapid inhibition of growth.  The depolarization by BL did not propagate to nonirradiated regions and exhibited a refractory period of about 10 min following a BL pulse.  Fluence-response relationships for the electrical and growth responses provide correlational evidence that the plasma-membrane depolarization reflects an event in the transduction chain of this light-growth response.","[{""volume"":""178"",""submissionId"":20040090328,""issn"":""0032-0935"",""id"":""d7353f67c1e34d92bbf7c7dbb4980100"",""publicationName"":""Planta"",""publicationDate"":""1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DMB-8351030""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090328

L.""]","The lz-2 mutation in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) causes conditional reversal of shoot gravitropism by light. This response is mediated by phytochrome. To further elicit the mechanism by which phytochrome regulates the lz-2 phenotype, phytochrome-deficient lz-2 plants were generated. Introduction of au alleles, which severely block chromophore biosynthesis, eliminated the reversal of hypocotyl gravitropism in continuous red and far-red light. The fri1 and tri1 alleles were introduced to specifically deplete phytochromes A and B1, respectively. In dark-grown seedlings, phytochrome A was necessary for response to high-irradiance far-red light, a complete response to low fluence red light, and also mediated the effects of blue light in a far-red reversible manner. Loss of phytochrome B1 alone did not significantly affect the behaviour of lz-2 plants under any light treatment tested. However, dark-grown lz-2 plants lacking both phytochrome A and B1 exhibited reduced responses to continuous red and were less responsive to low fluence red light and high fluence blue light than plants that were deficient for phytochrome A alone. In high light, full spectrum greenhouse conditions, lz-2 plants grew downward regardless of the phytochrome deficiency. These results indicate that phytochromes A and B1 play significant roles in mediating the lz-2 phenotype and that at least one additional phytochrome is involved in reversing shoot gravitropism in this mutant.","[{""volume"":""22"",""submissionId"":20040089038,""issue"":""5"",""issn"":""0140-7791"",""id"":""b26665ee983c4310ab99d72ca5631f2b"",""publicationName"":""Plant, cell & environment"",""publicationDate"":""1999-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG5-6373""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089038

In an effort to characterize the orthogravitropic transduction system, comparative experiments have been carried out on the effects of red light, calcium, and abscisic acid (ABA).  The red light effect can be completely satisfied with added ABA (100 micromolar) or with osmotic shock, which is presumed to increase endogenous ABA.  The decay of the red light effect is closely paralleled by the decay of the ABA effect.  ABA and exogenous calcium show strong additive effects when applied to either Merit or a line of corn which does not require red light for orthogravitropism.  Measurements of the ABA content show marked increases in endogenous ABA in the growing region of the roots after red light.

Here we examine the effects of the three growth promoters on the osmotic potential difference (delta Psi), the accumulation of solutes (delta TSC), the wall yield threshold (Y) and the growth potential (delta Psi -Y).  With GA3 and BA, but not WL, there was a rapid decline in delta Psi as measured by the osmotic concentration of expressed sap.  Unlike WL, neither GA3 nor BA promoted the accumulation of osmotic solutes.  The decline in delta Psi, however, was apparently counteracted by a decline in Y since the growth potential, as measured by the external-osmoticum method, remained unchanged.

As measured by a quantitative immunoassay, phytochrome also promotes rapid and opposite changes in the extractable content of a Mr 98,000 anionic isoperoxidase in the cell walls of these same organs: it induces a decrease of this peroxidase in coleoptiles and an increase in mesocotyls.  The peroxidase changes precede the growth changes.  As measured by video stereomicroscopy or a position transducer, red light (R), which photoactivates phytochrome, stimulates coleoptile elongation with a lag of about 15-20 min and suppresses mesocotyl growth with a lag of 45-50 min.  R also induces a 50% reduction in the extractable level of the anionic peroxidase in coleoptile walls in less than 10 min and a 40% increase in the level of this peroxidase in mesocotyl walls within 30 min.  Ascorbic acid, an inhibitor of peroxidase activity, blocks the effects of R on mesocotyl section growth.

To test whether this could be due, at least in part, to an increase in plasma membrane (PM) ATPase activity, PM vesicles were isolated from primary leaves by phase partitioning and used to characterize PM ATPase activity and changes in response to light.  ATPase activity was characterized as magnesium ion dependent, vanadate sensitive, and slightly stimulated by potassium chloride.  The pH optimum was 6.5, the Km was approximately 0.30 millimolar ATP, and the activity was about 60% latent.  PM vesicles were prepared from leaves of plants grown for 11 days in dim red light (growing slowly) or grown for 10 days in dim red light and then transferred to bright white-light for 1 day (growing rapidly).  For both light treatments, ATPase specific activity was approximately 600 to 700 nanomoles per milligram protein per minute, and the latency, Km, and sensitivity to potassium chloride were also similar.  PM vesicles from plants grown in complete darkness, however, exhibited a twofold greater specific activity.  We conclude that the promotion of leaf growth and proton excretion by bright white light is not due to an increase in ATPase specific activity.  Light does influence ATPase activity, however; both dim red light and bright white light decreased the ATPase specific activity by nearly 50% as compared with dark-grown leaves.","[{""volume"":""94"",""submissionId"":20040090439,""issn"":""0032-0889"",""id"":""1194a68903eb44dab1e7b43f2a498428"",""publicationName"":""Plant physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DCB-8517349""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090439

GeneLab has also recently implemented an effort to present processed data in the GLDS in addition to the raw omics data. The processed data will enable interpretation of the data by a larger group of students, scientists and the general public. Standard pipelines for the transformation of raw data into visualizations were developed by four GeneLab Analysis Working Groups (animals, plants, microbes, multi-omics) comprised of over 100 scientists from NASA and academia. These pipelines are now being used by a group of bioinformatics interns to provide standard basic analysis of the data for incorporation into GLDS.","[{""submissionId"":20190033139,""id"":""3e5ec6860d014bb3add3cb3cf5643c4a"",""publicationDate"":""2019-11-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190033139,""name"":""Advances in Genome Biology and Technology"",""location"":""San Francisco, CA"",""id"":""36c4ced08b5b4c88a1de07197388b289"",""startDate"":""2019-11-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190033139
20040090359,REPRINT,Time-lapse analysis of gravitropism in Ceratodon protonemata,"[""Young, J. C."",""Sack, F. D.""]","The tip cell of the protonema of the moss Ceratodon purpureus (Hedw.) Brid. is negatively gravitropic when grown in the dark on supplemented agar.  Gravitropism, plastid distribution, and plastid movement were studied in living cells using time-lapse video microscopy and infrared light.  A wrong-way (downward) curvature preceded upward curvature and was detected as early as 2 minutes after reorientation.  Upward curvature began 30-45 minutes after reorientation to the horizontal.  Cell division temporarily reversed upward curvature, but did not inhibit wrong-way curvature.  Since significant amyloplast sedimentation always occurred before the start of upward curvature, it is possible that these amyloplasts function as statoliths for upward curvature.  However, no significant amyloplast sedimentation occurred before wrong-way curvature.  Thus, this early phase of gravitropism cannot require plastid sedimentation for gravity sensing.  Most plastids moved within and between zones, and plastid zonation was highly dynamic.  Plastids moved toward the apex and toward the base of the cell at rates much slower than cytoplasmic streaming.  Despite the dynamic nature of plastid movement and zonation, during upward curvature the distance between sedimented plastids and the apex stayed constant.  Time-lapse analysis has revealed intriguing events not readily seen previously using destructive sampling.","[{""volume"":""79"",""submissionId"":20040090359,""issue"":""12"",""issn"":""0002-9122"",""id"":""df1b845fa5624996917c05e3a79f9213"",""publicationName"":""American journal of botany"",""publicationDate"":""1992-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG10-0085"",""NAGW-780""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090359
20040090231,REPRINT,Physiological asymmetry in etiolated pea epicotyls:  relation to patterns of auxin distribution and phototropic behavior,"[""Kuhn, H."",""Galston, A. W.""]","Etiolated pea seedlings require transformation of Pr phytochrome to Pfr before they display optimal phototropic response to unilateral blue light.  This study investigates the possible role of auxin transport in explaining these phenomena.  Labeled [2-14C]IAA applied to the intact terminal buds of dark-grown and red light-treated pea seedlings was measured 210 min later on the shaded and illuminated sides of the epicotyl as a function of direction and duration of irradiation with blue light.  Totally darkened epicotyls show an asymmetry in distribution of radioactivity in the upper growth zone of the epicotyl, in favor of the side under the concave part of the apical hook.  Red light, which greatly potentiates curvature toward subsequent unilateral blue light, lowers this asymmetry.  Blue light directed to the epicotyl of red-pretreated plants in a plane parallel to the hook and from the side bearing the convex portion of the hook induces positive phototropic curvature as well as a surplus of radioactivity on the illuminated side of the upper epicotyl and on the shaded side of the lower growth zone of the epicotyl.  Light directed to the side bearing the concave part of the hook also causes an accumulation of counts in the upper part of the lighted side but produces neither curvature of the epicotyl nor accumulation of counts in the lower shaded side.  Because of this built-in physiological asymmetry in the growth zone just below the apical hook, it is difficult to explain the effects of red and blue light on curvature in terms of patterns of auxin distribution alone.","[{""volume"":""55"",""submissionId"":20040090231,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0031-8655"",""id"":""ad37636354b04a92aa08640018d46cdb"",""publicationName"":""Photochemistry and photobiology"",""publicationDate"":""1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NSG-7290""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090231

S.""]","The world's first extravehicular activity (EVA) was performed by A. A. Leonov on March 18, 1965 during the Russian Voskhod-2 mission. The first US EVA was executed by Gemini IV astronaut Ed White on June 3, 1965, with an umbilical tether that included communications and an oxygen supply. A hand-held maneuvering unit (HHMU) also was used to test maneuverability during the brief EVA; however the somewhat stiff umbilical limited controlled movement. That constraint, plus difficulty returning through the vehicle hatch, highlighted the need for increased thermal control and improved EVA ergonomics. Clearly, requirements for a useful EVA were interrelated with the vehicle design. The early Gemini EVAs generated requirements for suits providing micro-meteor protection, adequate visual field and eye protection from solar visual and infrared radiation, gloves optimized for dexterity while pressurized, and thermal systems capable of protecting the astronaut while rejecting metabolic heat during high workloads. Subsequent Gemini EVAs built upon this early experience and included development of a portable environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) and an astronaut maneuvering unit. The ECLSS provided a pressure vessel and controller with functional control over suit pressure, oxygen flow, carbon dioxide removal, humidity, and temperature control. Gemini EVA experience also identified the usefulness of underwater neutral buoyancy and altitude chamber task training, and the importance of developing reliable task timelines. Improved thermal management and carbon dioxide control also were required for high workload tasks. With the Apollo project, EVA activity was primarily on the lunar surface; and suit durability, integrated liquid cooling garments, and low suit operating pressures (3.75 pounds per square inch absolute [psia] or 25.8 kilopascal [kPa],) were required to facilitate longer EVAs with ambulation and significant physical workloads with average metabolic rates of 1000 BTU/hr and peaks of up to 2200 BTU/hr. Mobility was further augmented with the Lunar Roving Vehicle. The Apollo extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) was made up of over 15 components, ranging from a biomedical belt for capturing and transmitting biomedical data, urine and fecal containment systems, a liquid cooling garment, communications cap, a modular portable life support system (PLSS), a boot system, thermal overgloves, and a bubble helmet with eye protection. Apollo lunar astronauts performed successful EVAs on the lunar surface from a 5 psia (34.4 kPa) 100% oxygen environment in the Lunar Lander. A maximum of three EVAs were performed on any mission. For Skylab a modified A7LB suit, used for Apollo 15, was selected. The Skylab astronaut life support assembly (ALSA) provided umbilical support through the life support umbilical (LSU) and used open loop oxygen flow, rather than closed-loop as in Apollo missions. Thermal control was provided by liquid water circulated by spacecraft pumps and electrical power also was provided from the spacecraft via the umbilical. The cabin atmosphere of 5 psia (34.4 kPa), 70% oxygen, provided a normoxic atmosphere and because of the very low nitrogen partial pressures, no special protocols were required to protect against decompression sickness (DCS) as was the case with the Apollo spacecraft with a 5 psi, 100% oxygen environment.","[{""submissionId"":20080000344,""id"":""6ee1363100374940a36ebcf80d7faa0d"",""publicationDate"":""2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080000344

Thus, creative use of the resources available in situ could reduce mission costs and extend the scope of such activities. To that end, we are developing synthetic fungal strains to produce specialized materials from the resources found throughout the solar system. A primary goal is to develop a suite of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains to serve as generic production chassis for synthetic metabolic pathways. These strains must perform consistently upon challenge by unique conditions including exposure to microgravity, cosmic radiation, the rigors of launch and re-entry, and long-term stasis. Presently, we are establishing systematic datasets profiling epigenetic, transcriptional, translational and metabolic states of S. cerevisiae under relevant operating conditions. These will deepen our understanding of the physiological changes associated with space travel and enable rational engineering of optimal production strains.","[{""submissionId"":20190028856,""id"":""24b4b26913f047778bf8e973019c3048"",""publicationDate"":""2015-06-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190028856,""name"":""Gordon Research Conferences"",""location"":""Newry, ME, United States"",""id"":""544e3b6eda534c9989085c45114a1ce0""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190028856,""endDate"":""2015-07-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Gordon Research Conferences"",""location"":""Newry, ME, United States""}},""meetingId"":""0cbb885bb9d24b4aa80f9c91f3830695"",""id"":""24271fdc6e184c3e95ea3c2333af92ae""}],""name"":""2015 Gordon Research Conference on Synthetic Biology: Advancing Biosystems Design"",""location"":""Newry, ME"",""id"":""0cbb885bb9d24b4aa80f9c91f3830695"",""startDate"":""2015-06-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNH06CC03B""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190028856

In the maize cultivar Merit, we investigated phytochrome-mediated events in the cap.  We established that the message encoded by the phyA1 gene was most abundant in dark-grown tissue and was asymmetrically distributed in the root cap, with greatest expression in the cells which make up the central columella core of the cap.  Phytochrome message was negatively autoregulated in a specific region within the root cap.  This autoregulation was sensitive to very-low-fluence red light, and thus was characterized as a phytochrome-mediated, very-low-fluence event.  The kinetics of message reaccumulation in the dark were also examined and compared to the kinetics of the light requirement for root gravitropism in this cultivar.  Similarly, the degree of autoregulation present in two other maize cultivars with different light requirements for gravitropic sensitivity was investigated.  It appears that the Merit cultivar expresses a condition of hypersensitivity to phytochrome-mediated light regulation in root tissues.  We conclude that phytochrome regulates many activities within the cap, but the degree to which these activities share common phytochrome-mediated steps is not known.","[{""volume"":""95"",""submissionId"":20040090426,""issn"":""0032-0889"",""id"":""a71a9abb886b4dd9865861c714f1b767"",""publicationName"":""Plant physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090426

The magnitude of increase in the light gradient is dependent solely on the light-absorbing qualities of the stain used.  Metanil yellow has no effect on the axial red-light gradient, while methylene blue causes a large increase in this light gradient.  These stains did not affect growth in darkness or the sensitivity of mesocotyl elongation to red light.  However, mesocotyl elongation was altered for the dark-grown seedlings stained with methylene blue when these seedlings were transplanted, covered with soil, and permitted to emerge under natural lighting conditions.  These observations are consistent with the idea that there is a single perceptive site below the coleoptilar node, and suggest that this perceptive site gives the actinic light which has traveled downward through the length of the shoot from an entry point in the plant tip region.","[{""volume"":""81"",""submissionId"":20040089991,""issn"":""0032-0889"",""id"":""af0708c0411446f58c160b7bfcba10f4"",""publicationName"":""Plant physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1986-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DE-AC02-76ERO-1338""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089991

In the present study, effects of the listed stresses on abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and isopentenyl adenosine ([9R]iP) levels in roots and leaves of plants grown under otherwise near optimal conditions on earth were measured. Hormones were extracted, purified by HPLC, and quantified by noncompetitive indirect ELISA. In response to water deficit, ABA levels increased in roots and leaves, IAA levels decreased in roots and leaves, and [9R]iP levels increased in leaves but decreased in roots. In response to waterlogging, ABA, IAA and [9R]iP levels briefly increased in roots and leaves and then decreased. When portions of the root system were exposed to waterlogging and/or water deficit, ABA levels in leaves increased while [9R]iP and IAA levels decreased. These responses were correlated with the percentage of the root system stressed.

20040090210,REPRINT,Nocturnal illumination maintains reproductive function and simulates the period-lengthening effect of constant light in the mature male Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus),"[""Ferraro, J. S.""]","Mature male Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) were placed in individual light-tight, sound attenuated chambers and exposed to one of four lighting conditions for a duration of approximately seven weeks.  The four lighting conditions were:  constant light (LL); constant dark (DD); feedback lighting (LDFB; a condition that illuminates the cage in response to locomotor activity); or a feedback lighting neighbor control (LDFB NC; the animal receives the same light pattern as a paired animal in feedback lighting, but has no control over it).  Exposure of hamsters to LL or LDFB produced significantly and similarly longer free-running periods of the locomotor activity rhythm than exposure of animals to DD.  Hamsters exposed to LDFB NC did not free-run or entrain, but rather displayed ""relative coordination"".  The paired testes and sex accessory glands weights suggest that in the Djungarian hamster, LL and LDFB exposed animals maintained reproductive function, whereas DD exposed animals did not.  Animals exposed to LDFB NC had intermediate paired testes weights.  Since several previous studies have demonstrated that short pulses of light, which are coincident with the subjective night, are photostimulatory, it is not surprising that LDFB maintained reproductive function in the mature Djungarian hamster.  Feedback lighting, however, has been shown to be an insufficient stimulus to maintain reproductive function of mature male and female Syrian hamsters, and to the reproductive maturation of immature Djungarian hamsters.  The results suggest that there may be slight, but significant differences in the way these two species interpret photoperiod, as well as a developmental change in the photoperiodic response of Djungarian hamsters.","[{""volume"":""21"",""submissionId"":20040090210,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""0022-1945"",""id"":""931879f7d50e4af18dfb9a5f621d5edb"",""publicationName"":""Journal of interdisciplinary cycle research"",""publicationDate"":""1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NS23138""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090210

S."",""Lamerson, P. M."",""Evans, M. L."",""Cohen, J. D.""]","We examined the changes in the levels of indoleacetic acid (IAA), IAA esters, and a 22-kilodalton subunit auxin-binding protein (ABP1) in apical mesocotyl tissue of maize (Zea mays L.) during continuous red light (R) irradiation.  These changes were compared with the kinetics of R-induced growth inhibition in the same tissue.  Upon the onset of continuous irradiation, growth decreased in a continuous manner following a brief lag period.  The decrease in growth continued for 5 hours, then remained constant at 25% of the dark rate.  The abundance of ABP1 and the level of free IAA both decreased in the mesocotyl.  Only the kinetics of the decrease in IAA within the apical mesocotyl correlated with the initial change in growth, although growth continued to decrease even after IAA content reached its final level, 50% of the dark control.  This decrease in IAA within the mesocotyl probably occurs primarily by a change in its transport within the shoot since auxin applied as a pulse move basipetally in R-irradiated tissue at the same rate but with half the area as dark control tissue.  In situ localization of auxin in etiolated maize shoots revealed that R-irradiated shoots contained less auxin in the epidermis than the dark controls.  Irradiated mesocotyl grew 50% less than the dark controls even when incubated in an optimal level of auxin.  However, irradiated and dark tissue contained essentially the same amount of radioactivity after incubation in [14C]IAA indicating that the light treatment does not affect the uptake into the tissue through the cut end, although it is possible that a small subset of cells within the mesocotyl is affected.  These observations support the hypothesis that R causes a decrease in the level of auxin in epidermal cells of the mesocotyl, consequently constraining the growth of the entire mesocotyl.","[{""volume"":""97"",""submissionId"":20040090061,""issn"":""0032-0889"",""id"":""1ee1dc5cc0a6401b899ea633c58c8d15"",""publicationName"":""Plant physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DCB-8917378"",""NAGW-297"",""90-01579""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090061

Their lack of self-supporting tissues and their vertical position on top of the canopy make them strong competitors of resources. A few pioneer studies have shown that liana optical traits differ on average from those of colocated trees. Those trait discrepancies were hypothesized to be responsible for the competitive advantage of lianas over trees. Yet, in the absence of reliable modelling tools, it is impossible to unravel their impact on the forest energy balance, light competition, and on the liana success in Neotropical forests. To bridge this gap, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature to gather all published liana leaf optical spectra, as well as all canopy spectra measured over different levels of liana infestation. We then used a Bayesian data assimilation framework applied to two radiative transfer models (RTMs) covering the leaf and canopy scales to derive tropical tree and liana trait distributions, which finally informed a full dynamic vegetation model. According to the RTMs inversion, lianas grew thinner, more horizontal leaves with lower pigment concentrations. Those traits made the lianas very efficient at light interception and significantly modified the forest energy balance and its carbon cycle. While forest albedo increased by 14% in the shortwave, light availability was reduced in the understorey (−30% of the PAR radiation) and soil temperature decreased by 0.5°C. Those liana-specific traits were also responsible for a significant reduction of tree (−19%) and ecosystem (−7%) gross primary productivity (GPP) while lianas benefited from them (their GPP increased by +27%). This study provides a novel mechanistic explanation to the increase in liana abundance, new evidence of the impact of lianas on forest functioning, and paves the way for the evaluation of the large-scale impacts of lianas on forest biogeochemical cycles.","[{""volume"":""28"",""submissionId"":20220002048,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""1354-1013"",""publisher"":""Wiley"",""eissn"":""1365-2486"",""id"":""181b1d1c3ab04c8d8bc57e77bbdf073e"",""publicationName"":""Global Change Biology"",""publicationDate"":""2021-10-15T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""issuePublicationDate"":""2022-01-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""doi"":"" 10.1111/gcb.15928""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""304029.01.24.01.11"",""J-090016"",""637643 (TREECLIMBERS)"",""fellowship 1214720N"",""NSF ABI 1458021""]",undefined,"[""Earth Resources And Remote Sensing""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220002048

We are using the spectacular underground landscapes of Earth caves as models for the subsurfaces of other planets. Caves have been detected on the Moon and Mars and are strongly suspected for other bodies in the Solar System including some of the ice covered Ocean Worlds that orbit gas giant planets. The caves we explore and study include many extreme conditions of relevance to planetary astrobiology exploration including high and low temperatures, gas atmospheres poisonous to humans but where exotic microbes can fluorish, highly acidic or salty fluids, heavy metals, and high background radiation levels.

J.""]","A large, transient depolarization of the plasma membrane precedes the rapid blue-light (BL)-induced growth suppression in etiolated seedlings of Cucumis sativus L.  The mechanism of this voltage transient was investigated by applying inhibitors of ion channels and the plasma-membrane H(+)-ATPase, by manipulating extracellular ion concentrations, and by measuring cell input resistance and ATP levels.  The depolarizing phase was not affected by Ca(2+)-channel blockers (verapamil, La3+) or by reducing extracellular free Ca2+ by treatment with ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA).  However, these treatments did reduce the rate of repolarization, indicating an inward movement of Ca2+ is involved.  No effects of the K(+)-channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA+) were detected.  Vanadate and KCN, used to inhibit the H(+)-ATPase, reduced or completely inhibited the BL-induced depolarization.  Levels of ATP increased by 11-26% after 1-2 min of BL.  Input resistance of trichrome cells, measured with double-barreled microelectrodes, remained constant during the onset of the depolarization but decreased as the membrane voltage became more positive than -90 mV.  The results indicate that the depolarization mechanism initially involves inactivation of the H(+)-ATPase with subsequent transient activation of one or more types of ion channels.","[{""volume"":""188"",""submissionId"":20040089511,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0032-0935"",""id"":""cf64d5d8fa914844861f23a64c3d4284"",""publicationName"":""Planta"",""publicationDate"":""1992-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DMB-8351030""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089511

Global vegetation has been previously found to overall net cool land surfaces with cooling contributions from temperate and tropical vegetation and warming contributions from boreal vegetation. Recent studies suggest dryland vegetation across the tropics strongly contributes to this global net cooling feedback. However, observation-based vegetation-temperature interaction studies have been limited in the tropics, especially in their widespread drylands. Theoretical considerations also call into question the ability of dryland vegetation to strongly cool the surface under low water availability. Here, we use satellite observations to investigate how tropical vegetation cover influences the surface energy balance. We find that while increased vegetation cover would impart net cooling feedbacks across the tropics, net vegetal cooling effects are subdued in drylands. Using observations, we determine that dryland plants have less ability to cool the surface due to their cooling pathways being reduced by aridity, overall less efficient dissipation of turbulent energy, and their tendency to strongly increase solar radiation absorption. As a result, while proportional greening across the tropics would create an overall biophysical cooling feedback, dryland tropical vegetation reduces the overall tropical surface cooling magnitude by at least 14%, instead of enhancing cooling as suggested by previous global studies.","[{""volume"":""29"",""submissionId"":20230009424,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""1354-1013"",""publisher"":""Wiley"",""eissn"":""1365-2486"",""id"":""1361f961e09b444fa451eddff88d544d"",""publicationName"":""Global Change Biology"",""publicationDate"":""2022-09-28T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""issuePublicationDate"":""2023-01-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""doi"":""10.1111/gcb.16455""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""80HQTR21CA005"",""80NSSC23M0011"",""1510842""]",undefined,"[""Earth Resources and Remote Sensing""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230009424
20010056494,CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS,Workshop on Science and the Human Exploration of Mars,"[""Duke, M. B.""]","The exploration of Mars will be a multi-decadal activity. Currently, a scientific program is underway, sponsored by NASA's Office of Space Science in the United States, in collaboration with international partners France, Italy, and the European Space Agency. Plans exist for the continuation of this robotic program through the first automated return of Martian samples in 2014. Mars is also a prime long-term objective for human exploration, and within NASA, efforts are being made to provide the best integration of the robotic program and future human exploration missions. From the perspective of human exploration missions, it is important to understand the scientific objectives of human missions, in order to design the appropriate systems, tools, and operational capabilities to maximize science on those missions. In addition, data from the robotic missions can provide critical environmental data - surface morphology, materials composition, evaluations of potential toxicity of surface materials, radiation, electrical and other physical properties of the Martian environment, and assessments of the probability that humans would encounter Martian life forms. Understanding of the data needs can lead to the definition of experiments that can be done in the near-term that will make the design of human missions more effective. This workshop was convened to begin a dialog between the scientific community that is central to the robotic exploration mission program and a set of experts in systems and technologies that are critical to human exploration missions. The charge to the workshop was to develop an understanding of the types of scientific exploration that would be best suited to the human exploration missions and the capabilities and limitations of human explorers in undertaking science on those missions.","[{""submissionId"":20010056494,""id"":""e45c0e391a4c4149b1dc890a7b8216e3"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20010056494,""endDate"":""2001-01-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""697190f09e5f40b998191aef885b444c"",""id"":""3d8f85cd4348453b995be3e34aa86b3e""}],""name"":""Workshop on Science and the Human Exploration of Mars"",""location"":""Greenbelt, MD"",""id"":""697190f09e5f40b998191aef885b444c"",""startDate"":""2001-01-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NASW-4574""]",undefined,"[""Lunar And Planetary Science And Exploration""]","[{""id"":20010056499,""title"":""Science and the Human Exploration of Mars: Risks to the Crew on the Surface""},{""id"":20010056510,""title"":""Astrobiology Sample Analysis as a Design Driver""},{""id"":20010056504,""title"":""Analog Studies in Preparation for Human Exploration of Mars""},{""id"":20010056506,""title"":""Mars Field Geology, Biology and Paleontology Workshop: Consensus, Recommendations and Progress""},{""id"":20010056505,""title"":""Linking Human and Robotic Missions: Early Leveraging of the Code S Missions""},{""id"":20010056497,""title"":""Mars Climate: Science Opportunities and Operational Dependence for Human Explorers""},{""id"":20010056501,""title"":""Robot and Human Surface Operations on Solar System Bodies""},{""id"":20010056495,""title"":""Relative Roles of Robots and Humans in the Exploration of Mars""},{""id"":20010056500,""title"":""EVA Considerations""},{""id"":20010056502,""title"":""Human Mars Mission Contamination Issues""},{""id"":20010056495,""title"":""Relative Roles of Robots and Humans in the Exploration of Mars""},{""id"":20010056497,""title"":""Mars Climate: Science Opportunities and Operational Dependence for Human Explorers""},{""id"":20010056499,""title"":""Science and the Human Exploration of Mars: Risks to the Crew on the Surface""},{""id"":20010056500,""title"":""EVA Considerations""},{""id"":20010056501,""title"":""Robot and Human Surface Operations on Solar System Bodies""},{""id"":20010056502,""title"":""Human Mars Mission Contamination Issues""},{""id"":20010056504,""title"":""Analog Studies in Preparation for Human Exploration of Mars""},{""id"":20010056505,""title"":""Linking Human and Robotic Missions: Early Leveraging of the Code S Missions""},{""id"":20010056506,""title"":""Mars Field Geology, Biology and Paleontology Workshop: Consensus, Recommendations and Progress""},{""id"":20010056510,""title"":""Astrobiology Sample Analysis as a Design Driver""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20010056494

J.""]","Neutral naphthalene (C10H8), phenanthrene (C14H10), and pyrene (C16H10) absorb strongly in the ultraviolet and may contribute to the extinction curve. High abundances are required to produce detectable structures. The cations of these Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) absorb in the visible. C10H8(+) has 12 discrete absorption bands which fall between 6800 and 5000 A. The strongest band at 6741 A falls close to the weak 6742 A diffuse interstellar band (DIB). Five other weaker bands also match DIBs. The possibility that C10H8(+) is responsible for some of the DIBs can be tested by searching for new DIBS at 6520, 6151, and 5965 A, other moderately strong naphthalene cation band positions. If C10H8(+) is indeed responsible for the 6742 A feature, it accounts for 0.3% of the cosmic carbon. The spectrum of C16H10(+) is dominated by a strong band at 4435 A in an Ar matrix and 4395 A in a Ne matrix, a position which falls very close to the strongest DIB, that at 4430 A. If C16H10(+), or a closely related pyrene-like ion is indeed responsible for the 4430 A feature, it accounts for 0.2% of the cosmic carbon. We also report an intense, very broad UV-to-visible continuum which is associated with both ions and could explain how PAHs convert interstellar UV and visible radiation into IR.","[{""volume"":""15"",""submissionId"":19950035205,""issue"":""3"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""d8aa6016f11541ababe336602287c1f9"",""publicationName"":""Life sciences and space research 24 (4): Planetary biology and origins of life; Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F (Meeting F3) of the COSPAR Plenary Meeting, 29th"",""publicationDate"":""1995-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":19950035152,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 24 (4): Planetary Biology and Origins of Life; Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F (Meeting F3) of the COSPAR Plenary Meeting, 29th, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""},{""id"":19950035152,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 24 (4): Planetary Biology and Origins of Life; Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F (Meeting F3) of the COSPAR Plenary Meeting, 29th, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19950035205

At NASA's Ames Research Center, this endeavor encompasses the use of space to understand life's origin, evolution, and destiny in the universe. Life's origin refers to understanding the origin of life in the context of the origin and diversity of planetary systems. Life's evolution refers to understanding how living systems have adapted to Earth's changing environment, to the all-pervasive force of gravity, and how they may adapt to environments beyond Earth. Life's destiny refers to making long-term human presence in space a reality, and laying the foundation for understanding and managing changes in Earth's environment. The first Astrobiology Workshop brought together a diverse group of researchers to discuss the following general questions: Where and how are other habitable worlds formed? How does life originate? How have the Earth and its biosphere influenced each other over time? Can terrestrial life be sustained beyond our planet? How can we expand the human presence to Mars? The objectives of the Workshop included: discussing the scope of astrobiology, strengthening existing efforts for the study of life in the universe, identifying new cross-disciplinary programs with the greatest potential for scientific return, and suggesting steps needed to bring this program to reality. Ames has been assigned the lead role for astrobiology by NASA in recognition of its strong history of leadership in multidisciplinary research in the space, Earth, and life sciences and its pioneering work in studies of the living universe. This initial science workshop was established to lay the foundation for what is to become a national effort in astrobiology, with anticipated participation by the university community, other NASA centers, and other agencies. This workshop (the first meeting of its kind ever held) involved life, Earth, and space scientists in a truly interdisciplinary sharing of ideas related to life in the universe, and by all accounts was a resounding success.","[{""submissionId"":19970025374,""id"":""fe628811d52c49eb88e261da3f73e91d"",""publicationDate"":""1996-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":19970025374,""name"":""NASA Ames Research Center"",""location"":""Moffett Field, CA United States"",""id"":""ba49934242474e9c8660aa0a6ab81963""}]",PUBLIC,"[""RTOP 199-90-07"",""RTOP 622-65-32"",""RTOP 154-88-00""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":19970025384,""title"":""Evolution of the Early Earth and Its Biosphere""},{""id"":19970025398,""title"":""Planetary Perspective on Life on Early Mars and the Early Earth""},{""id"":19970025381,""title"":""Gravity and Biology""},{""id"":19970025375,""title"":""Understanding the Role of Biology in the Global Environment: NASA'S Mission to Planet Earth""},{""id"":19970025379,""title"":""The Search for Life on Mars""},{""id"":19970025385,""title"":""Response of Earth's Ecosystem to Global Change""},{""id"":19970025376,""title"":""Key Questions in Astrobiology""},{""id"":19970025389,""title"":""Gravity Sensor Plasticity in the Space Environment""},{""id"":19970025394,""title"":""Destination Mars: An Astronaut's Perspective""},{""id"":19970025382,""title"":""Complex Molecules in the Interstellar Medium""},{""id"":19970025396,""title"":""Theory of Planetary System Formation""},{""id"":19970025402,""title"":""Exploring Mars for Evidence of Past or Present Life: Roles of Robotic and Human Missions""},{""id"":19970025375,""title"":""Understanding the Role of Biology in the Global Environment: NASA'S Mission to Planet Earth""},{""id"":19970025376,""title"":""Key Questions in Astrobiology""},{""id"":19970025379,""title"":""The Search for Life on Mars""},{""id"":19970025381,""title"":""Gravity and Biology""},{""id"":19970025382,""title"":""Complex Molecules in the Interstellar Medium""},{""id"":19970025384,""title"":""Evolution of the Early Earth and Its Biosphere""},{""id"":19970025385,""title"":""Response of Earth's Ecosystem to Global Change""},{""id"":19970025389,""title"":""Gravity Sensor Plasticity in the Space Environment""},{""id"":19970025394,""title"":""Destination Mars: An Astronaut's Perspective""},{""id"":19970025396,""title"":""Theory of Planetary System Formation""},{""id"":19970025398,""title"":""Planetary Perspective on Life on Early Mars and the Early Earth""},{""id"":19970025402,""title"":""Exploring Mars for Evidence of Past or Present Life: Roles of Robotic and Human Missions""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19970025374

A."",""Denissova, N.""]","Exposure to low doses of 56Fe particles produces changes in neural function and behavior. The present experiments were designed to examine the effects of irradiation on the acquisition of a dopamine-mediated conditioned place preference (CPP). In the CPP procedure, rats are given an injection of the dopamine agonist amphetamine in one distinctive compartment and a saline injection in a different compartment of a three-compartment apparatus. Control rats develop a preference for the amphetamine-paired compartment. In contrast, rats exposed to 1 Gy of 56Fe particles fail to develop a similar preference. The results of the experiment indicate that exposure to low doses of heavy particles can disrupt the neural mechanisms that mediate the reinforcement of behavior.","[{""volume"":""17 Suppl 1"",""submissionId"":20040088540,""issn"":""1120-1797"",""id"":""ae66bfda66924cd69466e80af259c59a"",""publicationName"":""Physica medica :  PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG9-1190"",""NAG5-6093""]",undefined,"[""Behavioral Sciences""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088540

Ions from protons to lanthanum at energies up to 670 MeV/a have been used to irradiate mice, and prevalence of Harderian gland tumors has been measured 16 months after irradiation. The Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) for tumor induction has been expressed as the RBE(sub max), which is the ratio of the initial slopes of the dose vs prevalence curve. The RBE(sub max) has been found to be approximately 30 for ions with Linear Energy Transfer (LET) values in excess of 100 keV/micrometer. Analysis on the basis of fluence as a substitute for dose has shown that on a per particle basis all of the ions with LET values in excess of 100 keV/micrometer have equal effectiveness. An analysis of the probabilities of ion traversals of the nucleus has shown that for these high stopping powers that a single hit is effective in producing neoplastic transformation.","[{""volume"":""14"",""submissionId"":19940039084,""issue"":""10"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""80da2f2b507941ac9db166a5132aee43"",""publicationName"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1"",""publicationDate"":""1994-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""T1931M"",""DE-AC05-85OR21400"",""DE-AC03-76SF00098""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""},{""id"":19940039019,""title"":""Life Sciences and Space Research 25 (2) Radiation Biology: Topical Meeting of the COSPAR Interdisciplinary Scientific Commission F of the COSPAR 29th Plenary Meeting, Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sep. 5, 1992""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940039084

Topics include research on biological and chemical evolution including prebiotic evolution: cosmic and terrestrial; mechanisms of abiogenesis including synthesis and reactions of biomonomers; and analysis of cometary matter and its possible relationship to organic compounds on Earth. Theories and research on origins of ribonucleic acids (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and other amino acids and complex proteins including their autocatalysis, replication, and translation are presented. Abiotic synthesis of biopolymers, mechanisms of the Genetic Code, precellular membrane systems and energetics are considered. Earth planetary evolution including early microfossils and geochemical conditions and simulations to study these conditions are discussed. The role of chirality in precellular evolution and the taxonomy and phylogeny of very simple organisms are reported. Past and future explorations in exobiology and space research directed toward study of the origins of life and solar system evolution are described.","[{""volume"":""24"",""submissionId"":19950032145,""issue"":""2-4"",""issn"":""0169-6149"",""eissn"":""1573-0875"",""id"":""9bb399e715314ed488f4c389e7e4340f"",""publicationName"":""Origins
