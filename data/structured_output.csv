Protective effects of Fraxinus Micrantha against thioacetamide-induced hepatic encephalopathy: a focus on antioxidant and neuroprotective mechanisms.,"Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a multifaceted neuropsychiatric syndrome frequently observed in patients with liver dysfunction. The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Fraxinus micrantha (F. micrantha) in thioacetamide (TAA)-induced HE model. HE was induced using TAA (200 mg/kg i.p.) for once every 48 h for 14 consecutive days in rats. Ethyl acetate fraction of F. micrantha (EAFM) (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) was administered for 14 consecutive days (p.o.) after HE induction. TAA induced hepatotoxicity and HE, evidenced by significant alterations in liver biomarkers alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lipid profiles (triglycerides, cholesterol), and neurotransmitter levels (serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine). Histopathological analysis revealed severe liver necrosis, inflammation, and brain damage, characterized by reduced neuronal density and hippocampal degeneration. EAFM treatment produced a significant, dose-dependent amelioration of TAA-induced liver injury, evidenced by the normalization of serum biomarkers (ALT, AST, ALP) and lipid profiles (cholesterol, triglycerides), with the 200 mg/kg dose showing efficacy comparable to silymarin. EAFM also exerted potent neuroprotective effects, restoring the altered levels of key neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine) and reducing elevated acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, EAFM significantly mitigated oxidative stress by replenishing depleted reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in both hepatic and brain tissues. Histopathological analysis confirmed these findings, demonstrating that EAFM attenuated TAA-induced hepatocellular necrosis, inflammation, and hippocampal neurodegeneration. The results indicate that F. micrantha confers robust hepatoprotective and neuroprotective effects against HE, primarily mediated through its antioxidant activity and restoration of neurochemical balance, positioning it as a promising therapeutic candidate.","Ritupal, Singh, Singh, Singh",PubMed, Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a multifaceted neuropsychiatric syndrome frequently observed in patients with liver dysfunction .

Effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on years of life lost in radical cystectomy-treated T2N0M0 bladder cancer patients.,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy (RC) is standard of care for T2N0M0 urothelial carcinoma of urinary bladder (UCUB) patients. However, the effect of NAC on years of life lost (YLL) in RC-treated T2N0M0 patients has never been quantified.","Longoni, Falkenbach, Marmiroli, Le, Nicolazzini, Catanzaro, Polverino, Goyal, Graefen, Ferro, Chun, Volpe, Schiavina, Longo, Saad, Shariat, Quarta, Moschini, Gandaglia, Montorsi, Briganti, Karakiewicz",PubMed, Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy (RC) is standard of care for T2N0M0Urothelial carcinoma of urinary bladder (UCUB) patients .

Vestibulo-sympathetic interaction and otolith function in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.,"The association between blood pressure variability (BPV) or heart rate variability (HRV) and the baroreflex is well established. However, the role of the vestibular-autonomic reflex in regulating BP and HR stability has primarily been explored only in experimental studies. We aimed to delineate the association of BPV and HRV with otolith function in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).","Woo, Kim, Kim, Park, Lee, Park, Kim, Kim, Kim",PubMed, The association between blood pressure variability (BPV) or heart rate variability (HRV) and the baroreflex is well established .

Electrophoresis-based electrochemical sensor for rapid detection of sialic acid in human serum.,"A novel electrochemical sensor is introduced that significantly accelerates sialic acid (SA) detection by utilizing an electrophoresis device, which reduces the binding time from 20 to 5 min. The results indicate that the current signal change (ΔI) of the sensor is more than twofold higher than that of conventional sensors after 5 min. Furthermore, to enhance the intensity of the sensor's signal and simplify the operational procedure, we employed a method that electrochemically reduces graphene oxide/3-aminophenylboronic acid (GO/APBA) to reduced graphene oxide/3-aminophenylboronic acid (rGO/APBA) in a single step. This reduction process effectively removes some oxygen groups from GO, further enhancing the current signal. The linear detection range for SA was between 0.1 mM and 3 mM, with a detection limit of 0.084 mM (S/N = 3). Notably, the electrophoresis-enhanced sensor can successfully detect SA in actual human serum samples. Overall, this sensor represents a significant advancement in the electrochemical sensing of SA, providing a rapid, selective, and cost-effective approach for developing electric field-enhanced detection technologies.","Ming, Wu, Yin, Zuo, Lu, Wu, Li, Tang, Liu, Hou, Hu, Zang",PubMed, A novel electrochemical sensor significantly accelerates sialic acid (SA) detection by utilizing an electrophoresis device .

Selective facilitation of short latency postural reflexes by instability.,"We sought to determine if enhancement of postural reflexes occurs specifically in response to instability induced by leaning and the possible neural level at which this may be mediated. Healthy participants (n = 10; 37 ± 15 years) were asked to adopt leaning postures to increase postural instability. Recordings of postural, eye and neck muscles and from over the cerebellum were made during stable upright stance and with the feet plantarflexed or dorsiflexed. The latter postures were used to modulate tonic activity levels in the soleus and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles to a similar degree to leaning. External perturbations were delivered to the trunk [vertebra prominens (C7) and upper sternum] and at the mastoids. C7 stimulation produced larger short latency (SL) reflex amplitudes in soleus during forwards lean than upright stance, when using matched tonic levels, although SL amplitudes in TA in response to sternal stimulation were unaffected when tonic activity was matched. Cerebellar evoked responses were larger during anterior than posterior lean for truncal stimuli. Mastoid stimulation generally evoked larger responses in the legs during lean than during upright stance with matching tonic EMG levels. Vestibular and non-vestibular responses recorded from the sternocleidomastoid muscles were often larger during posterior lean, independent of the direction of mastoid stimulation. Short-latency vestibular evoked cerebellar responses and extraocular responses were unaffected by posture. Facilitation of postural reflexes by instability occurred for axially-evoked postural reflexes in soleus but not TA. We propose that this effect is mediated by modulation of descending brainstem projections.","Govender, Hochstrasser, Todd, Colebatch",PubMed," Healthy participants were asked to adopt leaning postures to increase postural instability .

Curcumin: multifaceted biological actions and therapeutic implications-a narrative review.,"Curcumin, a bioactive polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has garnered considerable attention for its wide-ranging pharmacological properties and potential therapeutic applications. This narrative review critically synthesizes current evidence on curcumin's multifaceted biological actions, encompassing its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and metabolic regulatory effects. Extensive preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that curcumin exerts beneficial effects by modulating key cellular signaling pathways and mitigating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Despite its promising profile, clinical translation has been hampered by issues related to low bioavailability and rapid metabolism. Recent advances in novel formulation strategies and combination therapies, however, have shown potential in overcoming these limitations. This review uniquely consolidates recent mechanistic insights with clinical translation challenges, identifying specific gaps in bioavailability research and proposing novel combination therapy approaches that distinguish it from existing curcumin reviews, ultimately facilitating evidence-based therapeutic development.","Ghorbani-Nejad, Baghani, Amiri, Delche, Darijani, Soltani, Nezami, Rahimzadegan",PubMed," Curcumin, a bioactive polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has garnered considerable attention for its wide-ranging pharmacological properties and potential therapeutic applications .

Anesthesia and mitochondria: balancing toxicity and protection through emerging therapeutic strategies.,"Anesthesia is a cornerstone of modern surgical practice, enabling interventions by deliberately modulating nociception and consciousness-from localized analgesia and mild sedation to deep unconsciousness. Yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms that produce these reversible states remain only partly defined, constraining our ability to predict interpatient variability, prevent mitochondrial- and neurotoxicity-related adverse effects, and optimize agent selection, dosing, and timing across perioperative care. Beyond their intended effects, anesthetics and their adjuvants impose substantial physiological stress on the brain, metabolism, and immune system, with particularly pronounced risks in vulnerable populations such as pediatric and elderly patients with developing and otherwise fragile neural networks. Recent studies have highlighted mitochondria, the cell's energy processing unit and key regulator of homeostasis, as especially susceptible to anesthetic exposure. Evidence indicates that agents used in the perioperative period may disrupt mitochondrial function by altering oxidative phosphorylation, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and impairing mitochondrial dynamics. Such disruptions can contribute to neurotoxicity, metabolic dysregulation, and immune suppression, potentially affecting postoperative recovery and long-term cognitive outcomes. This review critically examines emerging data on the interplay between anesthesia agents and mitochondrial function. We discuss the implications of mitochondrial dysfunction for neural health and postoperative recovery, and we highlight current and prospective strategies to possibly refine anesthesia drug protocols through targeted mitochondrial therapeutics. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of these mitochondrial interactions is imperative for developing safer, more effective anesthesia practices, especially for pediatric and other high-risk patient populations.","Zambrano, Castillo, Maldonado, Fritzhand, Miranda, Mujica, Viera-Catota, Castañeda, Vasconez, Caicedo, Gavilanes",PubMed," Anesthesia is a cornerstone of modern surgical practice, enabling interventions by deliberately modulating nociception and consciousness .

Impact of pet ownership in early childhood at ages 1 and 4-5 years on mental health at ages 7-8: findings from the INMA project.,We aimed to explore associations between the presence of pets at one and 4-5 years of age with internalizing and externalizing problems at 7-8 years.,"González, Guxens, Sarzo, Andiarena, Santa-Marina, Tardón, Julvez, Rodríguez-Dehli, Rebagliato, Estarlich",PubMed, We aimed to explore associations between the presence of pets at one and 4-5 years of age with internalizing and externalizing problems at 7-8 years .
Harnessing Next-Generation 3D Cancer Models to Elucidate Tumor-Microbiome Crosstalk.,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic ecosystem increasingly recognized for its interplay with the microbiome. In colorectal, breast, lung, liver, and brain cancers, bacterial communities and their metabolites are shown to influence tumor progression, immune responses, and therapeutic outcomes. To study these interactions in physiologically relevant contexts, advanced 3D in vitro models have emerged, including spheroids, organoids, microfluidic organ-on-a-chip platforms, and 3D-bioprinted constructs. These systems provide spatial organization, mechanical cues, and co-culture capabilities that facilitate investigation of host-microbiome-tumor cross-talk. Incorporation of live bacteria, their metabolites, and immune components into these platforms has yielded new insights into how the microbiome shapes cancer behavior, inflammation, and drug resistance. This review outlines recent advances in 3D model development for studying tumor-microbiome interactions, highlighting organ-specific applications, extracellular matrix-mimicking hydrogels, and biofabrication strategies. It also addresses key challenges, including maintaining microbiome viability, modeling temporal dynamics, and integrating immune complexity. Overcoming these limitations requires interdisciplinary approaches that merge bioengineering, microbiology, and oncology. Evolving 3D platforms offer powerful tools for microbiome-informed cancer modeling and hold significant promise for advancing therapeutic screening and precision oncology.","Green Buzhor, Longobardi, Kandli, Krinsky, Avramoff, Katyal, Salomon, Miari, Venkert, Barnatan, García Alvarado, Greenberg, Satchi-Fainaro",PubMed," The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic ecosystem increasingly recognized for its interplay with the microbiome .

Simplified and Accurate Approach to Sleep Disorder Prediction Using Body Composition Metrics: A Development and Validation Study.,"Predicting the risk of sleep disorders such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA) typically requires costly and time-consuming assessments. The SLEEPS algorithm simplifies this process using only nine questions, including body mass index (BMI). However, BMI alone cannot capture differences in body composition, as individuals with the same BMI may have different muscle and fat distribution. This study aims to improve sleep disorder prediction by incorporating body composition metrics. To achieve this, we applied a tree-based machine learning algorithm to a dataset of 3,291 patients, evaluating demographic data, sleep-related questions, and body composition metrics as potential features for the model. The final feature selection was performed using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method. The resulting model, I-SLEEPS (InBody-based SimpLE quEstionnairE Predicting Sleep disorders), used a total of 10 features, including skeletal muscle index (SMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI) instead of BMI, along with the original SLEEPS questionnaire items. I-SLEEPS achieved superior predictive accuracy (AUROC > 0.93 for insomnia, OSA, and COMISA) compared to SLEEPS (AUROC > 0.90). Additionally, our approach significantly enhanced area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) values, which is critical for addressing the imbalanced datasets of insomnia and COMISA. Furthermore, our analysis revealed distinct relationships between muscle mass indices (SMI and FFMI) and the risks of insomnia, OSA, and COMISA, providing new insights into the role of body composition in sleep disorders. By leveraging InBody analysis, I-SLEEPS offers a practical, non-invasive alternative to traditional screening methods such as polysomnography.","Cawiding, Bae, Kim, Joo, Kim",PubMed," Study aims to improve sleep disorder prediction by incorporating body composition metrics .

Periodic and Aperiodic Alterations of Resting-State EEG in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders: Cognitive and Clinical Insights.,"Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are marked by cognitive deficits and clinical symptoms linked to disrupted neural oscillations. While changes in spectral power are well documented in SSD, many studies have not clearly separated rhythmic (periodic) from the nonrhythmic (aperiodic) brain activity. This study examined both periodic and aperiodic resting-state EEG components in SSD, recorded from 152 healthy controls and 97 SSD participants. EEG features (periodic power, bandwidth, center frequency; aperiodic exponent and offset) were extracted from global scalp averages and frontoinsular regions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), right anterior insula (R-INS), and left anterior insula (L-INS). At the scalp level, SSD individuals exhibited a global increase in theta power, along with a decreased alpha center frequency. Aperiodic activity showed increased exponent and offset in SSD. In frontoinsular regions, increased theta power was observed in the dACC, R-INS, and L-INS, along with lower alpha center frequency in L-INS. No significant differences were found for aperiodic activity in these regions. Increased frontoinsular theta power, especially in the dACC, was associated with worse cognitive performance, particularly global cognition and working memory. These findings highlight the importance of separating periodic and aperiodic EEG activity in SSD, suggesting that periodic alterations, particularly in frontoinsular theta oscillations, may underlie cognitive dysfunction in SSD.","Hasanaj, Jaeger, Karsli, Schulz, Boudriot, Roell, Korman, Kallweit, Dengl, Klimas, Fischer, Hanken, Meisinger, Moussiopoulou, Yakimov, Karch, Hasan, Schmitt, Falkai, Pogarell, Raabe, Wagner, Mortazavi, Keeser",PubMed," Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are marked by cognitive deficits and clinical symptoms linked to disrupted neural oscillations .

A Whole-Brain Connectome-Wide Signature of Transdiagnostic Depression Severity Across Major Depressive Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.,"Depressive symptoms are commonly observed in stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To date, emerging evidence from behavior and psychology suggests the possibility of underlying neurobiological mechanisms in transdiagnostic depression. This study aims to identify predictive signatures of depression severity across MDD and PTSD using a whole-brain connectivity machine learning analysis based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Patients with MDD (n = 84) and PTSD (n = 65), all medication-free at the time of enrollment, underwent rs-fMRI scans along with a battery of clinical assessments. Using a multivariate machine learning approach, we applied sparse connectome predictive modeling to identify a functional connectivity signature that predicts individual depression severity, as assessed by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 items. The cross-validated model explained 42% of the variance in depression severity across MDD and PTSD. The identified connectome signature predominantly involved regions in the fronto-limbic circuit (e.g., middle frontal gyrus and temporal pole), subcortical areas (e.g., hippocampal, caudate, and brainstem), and the cerebellum. Our findings highlight diffuse whole-brain dysfunction patterns associated with depressive symptom severity, emphasizing the importance of transdiagnostic research in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying key clinical features across disorders.","Yang, Yuan, Zhang, Xie, Qiu, Balgansuren, Huang, Lui, Gong, Zhang, Zhu",PubMed," Depressive symptoms are commonly observed in stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) To date, emerging evidence suggests the possibility of underlying neurobiological mechanisms in transdiagnostic depression .

Modeling cerebral palsy in animals.,"Advancements in the treatment of cerebral palsy depend on animal research. Yet, most animal models have not been fully evaluated for spasticity and dystonia using clinically relevant measures of altered tone or movement patterns, which form the basis for diagnosing people with the condition. Sensory differences and pain are almost never studied in animal models. Complicating factors include the diversity of animals and injuries used to model the condition, the diversity of outcomes after acquired injury, and translating clinical measures into reliable and repeatable measurements tailored to animals, ideally using common data elements. We summarize preclinical models based on acquired injury to the nervous system in cerebral palsy research over the years and provide a comparison of developmental time courses for common laboratory animals. We encourage researchers to coalesce on consistent, reliable measurements for assessing both sensory and motor systems to ensure that animal models reflect meaningful aspects of the condition.","Quinlan, Reedich, Mena Avila, Moline, Genry, Detloff, Katholi, Gaebler-Spira, Aravamuthan",PubMed, Most animal models have not been fully evaluated for spasticity and dystonia using clinically relevant measures of altered tone or movement patterns .

Can atogepant be a preventive treatment for cluster headache?-Insights from a case series.,"Cluster headache (CH) is a disabling primary headache disorder with limited therapeutic options. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is known to be involved in CH pathophysiology; however, except for galcanezumab (300 mg) in episodic CH, anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies did not reduce CH attacks in randomized clinical trials. Atogepant is an oral, small-molecule, CGRP receptor antagonist, which is approved for the preventive treatment of migraine. Here, we describe four case reports of CH (two episodic CH and two chronic CH), unresponsive to previous prophylactic treatments, who responded to daily atogepant (60 mg). Chronic CH cases were refractory to subcutaneous galcanezumab. In one case, a reduction to atogepant (30 mg daily) resulted in recurrence of headache attacks, which subsided on reintroduction of the initial dose. No serious adverse effects were reported. Despite the limited number of cases and the open retrospective design, our case series suggests atogepant as a possible prophylactic treatment for CH. Further research on CGRP signaling in CH and the implementation of well-designed clinical trials are necessary.","Serrão, Sotero, Kaupilla, Martins",PubMed," Cluster headache (CH) is a disabling primary headache disorder with limited therapeutic options .

The mGluR5 agonist CHPG enhances human oligodendrocyte differentiation.,"Previous studies in adult mice indicate that the mGluR5 agonist 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenyl glycine (CHPG), reduces cuprizone-elicited losses in myelin. This effect is partly mediated by CHPG binding to mGluR5 receptors on reactive astrocytes, triggering the release of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which results in an increase in myelin. However, it remains unclear whether CHPG has similar beneficial effects on human oligodendrocytes.
