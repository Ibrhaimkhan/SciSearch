20040141459,REPRINT,Physiology of a microgravity environment invited review: microgravity and skeletal muscle,"[""Fitts, R. H."",""Riley, D. R."",""Widrick, J. J.""]","Spaceflight (SF) has been shown to cause skeletal muscle atrophy; a loss in force and power; and, in the first few weeks, a preferential atrophy of extensors over flexors. The atrophy primarily results from a reduced protein synthesis that is likely triggered by the removal of the antigravity load. Contractile proteins are lost out of proportion to other cellular proteins, and the actin thin filament is lost disproportionately to the myosin thick filament. The decline in contractile protein explains the decrease in force per cross-sectional area, whereas the thin-filament loss may explain the observed postflight increase in the maximal velocity of shortening in the type I and IIa fiber types. Importantly, the microgravity-induced decline in peak power is partially offset by the increased fiber velocity. Muscle velocity is further increased by the microgravity-induced expression of fast-type myosin isozymes in slow fibers (hybrid I/II fibers) and by the increased expression of fast type II fiber types. SF increases the susceptibility of skeletal muscle to damage, with the actual damage elicited during postflight reloading. Evidence in rats indicates that SF increases fatigability and reduces the capacity for fat oxidation in skeletal muscles. Future studies will be required to establish the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the SF-induced muscle atrophy and functional loss and to develop effective exercise countermeasures.","[{""volume"":""89"",""submissionId"":20040141459,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""8750-7587"",""id"":""5d38fcd1b22548209e25c2363881b32c"",""publicationName"":""Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. :  1985)"",""publicationDate"":""2000-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040141459

Using electromyography (EMG) to monitor 'postural' muscles, it was found that free floating arm flexions made in microgravity were not always preceded by neuromuscular activation patterns normally observed during movements made in unit gravity. Additionally, manipulation of foot sensory input during microgravity arm flexion impacted upon anticipatory postural muscle activation.","[{""volume"":""14"",""submissionId"":19950029079,""issue"":""8"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""isbn"":""0-08-042485-6"",""id"":""8dbfbc63c8834297b6047b6ee69de21b"",""publicationName"":""Life sciences and space research 25 (1).

NASA researchers have developed a number of exercise devices to address this problem. The most recent is the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), which is currently used by astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) to emulate typical free-weight exercises in microgravity. ARED exercise on the ISS is intended to reproduce Earth-level muscle loads, but the actual muscle loads produced remain unknown as they cannot currently be measured directly. In this study we estimated muscle loads experienced during squat exercise on ARED in microgravity conditions representative of Mars, the moon, and the ISS. The estimates were generated using a subject-specific musculoskeletal computer model and ARED exercise data collected on Earth. The results provide insight into the capabilities and limitations of the ARED machine.","[{""submissionId"":20130000723,""id"":""cd001d78caa9460bb12519567428021f"",""publicationDate"":""2012-06-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Puerto Rico"",""submissionId"":20130000723,""endDate"":""2012-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""ASME 2012 Summer Bioengineering Conference (SBC2012)"",""location"":""Farjardo"",""id"":""a8d0ab6575734c51a5c97c4998b45f7c"",""startDate"":""2012-06-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20130000723

Although this area could cover a wide range of investigative efforts, the limited funding resulted in the selection of two projects. These projects would result in data contributing to an area of research deemed high priority by NASA and would address issues of the alterations in renal response to vasoactive stimuli during conditions of skeletal muscle disuse as well as investigate the contribution of skeletal muscle disuse, conditions normally found in long term human exposure to microgravity, to the balance of fluid and macromolecules within the vasculature versus the interstitium. These two projects selected are as follows: investigate the role of angiotensin 2 on renal function during periods of simulated microgravity and skeletal muscle disuse to determine if the renal response is altered to changes in circulating concentrations of angiotensin 2 compared to appropriate controls; and determine if the shift of fluid balance from vasculature to the interstitium, the two components of extracellular fluid volume, that occur during prolonged exposure to microgravity and skeletal muscle disuse is a result, in part, to alterations in the fluid and macromolecular balance in the peripheral capillary beds, of which the skeletal muscle contains the majority of recruitment capillaries. A recruitment capillary bed would be most sensitive to alterations in Starling forces and fluid and macromolecular permeability.","[{""submissionId"":19940009351,""id"":""9f06c878b9de42ba93c1a5a1dd920d97"",""publicationDate"":""1992-10-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NCC2-556""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940009351
19900017137,OTHER,Effects of microgravity on rat muscle,"[""Riley, D. A.""]","It is well known that humans exposed to long term spaceflight experience undesirable progressive muscle weakness and increased fatigability. This problem has prompted the implementation of inflight exercise programs because most investigators believe that the major cause of diminished muscle performance is a combination of disuse and decreased workload. Inflight exercise has improved muscle health, but deficits have persisted, indicating that either the regimens utilized were suboptimal or there existed additional debilitating factors which were not remedied by exercise. Clarification of this question requires an improved understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of spaceflight-induced muscle deterioration. To this end, multiple investigations have been performed on the muscles from rats orbited 5 to 22 days in Cosmos biosatellites and Spacelab-3 (2,4,5,8,10 to 14,16,18,19,21 to 23,25,27,28). The eight Cosmos 1887 investigations examined the structural and biochemical changes in skeletal and cardiac muscles of rats exposed to microgravity for 12.5 days and returned to terrestrial gravity 2.3 days before tissues were collected. Even though interpretation of these results was complicated by the combination of inflight and postflight induced alterations, the consensus is that there is marked heterogeneity in both degree and type of responses from the whole muscle level down to the molecular level. Collectively, the muscle investigations of Cosmos 1887 clearly illustrate the wide diversity of muscle tissue responses to spaceflight. Judging from the summary report of this mission, heterogeneity of responses is not unique to muscle tissue. Elucidating the mechanism underlying this heterogeneity holds the key to explaining adaptation of the organism to prolonged spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":19900017137,""id"":""c52f03084ffe4e2da3b39a19ea5e3209"",""publicationName"":""NASA, Ames Research Center, The US Experiments Flown on the Soviet Biosatellite Cosmos 1887"",""publicationDate"":""1990-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19900017137

20040088747,REPRINT,Functional and structural adaptations of skeletal muscle to microgravity,"[""Fitts, R. H."",""Riley, D. R."",""Widrick, J. J.""]","Our purpose is to summarize the major effects of space travel on skeletal muscle with particular emphasis on factors that alter function. The primary deleterious changes are muscle atrophy and the associated decline in peak force and power. Studies on both rats and humans demonstrate a rapid loss of cell mass with microgravity. In rats, a reduction in muscle mass of up to 37% was observed within 1 week. For both species, the antigravity soleus muscle showed greater atrophy than the fast-twitch gastrocnemius. However, in the rat, the slow type I fibers atrophied more than the fast type II fibers, while in humans, the fast type II fibers were at least as susceptible to space-induced atrophy as the slow fiber type. Space flight also resulted in a significant decline in peak force. For example, the maximal voluntary contraction of the human plantar flexor muscles declined by 20-48% following 6 months in space, while a 21% decline in the peak force of the soleus type I fibers was observed after a 17-day shuttle flight. The reduced force can be attributed both to muscle atrophy and to a selective loss of contractile protein. The former was the primary cause because, when force was expressed per cross-sectional area (kNm(-2)), the human fast type II and slow type I fibers of the soleus showed no change and a 4% decrease in force, respectively. Microgravity has been shown to increase the shortening velocity of the plantar flexors. This increase can be attributed both to an elevated maximal shortening velocity (V(0)) of the individual slow and fast fibers and to an increased expression of fibers containing fast myosin. Although the cause of the former is unknown, it might result from the selective loss of the thin filament actin and an associated decline in the internal drag during cross-bridge cycling. Despite the increase in fiber V(0), peak power of the slow type I fiber was reduced following space flight. The decreased power was a direct result of the reduced force caused by the fiber atrophy. In addition to fiber atrophy and the loss of force and power, weightlessness reduces the ability of the slow soleus to oxidize fats and increases the utilization of muscle glycogen, at least in rats. This substrate change leads to an increased rate of fatigue. Finally, with return to the 1g environment of earth, rat studies have shown an increased occurrence of eccentric contraction-induced fiber damage. The damage occurs with re-loading and not in-flight, but the etiology has not been established.","[{""volume"":""204"",""submissionId"":20040088747,""issue"":""Pt 18"",""issn"":""0022-0949"",""id"":""73689f2bb84f40a0a51d499987a769b1"",""publicationName"":""The Journal of experimental biology"",""publicationDate"":""2001-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088747
19950055916,REPRINT,Crustaceans as a model for microgravity-induced muscle atrophy,"[""Mykles, D. L.""]","Atrophy of skeletal muscles is a serious problem in a microgravity environment. It is hypothesized that the unloading of postural muscles, which no longer must resist gravity force, causes an accelerated breakdown of contractile proteins, resulting in reduction in muscle mass and strength. A crustacean model using the land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis, to assess the effects of spaceflight on protein meatabolism is presented. The model is compared to a developmentally-regulated atrophy in which a premolt reduction in muscle mass allows the withdrawal of the large claws at molt. The biochemical mechanisms underlying protein breakdown involves both Ca2(+) -dependent and multicatalytic proteolytic enzymes. Crustacean claw muscle can be used to determine the interactions between shortening and unloading at the molecular level.","[{""volume"":""17"",""submissionId"":19950055916,""issue"":""6-7"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""id"":""42a1a325b3cc447e8152f6eb088764a1"",""publicationName"":""Advances in Space Research"",""publicationDate"":""1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{},{}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19950055916
20180000833,ABSTRACT,Systemic Microgravity Response: Utilizing GeneLab to Develop Hypotheses for Spaceflight Risks,"[""Beheshti, Afshin"",""Fogle, Homer"",""Galazka, Jonathan "",""Kidane, Yared "",""Chakravarty, Kaushik"",""Berrios, Daniel C."",""Costes, Sylvain V.""]","Biological risks associated with microgravity is a major concern for space travel. Although determination of risk has been a focus for NASA research, data examining systemic (i.e., multi- or pan-tissue) responses to space flight are sparse. The overall goal of our work is to identify potential master regulators responsible for such responses to microgravity conditions. To do this we utilized the NASA GeneLab database which contains a wide array of omics experiments, including data from: 1) different flight conditions (space shuttle (STS) missions vs. International Space Station (ISS); 2) different tissues; and 3) different types of assays that measure epigenetic, transcriptional, and protein expression changes. We have performed meta-analysis identifying potential master regulators involved with systemic responses to microgravity. The analysis used 7 different murine and rat data sets, examining the following tissues: liver, kidney, adrenal gland, thymus, mammary gland, skin, and skeletal muscle (soleus, extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius). Using a systems biology approach, we were able to determine that p53 and immune related pathways appear central to pan-tissue microgravity responses. Evidence for a universal response in the form of consistency of change across tissues in regulatory pathways was observed in both STS and ISS experiments with varying durations; while degree of change in expression of these master regulators varied across species and strain, some change in these master regulators was universally observed. Interestingly, certain skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius and soleus) show an overall down-regulation in these genes, while in other types (extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior and quadriceps) they are up-regulated, suggesting certain muscle tissues may be compensating for atrophy responses caused by microgravity. Studying these organtissue-specific perturbations in molecular signaling networks, we demonstrate the value of GeneLab in characterizing potential master regulators associated with biological risks for spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":20180000833,""id"":""e0bbfce73d51446db12f0e694e91ee8f"",""publicationDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20180000833,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States"",""id"":""2d0ce10d532b40c4b7b01158f4444c3e""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180000833,""endDate"":""2017-10-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""10c791cc4717459da4dff0bd65db3147"",""id"":""e97b995336d04c3298b112a8ae45d6d5""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Seattle, WA"",""id"":""10c791cc4717459da4dff0bd65db3147"",""startDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C"",""NNA14AB82C"",""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20170011266,""title"":""Systemic Microgravity Response: Utilizing GeneLab to Develop Hypotheses for Spaceflight Risks""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180000833
20190001974,BOOK,Exposure to Microgravity for 30 Days Onboard Bion M1 Caused Muscle Atrophy and Decreased Regeneration in the Mouse Femoral Quadriceps,"[""Grigoryan, E. N."",""Blaber, E."",""Poplinskaya, V. A."",""Markitantova, Y. V."",""Radugina, E. A."",""Almeida, E. A. C.""]","Mechanical unloading of muscle during spaceflight in microgravity is known to cause muscular atrophy, changes in muscle fiber type composition, gene expression, and reductions in regenerative muscle growth. Although limited data exists for long-term effects of microgravity in human muscle, these processes have mostly been studied in rodents for short periods of time. Here we report on how 30-day, long-term, mechanical unloading in microgravity affects mouse muscle of the femoral Quadriceps group. To conduct these studies we used muscle tissue from 6 mice from the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program conducted in collaboration with the Institute for Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, during the Russian Bion M1 biosatellite mission in 2013. Muscle morphology observed in histological sections shows signs of extensive atrophy and regenerative hypoplasia. Specifically, we observed a two-fold decrease in the number of myonuclei, their central location, low density of myofibers and myofibrils, in fragmentation and swelling of myofibers. Despite obvious atrophy, muscle regeneration nevertheless appears to have continued after 30 days in microgravity as evidenced by thin and short newly formed myofibers. Many of them however showed evidence of apoptotic, TUNEL positive cells and myofibrils degradation, suggesting long-term unloading in microgravity affects late stages of myofiber differentiation. Ground asynchronous and vivarium control animals showed normal, well-developed tissue structure with sufficient blood and nerve supply and evidence of regenerative formation of new myofibers free of apoptotic nuclei. Myonuclei stress response in spaceflight animals was detected by positive nuclear immunolocalization of c-jun and c-myc proteins. Regenerative activity of satellite cells in muscles is detected in mice of all animal groups, by pax7, MyoD, and myogenin immunostaining and myogenin PCR analysis. In summary, long-term spaceflight in microgravity causes significant atrophy and degeneration of the femoral Quadriceps muscle group, and it may interfere with muscle regenerative processes by inducing apoptosis in newly-formed myofibrils during their differentiation phase.","[{""volume"":""16"",""submissionId"":20190001974,""issn"":""2214-5524"",""publisher"":""Elsevier"",""eissn"":""2214-5532"",""id"":""cb80775c69934f7eb64138a2a21889b1"",""publicationName"":""Life Sciences in Space Research"",""publicationDate"":""2014-11-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNH06CC03B""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190001974
20000029480,OTHER,Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Muscle Fiber Composition Under Microgravity,"[""Rosenthal, Nadia A.""]","The overall goal of this project is to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the selective and debilitating atrophy of specific skeletal muscle fiber types that accompanies sustained conditions of microgravity. Since little is currently known about the regulation of fiber-specific gene expression programs in mammalian muscle, elucidation of the basic mechanisms of fiber diversification is a necessary prerequisite to the generation of therapeutic strategies for attenuation of muscle atrophy on earth or in space. Vertebrate skeletal muscle development involves the fusion of undifferentiated mononucleated myoblasts to form multinucleated myofibers, with a concomitant activation of muscle-specific genes encoding proteins that form the force-generating contractile apparatus. The regulatory circuitry controlling skeletal muscle gene expression has been well studied in a number of vertebrate animal systems. The goal of this project has been to achieve a similar level of understanding of the mechanisms underlying the further specification of muscles into different fiber types, and the role played by innervation and physical activity in the maintenance and adaptation of different fiber phenotypes into adulthood. Our recent research on the genetic basis of fiber specificity has focused on the emergence of mature fiber types and have implicated a group of transcriptional regulatory proteins, known as E proteins, in the control of fiber specificity. The restriction of E proteins to selected muscle fiber types is an attractive hypothetical mechanism for the generation of muscle fiber-specific patterns of gene expression. To date our results support a model wherein different E proteins are selectively expressed in muscle cells to determine fiber-restricted gene expression. These studies are a first step to define the molecular mechanisms responsible for the shifts in fiber type under conditions of microgravity, and to determine the potential importance of E proteins as upstream targets for the effects of weightlessness. In the past year we have determined that the expression of E Proteins is restricted to specific fiber types by post-transcriptional mechanisms. By far, the most prevalent mechanism of cellular control for achieving post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is selective proteolysis -through the ubiquitin -proteasome pathway. Steady-state levels of HEB message are similar in all fast and slow skeletal muscle fiber types, yet the protein is restricted to Type IIX fibers. HEB appears to be a nodal point for regulating fiber-specific transcription, as expression of the transcription factor is regulated at the post-transcriptional level. It is not clear at present whether the regulation is at the level of protein synthesis or degradation. We are now poised to evaluate the biological role of ubiquitination in fiber specific-gene expression by controlling the post-transcriptional expression of E Proteins. The use of metabolic labelling and pharmacological inhibitors of the ubiquitin pathway will be used to identify the mode of regulation of the Type IIX expression pattern. The potential role of specific kinases in effecting the restriction of HEB expression will be examined by using both inhibitors and activators. The results of these studies will provide the necessary information to evaluate the biological role of E proteins in controlling fiber type transitions, and in potentially attenuating the atrophic effects of microgravity conditions. We have also recently shown that ectopic expression of the HEB protein transactivates the Type IIX-specific skeletal a-actin reporter. The 218 bp skeletal a-actin promoter drives transgene expression solely in mature Type IIX fibers. A mouse also carrying the transgene MLCI/HEB (which ectopically expresses the E Protein HEB in Type IIB fibers) forces expression of the skeletal a-actin reporter gene in Type IIB fibers. We can now dissect the composition of this fiber-specific cis-element. The skeletal a-actin promoter is quite compact and has been extensively characterized in vitro for activity and binding factors. The single E box may act as a binding target of myogenic factor/HEB heterodimer to allow for IIX expression. The HEB transcription factor may recognize either the precise flanking sequences of the E Box, or perhaps interacting with other proteins bound nearby, and activating expression in Type IIX fibers. This E box will be both ablated, and alternatively, as ablation may well destroy any muscle-specific transcriptional activity, flanking sequences substituted with those surrounding the E box (El) of the myogenin promoter. Modification of fiber-specific transgene expression will be tested in transgenic mice. The results of these studies will provide basic information on the regulatory circuitry underlying fiber specificity, and will form the basis for building appropriate transgenic regulatory cassettes to effect fiber transitions in subsequent experimental manipulations on unweighted muscles.","[{""submissionId"":20000029480,""id"":""7a378d61d69c4acb9690b5df296520c4"",""publicationName"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute"",""publicationDate"":""1999-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""},{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000029480
20180005355,OTHER,Design and Development of Modules to Support Live Microscopic Imaging on Ground-Based Microgravity Simulators,"[""Lee, Audrey""]","In space, astronauts are exposed to environmental stressors that often result in physiological changes. One prominent stressor in spaceflight is microgravity, and research has shown that long term microgravity exposure causes muscle atrophy, bone loss, cardiovascular concerns, and vision impairment. It is critical to understand how altered gravity affects physiology on the cellular, molecular, and gene level in order to accurately assess health risks and to develop effective countermeasures. Ground-based microgravity simulators such as random positioning machines (RPMs) are used to produce some of the biological effects of altered gravity on different cell types and organisms. Real-time imaging during simulations are of particular interest as we can study how basic cell functions such as cell division, cell migration, and proliferation progress under microgravity conditions. However, design limitations of present microgravity simulators such as susceptibility to parasitic vibration and displacement of the sample from the center of rotation challenge the accuracy of experiment results and live images. We have developed a cell culture sample holder module suitable for live microscopic imaging on an RPM. CAD modeling and 3D printing technology were used to implement modifications to the sample holder and to install a digital microscope to perform live bright-field and fluorescent imaging. Vibration damping materials were also investigated to allow for stable imaging while the microgravity simulator was within a cell culture incubator. Novel methods and hardware modifications for improving live cell imaging on ground-based microgravity simulators were proposed and discussed.","[{""submissionId"":20180005355,""id"":""49df819bd01a42679229888493d904da"",""publicationDate"":""2018-07-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNX13AJ45A""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180005355

It was found that headdown BR led to decreases in both fast-twitch and slow-twitch fiber areas in both muscles, and there was evidence of remodeling of the ultrastructure in both muscles. The activities of beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and citrate synthase were reduced during BR, but phosphofructokinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities did not change. The results indicate that 30-d exposure to simulated microgravity decreased the capacity for aerobic energy supply of human skeletal muscle and led to a disorganization of the contractile machinery.","[{""volume"":""60"",""submissionId"":19890058136,""issn"":""0095-6562"",""id"":""bc6fe5c818d747338b8a70243a4513c6"",""publicationName"":""Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine"",""publicationDate"":""1989-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19890058136

The interdependence of the three physiological systems represented by this SRP (i.e., skeletal, muscular and cardiovascular) supports a level of discussion on system integration that is now appreciated by the Chief Scientist of the Human Research Program (HRP). The Evidence Reports cover the effects of microgravity on muscle, ranging from the cellular and molecular levels to whole muscle function. The reports also addressed other factors related to muscle (e.g., neural influences, insulin resistance, heat stress, and nutrition) that will serve as a basis for future discussions on the integration of physiological systems and the response to microgravity.

20040090016,REPRINT,Impact of weightlessness on muscle function,"[""Tischler, M. E."",""Slentz, M.""]","The most studied skeletal muscles which depend on gravity, ""antigravity"" muscles, are located in the posterior portion of the legs.  Antigravity muscles are characterized generally by a different fiber type composition than those which are considered nonpostural.  The gravity-dependent function of the antigravity muscles makes them particularly sensitive to weightlessness (unweighting) resulting in a substantial loss of muscle protein, with a relatively greater loss of myofibrillar (structural) proteins.  Accordingly alpha-actin mRNA decreases in muscle of rats exposed to microgravity.  In the legs, the soleus seems particularly responsive to the lack of weight-bearing associated with space flight.  The loss of muscle protein leads to a decreased cross-sectional area of muscle fibers, particularly of the slow-twitch, oxidative (SO) ones compared to fast-twitch glycolytic (FG) or oxidative-glycolytic (FOG) fibers.  In some muscles, a shift in fiber composition from SO to FOG has been reported in the adaptation to spaceflight.  Changes in muscle composition with spaceflight have been associated with decreased maximal isometric tension (Po) and increased maximal shortening velocity.  In terms of fuel metabolism, results varied depending on the pathway considered.  Glucose uptake, in the presence of insulin, and activities of glycolytic enzymes are increased by space flight.  In contrast, oxidation of fatty acids may be diminished.  Oxidation of pyruvate, activity of the citric acid cycle, and ketone metabolism in muscle seem to be unaffected by microgravity.","[{""volume"":""8"",""submissionId"":20040090016,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0898-4697"",""id"":""efe5f4c5bc6c40d7b54f21a6393a06fb"",""publicationName"":""ASGSB bulletin :  publication of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""publicationDate"":""1995-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040090016

A."",""Sun, S.""]","Gastrocnemius muscle of mice were analyzed in order to examine the effects of 12 days of microgravity on the oxidative enzyme climate synthase (CS) and the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). The female C57BL/6J mice utilized for this study were part of the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module (CBTM) payload that flew aboard STS-108. Mice were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs) provided by NASA Ames. The flight (FLT) group and the ground control (CON) group each had 12 mice per group. The AEMs that held the CON group operated on a 48-hour delay from the FLT group and were located inside the Orbital Environmental Simulator (OES) at Kennedy Space Center. The temperature, CO2 and relative humidity inside the OES was regulated based on downlinked information from the shuttle middeck. Student T tests were used to compare groups and a p < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Results indicated that CS levels for the FLT group were significantly lower than the CON group while the SOD levels were significantly higher. The CS FLT mean was 19% lower and the SOD FLT mean was 17% higher than the respective CON group means. Although these findings are among the first muscle enzyme values reported for mice from a shuttle mission, these results are similar to some results previously reported for rats exposed to microgravity or hindlimb suspension. The changes seen during the CBTM payload are reflective of the deconditioning that takes place with disuse of the hindlimbs and indicate that muscle enzyme changes induced by disuse deconditioning are similar in both rodent species.","[{""submissionId"":20020074613,""id"":""cb86bae0a5ca4d5ab403ff209e90f95a"",""publicationDate"":""2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20020074613,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""location"":""Arlington, VA United States"",""id"":""959c3a2d13cd4cbb89e3de090180f43b""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20020074613,""endDate"":""2002-11-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""location"":""Arlington, VA United States""}},""meetingId"":""2aebbb8bd83a4d61ad81a09677a0c213"",""id"":""02fb082494e842d4bcc57532e884efd1""}],""name"":""18th ASGSB Annual Meeting Issue"",""location"":""Cape Canaveral, FL"",""id"":""2aebbb8bd83a4d61ad81a09677a0c213"",""startDate"":""2002-11-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020074613

20040141683,REPRINT,Is skeletal muscle ready for long-term spaceflight and return to gravity?,"[""Riley, D. A.""]","It is now clear that prevention of muscle debilitation during spaceflight will require a broader approach than simple exercise aimed at strengthening of the muscle fibers. The levels of several hormones and receptors are altered by unloading and must be returned to homeostasis. Pharmacotherapy and gene transfer strategies to raise the relative level of structural proteins may minimize the problems faced by astronauts in readapting to Earth-gravity. Up to now, we have only minimally exploited microgravity for advancing our understanding of muscle biology. A research laboratory in the space station with a centrifuge facility (gravity control) is essential for conducting basic research in this field. Microgravity has proven an excellent tool for noninvasively perturbing the synthesis of muscle proteins in the search for molecular signals and gene regulatory factors influencing differentiation, growth, maintenance and atrophy of muscle. Understanding the relation between blood flow and interstitial edema and between workload and subsequent structural failure are but two important problems that require serious attention. The roles of hormones and growth factors in regulating gene expression and their microgravity-induced altered production are other urgent issues to pursue. These types of studies will yield information that advances basic knowledge of muscle biology and offers insights into countermeasure design. This knowledge is likely to assist rehabilitation of diseased or injured muscles in humans on Earth, especially individuals in the more vulnerable aging population and persons participating in strenuous sports. Will the skeletal muscle system be prepared for the increased exposure to microgravity and the return to gravity loading without injury when space station is operational? The answer depends in large part on continued access to space and funding of ground-based models and flight experiments. The previous two decades of spaceflight research have described the effects of microgravity on multiple systems. The next generation of experiments promises to be even more exciting as we are challenged to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms of microgravity-induced changes.","[{""volume"":""7"",""submissionId"":20040141683,""issn"":""1569-2574"",""id"":""44550157a1e94cf7b7e623c79b0c1cf5"",""publicationName"":""Advances in space biology and medicine"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""5UO1-NS33472""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040141683

Satellite cells retain the capacity to proliferate and differentiate in vitro and therefore provide a useful model to study postnatal muscle development. Most culture systems used to study postnatal muscle development are limited by the two-dimensional (2-D) confines of the culture dish. Limiting proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells in 2-D could potentially limit cell-cell contacts important for developing the level of organization in skeletal muscle obtained in vivo. Culturing satellite cells on microcarrier beads suspended in the High-Aspect-Ratio-Vessel (HARV) designed by NASA provides a low shear, three-dimensional (3-D) environment to study muscle development. Primary cultures established from anterior tibialis muscles of growing rats (approximately 200 gm) were used for all studies and were composed of greater than 75 % satellite cells. Different inoculation densities did not affect the proliferative potential of satellite cells in the HARV. Plating efficiency, proliferation, and glucose utilization were compared between 2-D flat culture and 3-D HARV culture. Plating efficiency (cells attached - cells plated x 100) was similar between the two culture systems. Proliferation was reduced in HARV cultures and this reduction was apparent for both satellite cells and non-satellite cells. Furthermore, reduction in proliferation within the HARV could not be attributed to reduced substrate availability since glucose levels in media from HARV and 2-D cell culture were similar. Morphologically, microcarrier beads within the HARVS were joined together by cells into three-dimensional aggregates composed of greater than 10 beads/aggregate. Aggregation of beads did not occur in the absence of cells. Myotubes were often seen on individual beads or spanning the surface of two beads. In summary, proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells on microcarrier beads within the HARV bioreactor results in a three dimensional level of organization that could provide a more suitable model to study postnatal muscle development.","[{""submissionId"":19960007786,""id"":""b8008bb6fb27457b8f6fec01e35efd70"",""publicationDate"":""1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG9-656""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19960007786

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether alterations in the mechanical environment (i.e., reduced fluid pressure and blood flow) of the vasculature in hindlimb skeletal muscles from 2-wk hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats induces a structural remodeling of arterial microvessels that may account for these observations. Transverse cross sections were used to determine media cross-sectional area (CSA), wall thickness, outer perimeter, number of media nuclei, and vessel luminal diameter of feed arteries and first-order (1A) arterioles from soleus and the superficial portion of gastrocnemius muscles. Endothelium-dependent dilation (ACh) was also determined. Media CSA of resistance arteries was diminished by hindlimb unloading as a result of decreased media thickness (gastrocnemius muscle) or reduced vessel diameter (soleus muscle). ACh-induced dilation was diminished by 2 wk of hindlimb unloading in soleus 1A arterioles, but not in gastrocnemius 1A arterioles.

20000029478,OTHER,Molecular Signaling in Muscle Plasticity,"[""Epstein, Henry F.""]","Extended spaceflight under microgravity conditions leads to significant atrophy of weight-bearing muscles. Atrophy and hypertrophy are the extreme outcomes of the high degree of plasticity exhibited by skeletal muscle. Stimuli which control muscle plasticity include neuronal, hormonal, nutritional, and mechanical inputs. The mechanical stimulus for muscle is directly related to the work or exercise against a load performed. Little or no work is performed by weight-bearing muscles under microgravity conditions. A major hypothesis is that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) which is associated with integrin at the adherens junctions and costa meres of all skeletal muscles is an integral part of the major mechanism for molecular signaling upon mechanical stimulation in all muscle fibers. Additionally, we propose that myotonic protein kinase (DMPK) and dystrophin (DYSTR) also participate in distinct mechanically stimulated molecular signaling pathways that are most critical in type I and type II muscle fibers, respectively. To test these hypotheses, we will use the paradigms of hindlimb unloading and overloading in mice as models for microgravity conditions and a potential exercise countermeasure, respectively, in mice. We expect that FAK loss-of-function will impair hypertrophy and enhance atrophy in all skeletal muscle fibers whereas DYSTR and DMPK loss-of-function will have similar but more selective effects on Type IT and Type I fibers, respectively. Gene expression will be monitored by muscle-specific creatine kinase M promoter-reporter construct activity and specific MRNA and protein accumulation in the soleus (type I primarily) and plantaris (type 11 primarily) muscles. With these paradigms and assays, the following Specific Project Aims will be tested in genetically altered mice: 1) identify the roles of DYSTR and its pathway; 2) evaluate the roles of the DMPK and its pathway; 3) characterize the roles of FAK and its pathway and 4) genetically analyze the mechanisms and interactions between the FAK, DYSTR, and DMPK-associated pathways in single and specific combinations of mutants. The identification of potential signaling mechanisms may permit future development of pharmacological countermeasures for amelioration and prevention of the microgravity-induced atrophy in extended spaceflight, and the analysis of both overloading and unloading paradigms may provide further support for development of exercise-based countermeasures. Understanding the basic mechanisms of molecular signaling in muscle plasticity may aid our understanding and treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy not only in spaceflight but in similar problems of the aging population, in prolonged bed rest, and in cachexia associated with chronic disease.","[{""submissionId"":20000029478,""id"":""29793a438c714bbcbb197903b150d8b6"",""publicationName"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute"",""publicationDate"":""1999-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""},{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000029478

Very limited data, however, is at hand describing changes in skeletal muscle size and function following manned space missions.  Our current knowledge therefore is mainly based on studies of space flown rats.  It is obvious though that this information, only in part can be extrapolated to humans.  A few bed rest studies have demonstrated that decreases in strength and muscle size are substantial.  At this time, however, the magnitude or time course of such changes either in response to space flight or simulations of microgravity have not been defined.  In the last few years we have employed a human model to simulate unloading of lower limb skeletal muscles that occurs in microgravity.

L.""]","The overall objective of these studies is to elucidate the molecular and cellular alterations that contribute to muscle atrophy in astronauts caused by exposure to microgravity conditions in space. To accomplish this, a three-dimensional model test system was developed using mouse myoblast cells (C2C12). Myoblast cells were grown as three-dimensional aggregates (without scaffolding or other solid support structures) in both modeled microgravity (Rotary Cell Culture System, Synthecon, Inc.) and at unit gravity in coated Petri dishes. Evaluation of H&E stained thin sections of the aggregates revealed the absence of any necrosis. Confocal microscopy evaluations of cells stained with the Live/Dead assay (Molecular Probes) confirmed that viable cells were present throughout the aggregates with an average of only three dead cells observed per aggregate. Preliminary results from gene array analysis (Affymetrix chip U74Av2) showed that approximately 14% of the genes were down regulated (decreased more than 3 fold) and 4% were upregulated in cells exposed to modeled microgravity for 12 hours compared to unit gravity controls. Additional studies using fluorescent phallacidin revealed a decrease in F-actin in the cells exposed to modeled microgravity compared to unit gravity. Myoblast cells grown as aggregates in modeled microgravity exhibited spontaneous differentiation into syncitia while no differentiation was seen in the unit gravity controls. These studies show that 1)the model test system developed is suitable for assessing cellular and molecular alterations in myoblasts; 2) gene expression alterations occur rapidly (within 12 hours) following exposure to modeled microgravity; and 3) modeled microgravity conditions stimulated myoblast cell differentiation. Achieving a greater understanding of the molecular alterations leading to muscle atrophy will eventually enable the development of cell-based countermeasures, which may be valuable for treatment of muscle diseases on Earth and future space explorations.","[{""submissionId"":20060010411,""id"":""c14fec8a5c50424abbe1f2db5bb516f9"",""publicationDate"":""2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20060010411,""name"":""American Society of Cell Biology"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""32069ad354e348cdaca2aff296c5960e""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20060010411,""endDate"":""2004-12-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society of Cell Biology"",""location"":""Washington, DC""}},""meetingId"":""09efaba4fd9645859d4aab913a9dd39e"",""id"":""52268ed672ef405ab6abd094ad8968b9""}],""name"":""American Society of Cell Biology"",""location"":""Washington, DC"",""id"":""09efaba4fd9645859d4aab913a9dd39e"",""startDate"":""2004-12-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20060010411

Humans in the microgravity environment of space, within our currently developed space vehicles, are exposed to various periods of skeletal muscle unloading (unweighting). Unloading of skeletal muscle both on Earth and during spaceflight results in remodeling of muscle (atrophic response) as an adaptation to the reduced loads placed upon it. As a result, there are decrements in skeletal muscle strength, fatigue resistance, motor performance, and connective tissue integrity. This normal adaptive response to the microgravity environment is for the most part of little consequence within the space vehicle per se but may become a liability resulting in an increased risk of crewmember physical failure during extravehicular activities or abrupt transitions to environments of increased gravity (such as return to Earth or landing on another planetary body).","[{""submissionId"":20050223565,""id"":""f2f7d6728cfd459d8517b84c9b8504a7"",""publicationDate"":""2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20050223565,""endDate"":""2004-04-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Animal Research in Support of Human Space Exploration"",""location"":""Woods Hole, MA"",""id"":""0263d90b1e5141749cd3c635d632d3b1"",""startDate"":""2004-04-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050223565

19930017924,CONTRACTOR_REPORT,Growth factor involvement in tension-induced skeletal muscle growth,"[""Vandenburgh, Herman H.""]","Long-term manned space travel will require a better understanding of skeletal muscle atrophy which results from microgravity. Astronaut strength and dexterity must be maintained for normal mission operations and for emergency situations. Although exercise in space slows the rate of muscle loss, it does not prevent it. A biochemical understanding of how gravity/tension/exercise help to maintain muscle size by altering protein synthesis and/or degradation rate should ultimately allow pharmacological intervention to prevent muscle atrophy in microgravity. The overall objective is to examine some of the basic biochemical processes involved in tension-induced muscle growth. With an experimental in vitro system, the role of exogenous and endogenous muscle growth factors in mechanically stimulated muscle growth are examined. Differentiated avian skeletal myofibers can be 'exercised' in tissue culture using a newly developed dynamic mechanical cell stimulator device which simulates different muscle activity patterns. Patterns of mechanical activity which significantly affect muscle growth and metabolic characteristics were found. Both exogenous and endogenous growth factors are essential for tension-induced muscle growth. Exogenous growth factors found in serum, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and steroids, are important regulators of muscle protein turnover rates and mechanically-induced muscle growth. Endogenous growth factors are synthesized and released into the culture medium when muscle cells are mechanically stimulated. At least one family of mechanically induced endogenous factors, the prostaglandins, help to regulate the rates of protein turnover in muscle cells. Endogenously synthesized IGF-1 is another. The interaction of muscle mechanical activity and these growth factors in the regulation of muscle protein turnover rates with our in vitro model system is studied.","[{""submissionId"":19930017924,""id"":""720c919263944640840bb8ac25be3721"",""publicationDate"":""1993-04-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG2-414""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19930017924

To achieve this aim, rats were exposed to 14 days of head-down suspension (HDS) or cage control (CC) conditions. On day 14, norepinephrine (NE) synthesis was blocked with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, and the rate of NE depletion after synthesis blockade was used to estimate SNS activity in the left ventricle, spleen, and soleus muscle during treadmill exercise at 75% of maximal oxygen uptake. When compared with CC rats, the sympathetic response to exercise in HDS rats was characterized by a lower rate of NE depletion in the left ventricle (-82%) and spleen (-42%). The rate of NE depletion in the soleus muscle was 47% higher. These differences could contribute to the decrement in aerobic capacity of HDS rats by impairing their ability to augment cardiac output and to redirect blood flow to actively contracting skeletal muscle during exercise.","[{""volume"":""272"",""submissionId"":20040173031,""issue"":""2 Pt 2"",""issn"":""0002-9513"",""id"":""6613c2aa68334e67bca0e181b7448a21"",""publicationName"":""The American journal of physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1997-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040173031

L.""]","Exposure to microgravity or models designed to mimic the unloaded condition, such as bed rest in humans and hindlimb unloading (HU) in rats leads to skeletal muscle atrophy, a loss in peak force and power, and an increased susceptibility to fatigue. The posterior compartment muscles of the lower leg (calf muscle group) appear to be particularly susceptible. Following only 1 wk in space or HU, rat soleus muscle showed a 30 to 40% loss in wet weight. After 3 wk of HU, almost all of the atrophied soleus fibers showed a significant increase in maximal shortening velocity (V(sub 0)), while only 25 to 30 % actually transitioned to fast fibers. The increased V(sub 0), was protective in that it reduced the decline in peak power associated with the reduced peak force. When the soleus is stimulated in situ following HU or zero-g one observes an increased rate and extent of fatigue, and in the former the increased fatigue is associated with a more rapid depletion of muscle glycogen and lactate production. Our working hypothesis is that following HU or spaceflight in rats and bed rest or spaceflight in humans limb skeletal muscles during contractile activity depend more on carbohydrates and less on fatty acids for their substrate supply. Baldwin et al. found 9 days of spaceflight to reduce by 37% the ability of both the high and low oxidative regions of the vastus muscle to oxidize long-chain fatty acids. This decline was not associated with any change in the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle or oxidation pathway. The purpose of the current research was to establish the extent of functional change in the slow type I and fast type H fibers of the human calf muscle following 17 days of spaceflight, and determine the cellular mechanisms of the observed changes. A second goal was to study the effectiveness of high resistance isotonic and isometric exercise in preventing the deleterious functional changes associated with unloading.","[{""submissionId"":20000020591,""id"":""bd61f0d3bce94253a2e07dee58aead82"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAS9-18768"",""NAG5-6058""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""},{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000020591

20170005225,PRESENTATION,Implicit Formulation of Muscle Dynamics in OpenSim,"[""Humphreys, Brad"",""Dembia, Chris"",""Lewandowski, Beth "",""Van Den Bogert, Antonie""]","Astronauts lose bone and muscle mass during spaceflight. Exercise countermeasure is the primary method for counteracting bone and muscle mass loss in space. New spacecraft exercise device concepts are currently being developed for the NASAs new crew exploration vehicle. The NASA Digital Astronaut Project (DAP) uses computational modeling to help determine if the new exercise devices will be effective as countermeasures. The NASA Digital Astronaut Project is developing the ability to utilize predictive simulation to provide insight into the change in kinematics and kinetics with a change in device and gravitational environment (1-g versus 0-g). For example, in space exercise the subject's body weight is applied in addition to the loads prescribed for musculoskeletal maintenance. How and where these loads are applied obviously directly impacts bone and tissue loads. Additionally, due to space vehicle structural requirements, exercise devices are often placed on vibration isolation systems. This changes the apparent impedance or stiffness of the device as seen by the user. Data collection under these conditions is often impractical and limited. Predictive modeling provides a means to have a virtual subject to test hypotheses. Predictive simulation provides a virtual subject for which we are able to perform studies such as sensitivity to device loading and vibration isolation without the need for laboratory kinematic or kinetic test data.Direct Collocation optimization provides an efficient means to perform task based optimization and predictive modeling. It is relatively straight forward to structure a physical exercise task in a Direct Collocation mathematical formulation: perform a motion such that you start at an initial pose, achieve a given amount of deflection i.e a squat, return to the initial pose, and minimize muscle activation cost. Direct Collocation is advantageous in that it does not require numerical integration to evaluate the objective function. Instead, the system dynamics are transformed to discrete time and the optimizer is constrained such that the solution is not considered to be a valid unless the dynamic equations are satisfied at all time points. The simulation and optimization are effectively done simultaneously. Due to the implicit integration, time steps can be more coarse than in a differential equation solver. In a gait scenario this means that that the model constraints and cost function are evaluated at 100 nodes in the gait cycle versus 10,000 integration steps in a variable-step forward dynamic simulation. Furthermore, no time is wasted on accurate simulations of movements that are far from the optimum. Constrained optimization algorithms require a Jacobian matrix that contains the partial derivatives of each of the dynamic constraints with respect to of each of the state and control variables at all time points. This is a large but sparse matrix. An implicit dynamics formulation requires computation of the dynamic residuals f as a function of the states x and their derivatives, and controls u:f(x, dxdt, u) 0If the dynamics of musculoskeletal system are formulated implicitly, the Jacobian elements are often available analytically, eliminating the need for numerical differentiation; this is obviously computationally advantageous.

F.""]","Space flight-induced muscle atrophy/neuromuscular degradation and the consequent decrements in crew-member performance are of increasing concern as mission duration lengthens, and planetary exploration after extended space flight is planned. Pre- to post-flight strength measures have demonstrated that specific countermeasures, such as resistive exercise, are effective at countering microgravity-induced muscle atrophy and preventing decrements in muscle strength. However, in-flight assessment/monitoring of exercise countermeasure effectiveness will be essential during exploration class missions due to their duration. The ability to modify an exercise countermeasure prescription based on such real-time information will allow each individual crew member to perform the optimal amount and type of exercise countermeasure to maintain performance. In addition, such measures can be used to determine if a crew member is physically capable of performing a particular mission-related task during exploration class missions. The challenges faced in acquiring such data are those common to all space operations, namely the requirement for light-weight, low power, mechanically reliable technologies that make valid measurements in microgravity, in this case of muscle strength/neuromuscular function. Here we describe a simple, light-weight, low power, non-invasive device, known as the Myotonometer, that measures tissue stiffness as an indirect measure of muscle contractile state and muscle force production. Repeat myotonometer measurements made at the same location on the surface of the rectis femoris muscle (as determined using a 3D locator device, SEM plus or minus 0.34 mm) were shown to be reproducible over time at both maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and at rest in a total of 17 sedentary subjects assessed three times over a period of seven days. In addition, graded voluntary isometric force production (i.e. 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100% of MVC) during knee extension was shown to be significantly (p less than 0.01) correlated with contemporaneous myotonometer measurements made on the rectis femoris muscle in a total of 16 healthy subjects (8 males, 8 females). Further-more, this device has been operationally tested during parabolic flight demonstrating its suitability for use in a microgravity environment. Our data indicates that the Myotonometer is a viable surrogate measure of muscle contractile state/tone and of muscle strength/force production. Additional studies are required to assess the suitability of this technique for assessing these measures in de-conditioned subjects such as crew-members.","[{""submissionId"":20070009946,""id"":""94b9aee71c464272bd5bbea42776d755"",""publicationDate"":""2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20070009946,""endDate"":""2007-04-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""International Gravitational Physiology Meeting"",""location"":""San Antonio, TX"",""id"":""01f0b7396bb5445eae7debb98f29fe6d"",""startDate"":""2007-04-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070009946

Although determination of risk has been a focus for NASA research, data examining systemic (i.e., multi- or pan-tissue) responses to space flight are sparse. To perform our analysis, we utilized the NASA GeneLab database which is a publicly available repository containing a wide array of omics results from experiments conducted with: i) with different flight conditions (space shuttle (STS) missions vs. International Space Station (ISS); ii) a variety of tissues; and 3) assays that measure epigenetic, transcriptional, and protein expression changes. Meta-analysis of the transcriptomic data from 7 different murine and rat data sets, examining tissues such as liver, kidney, adrenal gland, thymus, mammary gland, skin, and skeletal muscle (soleus, extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius) revealed for the first time, the existence of potential master regulators coordinating systemic responses to microgravity in rodents. We identified p53, TGF1 and immune related pathways as the highly prevalent pan-tissue signaling pathways that are affected by microgravity. Some variability in the degree of change in their expression across species, strain and time of flight was also observed. Interestingly, while certain skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius and soleus) exhibited an overall down-regulation of these genes, some other muscle types such as the extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior and quadriceps, showed an up-regulated expression, indicative of potential compensatory mechanisms to prevent microgravity-induced atrophy. Key genes isolated by unbiased systems analyses displayed a major overlap between tissue types and flight conditions and established TGF1 to be the most connected gene across all data sets. Finally, a set of microgravity responsive miRNA signature was identified and based on their predicted functional state and subsequent impact on health, a theoretical health risk score was calculated. The genes and miRNAs identified from our analyses can be targeted for future research involving efficient countermeasure design. Our study thus exemplifies the utility of GeneLab data repository to aid in the process of performing novel hypothesis based spaceflight research aimed at elucidating the global impact of environmental stressors at multiple biological scales.","[{""submissionId"":20170011266,""id"":""483663c820524a73890eae779683cf4b"",""publicationDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20170011266,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States"",""id"":""9ca1b53b06f04ddfbb581f336ce57a03""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170011266,""endDate"":""2017-10-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""1dfe5d7eae4e45d68755d6f6459bf5f3"",""id"":""5ddc85507d1349b0a70c15e0e6d01cf6""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Seattle, WA"",""id"":""1dfe5d7eae4e45d68755d6f6459bf5f3"",""startDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C"",""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20180000833,""title"":""Systemic Microgravity Response: Utilizing GeneLab to Develop Hypotheses for Spaceflight Risks""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170011266

Hence, we examined four male astronauts (group mean approximately 43 years, 86 kg and 183 cm) before and after a 17-day spaceflight (Space Transport System-78). Knee extensor muscle function was measured during maximal bilateral voluntary isometric and iso-inertial concentric, and eccentric actions. Cross-sectional area (CSA) of the knee extensor and flexor, and gluteal muscle groups was assessed by means of magnetic resonance imaging. The decrease in strength (P<0.05) across different muscle actions after spaceflight amounted to 10%.

E."",""Xun, L.""]","The cytoplasmic volume-to-myonucleus ratio in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles of juvenile rats after 5.4 days of microgravity was studied. Three groups of rats (n = 8 each) were used. The experimental group (space rats) was flown aboard the space shuttle Discovery (NASA, STS-48), while two ground-based groups, one hindlimb suspended (suspended rats), one non-suspended (control), served as controls. Single fibre analysis revealed a significant decrease in cross-sectional area (microns2) in the gastrocnemius for both the space and the suspended rats; in the tibialis anterior only the suspended rats showed a significant decrease. Myonuclei counts (myonuclei per mm) in both the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius were significantly increased in the space rats but not in the suspended rats. The mean myonuclear volume (individual nuclei: microns3) in tibialis anterior fibres from the space rats, and in gastrocnemius fibres from both the space and the suspended rats, was significantly lower than that in the respective control group. Estimation of the total myonuclear volume (microns3 per.mm), however, revealed no significant differences between the three groups in either the tibialis anterior or gastrocnemius. The described changes in the cross-sectional area and myonuclei numbers resulted in significant decreases in the cytoplasmic volume-to-myonucleus ratio (microns3 x 10(3)) in both muscles and for both space and suspended rats (tibialis anterior; 15.6 +/- 0.6 (space), 17.2 +/- 1.0 (suspended), 20.8 +/- 0.9 (control): gastrocnemius; 13.4 +/- 0.4 (space) and 14.9 +/- 1.1 (suspended) versus 18.1 +/- 1.1 (control)). These results indicate that even short periods of unweighting due to microgravity or limb suspension result in changes in skeletal muscle fibres which lead to significant decreases in the cytoplasmic volume-to-myonucleus ratio.","[{""volume"":""17"",""submissionId"":20040173126,""issue"":""5"",""issn"":""0142-4319"",""id"":""2a4d7a0c65ad4d79839ea7f6d9d5967f"",""publicationName"":""Journal of muscle research and cell motility"",""publicationDate"":""1996-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""R29 NR02204""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040173126

We found:  increases in the myocyte and its nuclear area, ""fragmentation"" of nucleoli, appearance of neuritic ""aneurysms"", decreased growth in the presence of ""trophic"" factors, and decreased yolk utilization.  The effects were most notable at 1-10 rpm and depended on the onset and duration of rotation.  Some parameters returned to near control values within 48 hrs after cessation of rotation.  Cells from cultures rotated at higher speeds (>50 rpm) appeared comparable to controls.  Compensation by centrifugal forces may account for this finding.  Our data are consistent, in principle, with effects on other, flighted cells and suggest that ""vector-free"" gravity may simulate certain aspects of microgravity.

We studied brief autonomic and haemodynamic transients provoked by graded Valsalva manoeuvres in astronauts on Earth and in space, and tested the hypothesis that exposure to microgravity impairs sympathetic as well as vagal baroreflex responses. We recorded the electrocardiogram, finger photoplethysmographic arterial pressure, respiration and peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic activity in four healthy male astronauts (aged 38-44 years) before, during and after the 16 day Neurolab space shuttle mission. Astronauts performed two 15 s Valsalva manoeuvres at each pressure, 15 and 30 mmHg, in random order. Although no astronaut experienced presyncope after the mission, microgravity provoked major changes. For example, the average systolic pressure reduction during 30 mmHg straining was 27 mmHg pre-flight and 49 mmHg in flight. Increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity during straining were also much greater in space than on Earth. For example, mean normalized sympathetic activity increased 445% during 30 mmHg straining on earth and 792% in space. However, sympathetic baroreflex gain, taken as the integrated sympathetic response divided by the maximum diastolic pressure reduction during straining, was the same in space and on Earth. In contrast, vagal baroreflex gain, particularly during arterial pressure reductions, was diminished in space. This and earlier research suggest that exposure of healthy humans to microgravity augments arterial pressure and sympathetic responses to Valsalva straining and differentially reduces vagal, but not sympathetic baroreflex gain.","[{""volume"":""538"",""submissionId"":20040088547,""issue"":""Pt 1"",""issn"":""0022-3751"",""id"":""28a1bcc52fdb4aca83c359f3c76e5df5"",""publicationName"":""The Journal of physiology"",""publicationDate"":""2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""UO1HL-56417""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088547

Calf muscle strength was examined before SF and BR; on days 2, 8, and 12 during SF and BR; and on days 2 and 8 of recovery. Muscle biopsies were obtained before and within 3 h after SF (gastrocnemius and soleus) and BR (soleus) before reloading. Maximal isometric calf strength and the force-velocity characteristics were unchanged with SF or BR. Additionally, neither SF nor BR had any effect on fiber composition or fiber size of the calf muscles studied. In summary, no changes in calf muscle strength and morphology were observed after the 17-day SF and BR. Because muscle strength is lost during unloading, both during spaceflight and on the ground, these data suggest that the testing sequence employed during the SF and BR may have served as a resistance training countermeasure to attenuate whole muscle strength loss.","[{""volume"":""91"",""submissionId"":20040112406,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""8750-7587"",""id"":""bdd21f8d98074626abec82dc4b147156"",""publicationName"":""Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. :  1985)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040112406

E.""]","During long-duration spaceflight missions, astronauts exposure to microgravity without adequate countermeasures can result in losses of muscular strength and endurance, as well as loss of bone mass. As a countermeasure to this challenge, astronauts engage in resistive exercise during spaceflight to maintain their musculoskeletal function. The Hybrid Ultimate Lifting Kit (HULK) has been designed as a prototype exercise device for an exploration-class vehicle; the HULK features a much smaller footprint than previous devices such as the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) on the International Space Station (ISS), which makes the HULK suitable for extended spaceflight missions in vehicles with limited volume. As current ISS exercise countermeasure equipment represents an improvement over previous generations of such devices, the ARED is being employed as a benchmark of functional performance. This project involves the development of a biomechanical model of the deadlift exercise, and is novel in that it is the first exercise analyzed in this context to include the upper limbs in the loading path, in contrast to the squat, single-leg squat, and heel raise exercises also being modeled by our team. OpenSim software is employed to develop these biomechanical models of humans performing resistive exercises to assess and improve the new exercise device designs. Analyses include determining differences in joint and muscle forces when using different loading strategies with the device, comparing and contrasting with the ARED benchmark, and determining whether the loading is sufficient to maintain musculoskeletal health. During data collection, the number of repetitions, load, cadence, stance, and grip width are controlled in order to facilitate comparisons between loading configurations. To date, data have been collected for two human subjects performing the deadlift exercise on the HULK device using two different loading conditions. Recorded data include motion capture, electromyography (EMG), ground reaction forces, device load cell data, photos and videos, and anthropometric data. Work is ongoing to perform biomechanical analyses including inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics to compare different versions of the deadlift model in order to determine which provides an appropriate level of detail to study this exercise.

Two biopsy sites per muscle were identified that provided samples not degraded by the biopsy procedure. Both sites contained sufficient numbers fibers for determining changes in fiber type percentages and size. There was adequate bilateral symmetry regarding fiber type composition in the left and right muscles such that a total of four times points can be compared. The ESOP cage did not cause atrophy of deltoid muscle fibers; this means that microgravity-induced atrophy should be detectable. As expected, muscle excision stimulated muscle IgM and IgG muscle autoantibody production. Nonrestrained control animals suppressed this response whereas restrained monkeys showed an abnormally pronounced response indicative a compromised immune system. The presence of ESOP cage-induced changes in the immune response may mask spaceflight-induced effects. The ESOP cage modified the dominant hand operation of the PTS.

As a key alternative to hormone replacement therapy, ectopic production of hGH, growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), and IGF-I will be studied for its potential on muscle mass impact in transgenic mice under simulated microgravity. Expression of either hGH or IGF-I would provide a chronic source of a growth-promoting protein whose biosynthesis or secretion is shut down in space. Muscle expression of the IGF-I transgene has demonstrated about a 20% increase in hind limb muscle mass over control nontransgenic litter mates. These recent experiments, also establish the utility of hind-limb suspension in mice as a workable model to study atrophy in weight bearing muscles. Thus, transgenic mice will be used in hind-limb suspension models to determine the role of GH/IGF-I on maintenance of muscle mass and whether concentric exercises might act in synergy with hormone treatment. As a means to engineer and ensure long-term protein production that would be workable in humans, gene therapy technology will be used by to monitor muscle mass preservation during hind-limb suspension, after direct intramuscular injection of a genetically engineered muscle-specific vector expressing GHRH. Effects of this gene-based therapy will be assessed in both fast twitch (medial gastrocnemius) and slow twitch muscle (soleus). End-points include muscle size, ultrastructure, fiber type, and contractile function, in normal animals, hind limb suspension, and reambutation.","[{""submissionId"":20000029476,""id"":""31ed1c8d112a4d1597007f622dc22c70"",""publicationName"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute"",""publicationDate"":""1999-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""},{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000029476

Evidence has been found for muscular and neural changes occurring as a result of reentry stresses. It is suggested that a data base be established for quantizing muscle function with electromyography, measurements of force output, and length measurement.

Cells were isolated from the thigh muscle tissue of 12 day embryos and were cultured for up to 14 days in the hollow fiber environment. Cells proliferated to confluency within several days, and fusion into multinucleated myotubes was then apparent. Fibers were stretched by a built-in spring mechanism to hold the fiber tightly at the center of rotation, and sections of the fiber were removed at 3, 7 and 14 days for electron microscopic analysis. When the Clinostat is rotated in the horizontal position, the gravity vector approaches zero and the cells are in an environment that simulates microgravity. Control experiments consist of one fiber rotated in the vertical position in the clinostat and another fiber that is held in a horizontal configuration in a comparable sized tube that is not rotated at all. Examination of skeletal muscle cells by electron microscopy revealed that myoblast fusion and myofibril accumulation were extensive. Two general conclusions were apparent. First, muscle cells undergo the normal progression of proliferation, fusion, and myofibril assembly in the presence of simulated microgravity for the first week in culture. After 14 days, however, many muscle fibers undergo degeneration such that myofibrillar structures are not extensive or well organized. Second, although no major abnormalities in myofibril assembly were detected in Clinostat-rotated cultures in comparison to controls that were not rotated in a Clinostat, the myofibrils in non-rotated controls tend to be more highly organized than those in either horizontally or vertically rotated Clinostat samples.","[{""submissionId"":19900010108,""id"":""dd676b7adeb04d3ba57f698f5936bca8"",""publicationName"":""Research Reports: 1989 NASA(ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program"",""publicationDate"":""1989-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NGT-01-008-021""]",undefined,"[""Materials Processing""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19900010108

In this study, we investigated how weightlessness altered the functional properties of single fast and slow striated muscle fibers. Physiological studies were carried out to test the hypothesis that microgravity causes fiber atrophy, a decreased peak force (Newtons), tension (Newtons/cross-sectional area) and power, an elevated peak rate of tension development (dp/dt), and an increased maximal shortening velocity (V(sub o)) in the slow type I fiber, while changes in the fast-twitch fiber are restricted to atrophy and a reduced peak force. For each fiber, we determined the peak force (P(sub o)), V(sub o), dp/dt, the force-velocity relationship, peak power, the power-force relationship, the force-pCa relationship, and fiber stiffness. Biochemical studies were carried out to assess the effects of weightlessness on the enzyme and substrate profile of the fast- and slow-twitch fibers. We predicted that microgravity would increase resting muscle glycogen and glycolytic metabolism in the slow fiber type, while the fast-twitch fiber enzyme profile would be unaltered. The increased muscle glycogen would in part result from an elevated hexokinase and glycogen synthase. The enzymes selected for study represent markers for mitochondrial function (citrate synthase and 0-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase), glycolysis (Phosphofructokinase and lactate dehydrogenase), and fatty acid transport (Carnitine acetyl transferase). The substrates analyzed will include glycogen, lactate, adenosine triphosphate, and phosphocreatine.","[{""submissionId"":20000024888,""id"":""3614adf605b642a9a58960de5debb547"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG2-636""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000024888
19980003447,CONTRACTOR_REPORT,Development of Human Muscle Protein Measurement with MRI,"[""Lin, Chen"",""Evans, Harlan"",""Leblanc, Adrian D.""]","It is known that micro-gravity has a strong influence on the human musculoskeletal system. A number of studies have shown that significant changes in skeletal muscles occur in both space flight and bedrest simulation. In our 5 week bedrest study, the cross-sectional area of soleus-gastrocnemius decreased about 12% while the cross-sectional area of anterior calf muscles decreased about 4%. Using volume measurements, these losses increased after 17 weeks to approximately 30% and 21% respectively. Significant muscle atrophy was also found on the SL-J crew members after only 8 days in space. It is important that these effects are fully understood so that countermeasures can be developed. The same knowledge might also be useful in preventing muscle atrophy related to other medical problems. A major problem with anatomical measurements of muscle during bed rest and microgravity is the influence of fluid shifts and water balance on the measurement of muscle volume, especially when the exposure duration is short and the atrophy is relatively small. Fluid shifts were documented in Skylab by visual observations of blood vessel distention, rapid changes in limb volume, center of mass measurements and subjective descriptions such as puffy faces and head fullness. It has been reported that the muscle water content of biopsied soleus muscles decreased following 8 hours of head down tilt bed rest. Three aspects of fluid shifts that can affect volume measurements are: first, the shift of fluid that occurs whenever there is a change from upright to a recumbent position and vice versa; second, the potential for fluid accumulation in the lower limbs resulting from muscle damage caused by overextending atrophied muscle or swelling caused by deconditioned precapillary sphincter muscles during reambulation; third, the net change of hydration level during and after bed rest or spaceflight. Because of these transitory fluid shifts, muscle protein is expected to represent muscle capacity better than does muscle volume. The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of using MRI to quantify of muscle protein and water content changes in muscle.","[{""submissionId"":19980003447,""id"":""0167f8e097d940fd89e5258702cb2324"",""publicationDate"":""1997-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NCC9-36""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19980003447

E."",""Perusek, G."",""Orlando, T.""]","Exercise in microgravity is one of the most promising countermeasures to the dual problems of space flight-induced bone loss and muscle atrophy. Although exercise in microgravity has been studied extensively from a metabolic standpoint, little research has focused on the efficacy of different forms of exercise for maintaining musculoskeletal integrity. Exercise protocols have not been effective in preventing muscle atrophy and bone loss during space flight, especially in the lower extremities. In 1-G, however, animal experiments have clearly indicated that: (1) certain bone strains and strain rates do stimulate bone deposition, and (2) repetitive loading of the lower extremity can increase osteonal bone formation even as proximally as the vertebral column. Such studies have also indicated that a relatively small number of appropriate loading cycles may lead to bone deposition. This suggests that an optimal exercise regimen might be able to maintain bone and muscle integrity during space flight. Since there is evidence that the bones and muscles of the lower limbs are particularly affected by space flight, the present study addressed two major aims: (1) quantify externally applied impact loads and rates of loading under the feet during tethered jumping exercises, and (2) determine the amount of eccentric and concentric whole-muscle activity during these jumping exercises in true and in simulated zero-gravity.","[{""submissionId"":20000020486,""id"":""0fe743cb315e419cb372e394a96748be"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG5-4086""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""},{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000020486

Hindlimb suspension of laboratory rats, as a model for microgravity, also shows marked atrophy of gravity-dependent muscles along with a reduced gain in body weight. Suspended rats exhibit enhanced sensitivity to insulin-induced glucose uptake when compared with normal control rats and resistance to insulin action when compared with control rats matched similarly for reduced body weight gain. These changes are accompanied by decreased insulin binding and tyrosine kinase activity in soleus but not plantaris muscle, unchanged glucose uptake by perfused hindlimb and decreased sensitivity but not responsiveness to insulin-induced suppression of net proteolysis in hindlimb skeletal muscle.

20040102090,REPRINT,Changes in gene expression and signal transduction in microgravity,"[""Hughes-Fulford, M.""]","Studies from space flights over the past three decades have demonstrated that basic physiological changes occur in humans during space flight. These changes include cephalic fluid shifts, loss of fluid and electrolytes, loss of muscle mass, space motion sickness, anemia, reduced immune response, and loss of calcium and mineralized bone. The cause of most of these manifestations is not known and until recently, the general approach was to investigate general systemic changes, not basic cellular responses to microgravity. This laboratory has recently studied gene growth and activation of normal osteoblasts (MC3T3-El) during spaceflight. Osteoblast cells were grown on glass coverslips and loaded in the Biorack plunger boxes. The osteoblasts were launched in a serum deprived state, activated in microgravity and collected in microgravity. The osteoblasts were examined for changes in gene expression and signal transduction. Approximately one day after growth activation significant changes were observed in gene expression in 0-G flight samples. Immediate early growth genes/growth factors cox-2, c-myc, bcl2, TGF beta1, bFGF and PCNA showed a significant diminished mRNA induction in microgravity FCS activated cells when compared to ground and 1-G flight controls. Cox-1 was not detected in any of the samples. There were no significant differences in the expression of reference gene mRNA between the ground, 0-G and 1-G samples. The data suggest that quiescent osteoblasts are slower to enter the cell cycle in microgravity and that the lack of gravity itself may be a significant factor in bone loss in spaceflight. Preliminary data from our STS 76 flight experiment support our hypothesis that a basic biological response occurs at the tissue, cellular, and molecular level in 0-G.

Our rationale for this approach is that, if countermeasures can be developed to regulate these early events, we could avoid having to deal with the multiple cascades of events that occur downstream from the initial event. One of our major findings is that hind limb suspension causes an early and sustained increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca (2+)](sub i)). In most cells the consequences of changes in ([Ca (2+)](sub i))depend on the amplitude, frequency and duration of the Ca(2+) signal and on other factors in the intracellular environment. We propose that muscle remodeling in microgravity represents a change in the balance among several CA(2+) regulated signal transduction pathways, in particular those involving the transcription factors NFAT and NFkB and the pro-apoptotic protein BAD. Other Ca(2+) sensitive pathways involving PKC, ras, rac, and CaM kinase II may also contribute to muscle remodeling.","[{""submissionId"":20000029479,""id"":""3c77a350ec46440290f4ea2482694f8f"",""publicationName"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute"",""publicationDate"":""1999-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""},{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000029479

Cells were prepared from skeletal or cardiac muscle tissue of 12 day embryos and were cultured for up to 7 days in the hollow fiber environment. Light microscopy revealed that cells proliferated to confluency over this period of time and fusion was apparent in the skeletal muscle cells. Once it was verified that cells would grow to confluency, additional XM-80 fibers containing cells were placed in a Clinostat in the horizontal position at 100 rpm. Fibers were stretched by a built-in spring mechanism to hold the fiber tightly at the center of rotation. Under these conditions, the gravity vector approaches zero and the cells are in an environment that simulates microgravity. Examination of skeletal muscle cells by electron microscopy revealed that myoblast fusion and myofibril accumulation were extensive. Although data obtained thus far are preliminary, they suggest that myofibril organization in chicken skeletal muscle cultures is somewhat more poorly defined in Clinostat rotated cultures than in controls that were not subjected to Clinostat conditions.","[{""submissionId"":19890012387,""id"":""e8eb4543257c4762a953a2724bf274bf"",""publicationName"":""Alabama Univ., Research Reports: 1988 NASA(ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program"",""publicationDate"":""1988-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Materials Processing""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19890012387

The hypothesis that anticipatory activity is a component of a single neural command for arm movement was tested by monitoring the surface electromyographic activity of the biceps femoris, paraspinals, and deltoid muscles of three subjects during the microgravity phase of parabolic flight. If part of a single command, anticipatory postural activity would be expected to remain intact despite the absence of the body's center of gravity in a reduced gravity environment. However, in at least 75 percent of the microgravity trials anticipatory biceps femoris activity was absent, indicating a separation of postural and agonist muscle activity. Such a finding suggests that anticipatory postural biceps femoris activity may be initiated independently of agonist (deltoid) activity.","[{""volume"":""61"",""submissionId"":19910033063,""issn"":""0095-6562"",""id"":""70aee8e3b03a44fdbb6c3575aae4dd32"",""publicationName"":""Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine"",""publicationDate"":""1990-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAGW-1197""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19910033063

Previous research suggests that susceptible individuals are unable to increase their systemic vascular resistance and plasma noradrenaline concentrations above pre-flight upright levels. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that adaptation to the microgravity of space impairs sympathetic neural responses to upright posture on Earth. We studied six astronauts approximately 72 and 23 days before and on landing day after the 16 day Neurolab space shuttle mission. We measured heart rate, arterial pressure and cardiac output, and calculated stroke volume and total peripheral resistance, during supine rest and 10 min of 60 deg upright tilt. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded in five subjects, as a direct measure of sympathetic nervous system responses. As in previous studies, mean (+/- S.E.M.) stroke volume was lower (46 +/- 5 vs. 76 +/- 3 ml, P = 0.017) and heart rate was higher (93 +/- 1 vs. 74 +/- 4 beats min(-1), P = 0.002) during tilt after spaceflight than before spaceflight. Total peripheral resistance during tilt post flight was higher in some, but not all astronauts (1674 +/- 256 vs. 1372 +/- 62 dynes s cm(-5), P = 0.32). No crew member exhibited orthostatic hypotension or presyncopal symptoms during the 10 min of postflight tilting. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was higher post flight in all subjects, in supine (27 +/- 4 vs. 17 +/- 2 bursts min(-1), P = 0.04) and tilted (46 +/- 4 vs. 38 +/- 3 bursts min(-1), P = 0.01) positions. A strong (r(2) = 0.91-1.00) linear correlation between left ventricular stroke volume and muscle sympathetic nerve activity suggested that sympathetic responses were appropriate for the haemodynamic challenge of upright tilt and were unaffected by spaceflight. We conclude that after 16 days of spaceflight, muscle sympathetic nerve responses to upright tilt are normal.","[{""volume"":""538"",""submissionId"":20040088545,""issue"":""Pt 1"",""issn"":""0022-3751"",""id"":""1231fc02f8794093a7af63cd022ceb5a"",""publicationName"":""The Journal of physiology"",""publicationDate"":""2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088545

Although the regulation of iGH release is well documented, the mechanism(s) of bGH release is unclear. On the basis of changes in bGH and iGH secretion in rats that had been exposed to microgravity conditions, we hypothesized that neural afferents play a role in regulating the release of these hormones. To examine whether bGH secretion can be modulated by afferent input from skeletal muscle, the proximal or distal ends of severed hindlimb fast muscle nerves were stimulated ( approximately 2 times threshold) in anesthetized rats. Plasma bGH increased approximately 250%, and pituitary bGH decreased approximately 60% after proximal nerve trunk stimulation. The bGH response was independent of muscle mass or whether the muscles were flexors or extensors. Distal nerve stimulation had little or no effect on plasma or pituitary bGH. Plasma iGH concentrations were unchanged after proximal nerve stimulation. Although there may be multiple regulatory mechanisms of bGH, the present results demonstrate that the activation of low-threshold afferents from fast skeletal muscles can play a regulatory role in the release of bGH, but not iGH, from the pituitary in anesthetized rats.","[{""volume"":""84"",""submissionId"":20040172710,""issue"":""4"",""issn"":""8750-7587"",""id"":""c858507c6fac40619e40e6ff11af1290"",""publicationName"":""Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. :  1985)"",""publicationDate"":""1998-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""DE-07212""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040172710

These cells are responsive to a variety of environmental cues, including mechanical stimuli. The overall goal of the research is to examine the role of mechanical signalling mechanisms in muscle growth and plasticity through utilisation of cell culture systems where other potential signalling pathways (i.e. chemical and electrical stimuli) are controlled. To explore the effects of decreased mechanical loading on muscle differentiation, mammalian myoblasts are cultured in a bioreactor (rotating cell culture system), a model that has been utilised to simulate microgravity. C2C12 murine myoblasts are cultured on microcarrier beads in a bioreactor and followed throughout differentiation as they form a network of multinucleated myotubes. In comparison with three-dimensional control cultures that consist of myoblasts cultured on microcarrier beads in teflon bags, myoblasts cultured in the bioreactor exhibit an attenuation in differentiation. This is demonstrated by reduced immunohistochemical staining for myogenin and alpha-actinin. Western analysis shows a decrease, in bioreactor cultures compared with control cultures, in levels of the contractile proteins myosin (47% decrease, p < 0.01) and tropomyosin (63% decrease, p < 0.01). Hydrodynamic measurements indicate that the decrease in differentiation may be due, at least in part, to fluid stresses acting on the myotubes. In addition, constraints on aggregate size imposed by the action of fluid forces in the bioreactor affect differentiation. These results may have implications for muscle growth and repair during spaceflight.","[{""volume"":""38"",""submissionId"":20040112671,""issue"":""5"",""issn"":""0140-0118"",""id"":""94162962ef4741fcaf754e5cf1f3c27a"",""publicationName"":""Medical & biological engineering & computing"",""publicationDate"":""2000-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""AR-08231"",""N01-HD-2-3144""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040112671

Although determination of risk has been a focus for NASA research, data examining systemic (i.e., multi- or pan-tissue) responses to space flight are sparse. To perform our analysis, we utilized the NASA GeneLab database which is a publicly available repository containing a wide array of omics results from experiments conducted with: i) with different flight conditions (space shuttle (STS) missions vs. International Space Station (ISS); ii) a variety of tissues; and 3) assays that measure epigenetic, transcriptional, and protein expression changes. Meta-analysis of the transcriptomic data from 7 different murine and rat data sets, examining tissues such as liver, kidney, adrenal gland, thymus, mammary gland, skin, and skeletal muscle (soleus, extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius) revealed for the first time, the existence of potential master regulators coordinating systemic responses to microgravity in rodents. We identified p53, TGF(beta)1 and immune related pathways as the highly prevalent pan-tissue signaling pathways that are affected by microgravity. Some variability in the degree of change in their expression across species, strain and time of flight was also observed. Interestingly, while certain skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius and soleus) exhibited an overall down-regulation of these genes, some other muscle types such as the extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior and quadriceps, showed an up-regulated expression, indicative of potential compensatory mechanisms to prevent microgravity-induced atrophy. Key genes isolated by unbiased systems analyses displayed a major overlap between tissue types and flight conditions and established TGF(beta)1 to be the most connected gene across all data sets. Finally, a set of microgravity responsive miRNA signature was identified and based on their predicted functional state and subsequent impact on health, a theoretical health risk score was calculated. The genes and miRNAs identified from our analyses can be targeted for future research involving efficient countermeasure design. Our study thus exemplifies the utility of GeneLab data repository to aid in the process of performing novel hypothesis based spaceflight research aimed at elucidating the global impact of environmental stressors at multiple biological scales.","[{""submissionId"":20170011208,""id"":""25b88632553340de9645066da72204fe"",""publicationDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20170011208,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States"",""id"":""a230dee8eeb54a6884c2c254dc709763""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170011208,""endDate"":""2017-10-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6c9e353046204ead9e8fec3ee2a19d8f"",""id"":""86aad3afd3054227a61a6fec2c37efa2""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Seattle, WA"",""id"":""6c9e353046204ead9e8fec3ee2a19d8f"",""startDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C"",""NNA16BD14C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170011208

These changes include cephalic fluid shifts, loss of fluid and electrolytes, loss of muscle mass, space motion sickness, anemia, reduced immune response, and loss of calcium and mineralized bone. The cause of most of these manifestations is not known and until recently, the general approach was to investigate general systemic changes, not basic cellular responses to microgravity. Recently analyzed data from the 1973-1974 Skylabs disclose that there is a rise in the systemic hormone, cortisol, which may play a role in bone loss in flight. In two flights where bone growth was measured (Skylabs 3 and 4), the crew members had a significant loss of calcium accompanied by a rise in 24 hour urinary cortisol during the entire flight period. In ground-based work on osteoblasts, we have demonstrated that equivalent amounts of glucocorticoids can inhibit osteoblast cell growth. In addition, this laboratory has recently studied gene growth and activation of mouse osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) during spaceflight. Osteoblast cells were grown on glass coverslips, loaded in the Biorack plunger boxes 18 hours before launch and activated 19 hours after launch in the Biorack incubator under microgravity conditions. The osteoblasts were launched in a serum deprived state, activated and collected in microgravity. Samples were collected at 29 hours after sera activation (0-g, n=4; 1-g, n=4). The osteoblasts were examined for changes in gene expression and cell morphology. Approximately one day after growth activation, remarkable differences were observed in gene expression in 0-g and 1-g flight samples. The 0-g activated cells had increased c-fos mRNA when compared to flight 1-g controls. The message of immediate early growth gene, cox-2 was decreased in the microgravity activated cells when compared to ground or 1-g flight controls. Cox-1 was not detected in any of the samples. There were no significant differences in the expression of actin mRNA between the 0-g and 1-g samples. These data indicate that quiescent osteoblasts are slower to enter the cell cycle in microgravity, suggesting that the force of gravity itself may be a significant factor in bone loss in spaceflight. Preliminary data from our STS 76 flight experiment support our hypothesis that a basic biological response occurs at the tissue, cellular, and molecular level in 0-g. Here we examine ground-based and space flown data on osteoblast growth in ground-based experiments mimicking space flight conditions and in microgravity to simulate lack of gravity stress to help us understand the mechanism of bone loss by experiments.","[{""volume"":""11"",""submissionId"":20040121271,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""1089-988X"",""id"":""c125f7de0f424f579bce6eb7024efda9"",""publicationName"":""Gravitational and space biology bulletin :  publication of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""publicationDate"":""1998-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG2-981"",""NAGW-1244"",""NAG2-1086""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040121271

M."",""Buchanan, P.""]","The limited space flight data suggest that exposure to microgravity decreases muscle strength in humans and muscle mass in lower mammals. Several earth-based models have been used to address the effect of unloading on the human neuromuscular system due to the limited access of biological research to long-term space flight. Bedrest eliminates body weight bearing of both lower limbs. Unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS), where all ambulatory activity is performed on crutches with an elevated sole on the shoe of one foot, has recently been used to unload one lower limb. The results from studies using these two models support their efficacy. The decrease in strength of m. quadriceps femoris, for example, after four to six weeks of bedrest, ULLS or space flight is 20 to 25 percent. The results from the earth-based studies show that this response can be attributed in part to a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the KE which reflects muscle fiber atrophy. The results from the ground based studies also support the limited flight data and show that reductions in strength are larger in lower than upper limbs and in extensor than flexor muscle groups. They also raise issue with the generally held concept that postural muscle is most affected by unweighting. Slow-twitch fibers in lower limb muscles of mixed fiber type composition and muscle composed mainly of slow-twitch fibers do not preferentially atrophy after bedrest or ULLS. Taken together, the data suggest that unloading causes remarkable adaptations in the neuromuscular system of humans. It should be appreciated, however, that this area of research is in its infancy.","[{""volume"":""79"",""submissionId"":19930044721,""issue"":""8"",""issn"":""0015-4148"",""id"":""cc63390d776943dfbcce4e83ca39513f"",""publicationName"":""Florida Medical Association, Journal"",""publicationDate"":""1992-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19930044721

The exercises selected were leg presses, leg (knee) extensions, and hamstring curls. In this 30 week study, 38 male subjects, between the ages of 25 and 50, were divided into four groups. One group performed 5 sets of 8-12 repetitions per set of conventional concentric/eccentric (CON/ECC) exercises. Another group performed only the concentric (CON) movement on the same schedule. The third group performed twice the number of sets in the concentric only mode (CON/CON), and the last group served as controls. We interpret these data as convincing evidence that the eccentric component of heavy resistance training is required along with the concentric for the most effective increase in strength and muscle fiber size in the least time. We also conclude that such heavy exercise of any such muscle group need not consume inordinately long periods of time, and is quite satisfactorily effective when performed on 72 hour centers.","[{""submissionId"":19960003359,""id"":""4521fe81af56441ab8c63c410a56d554"",""publicationDate"":""1990-04-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Japan"",""submissionId"":19960003359,""endDate"":""1990-04-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Nihon University International Symposium on Aerospace Science"",""location"":""Tokyo"",""id"":""0e1d89b0f66f4ee3a22b1e4dac834dbf"",""startDate"":""1990-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19960003359

IVDs are avascular structures consisting of cells that may derive their nutrition and waste removal from the load induced fluid flow into and out of the disc. A diurnal cycle is produced by forces related to weight bearing and muscular activity, and comprised of a supine and erect posture over a 24 hr period. A diurnal cycle will include a disc volume change of approx. 10-13%. However, in space there are little or no diurnal changes because of the microgravity, which removes the gravitational load and compressive forces to the back muscles. The BR model and the etiology of the disc swelling and muscle atrophy could provide insight into those subjects confined to bed for chronic disease/injury and aging. We hypothesize that extremely low-magnitude, high frequency mechanical vibrations will abate the disc degeneration and muscle loss associated with long-term BR.","[{""submissionId"":20070030102,""id"":""2006bceab90048aeb049b89f256345b1"",""publicationDate"":""2007-09-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20070030102,""endDate"":""2007-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""302811fa3846419f8cdc89761314234e"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Bone and Minerarl Research"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""e859b40ee99b48068b51284a7b6d39be"",""id"":""45c827d91c514956a7b9c5f44d5fd3b5""}],""name"":""ASBMR 29th Annual Meeting"",""location"":""Honolulu, HI"",""id"":""e859b40ee99b48068b51284a7b6d39be"",""startDate"":""2007-09-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070030102

20110016708,ABSTRACT,Use It or Lose It: Skeletal Muscle Function and Performance Results from Space Shuttle,"[""Ryder, Jeffrey""]","The Space Shuttle Program provided a wealth of valuable information regarding the adaptations of skeletal muscle to weightlessness. Studies conducted during the Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project (EDOMP) represented ground breaking work on the effects of spaceflight on muscle form and function from applied human research to cellular adaptations. Results from detailed supplementary objective (DSO) 477 demonstrated that muscle strength losses could occur rapidly in response to short-duration spaceflight. The effects of spaceflight-induced unloading were primarily restricted to postural muscles such as those of the back as well as the knee extensors. DSO 606 provided evidence from MRI that the observed strength losses were partially accounted for by a reduction in the size of the individual muscles. Muscle biopsy studies conducted during DSO 475 were able to show muscle atrophy in individual muscle fibers from the quadriceps muscles. Reduced quadriceps muscle size and strength was also observed during the 17-d Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission aboard STS-78. Multiple maximal strength tests were conducted in flight on the calf muscles and it has been hypothesized that these high force contractions may have acted as a countermeasure. Muscle fiber mechanics were studied on calf muscle samples pre- and postflight. While some responses were crewmember specific, the general trend was that muscle fiber force production dropped and shortening velocity increased. The increased shortening velocity helped to maintain muscle fiber power. Numerous rodent studies performed during Shuttle missions suggest that many of the effects reported in Shuttle crewmembers could be due to lesions in the cellular signaling pathways that stimulate protein synthesis as well as an increase in the mechanisms that up-regulate protein breakdown. The results have important implications regarding the overall health and performance capabilities of future crewmembers that will venture beyond low-Earth orbit. Learning Objective: Overview of the Space Shuttle Program regarding adaptive changes in skeletal muscle function and performance, including what was learned from research and what was implemented for countermeasures.","[{""submissionId"":20110016708,""id"":""12d1d2dc5bb84a449827429db2c44cc4"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20110016708,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""52eef7ebc1f9431285c50f1f285e6823""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110016708,""endDate"":""2012-05-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""23fcffb802a247128168fefbeb80d063"",""id"":""4395fe963b6e416ea489321ca425814c""}],""name"":""83rd AsMA Annual Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""Atlanta, GA"",""id"":""23fcffb802a247128168fefbeb80d063"",""startDate"":""2012-05-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110016708

The goal of this flight as in the five untended Russian COSMOS Bion flights and an earlier American Biosatellite flight, was to understand the biomedical and biological effects of a microgravity environment using the non-human primate as human surrogate. The SLS-3/Rhesus Project and COSMOS Primate-BIOS flights all utilized the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta. The ultimate objective of all flights with an animal surrogate has been to evaluate and understand biological mechanisms at both the system and cellular level, thus enabling rational effective countermeasures for future long duration human activity under microgravity conditions and enabling technical application to correction of common human physiological problems within earth's gravity, e.g., muscle strength and reloading, osteoporosis, immune deficiency diseases. Hardware developed for the SLS-3/Rhesus Project was the result of a joint effort with the French Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) extending over the last decade. The flight hardware design and development required implementation of sufficient automation to insure flight crew and animal bio-isolation and maintenance with minimal impact to crew activities. A variety of hardware of varying functional capabilities was developed to support the scientific objectives of the original 22 combined French and American experiments, along with 5 Russian co-investigations, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, and behavioral studies. Unique elements of the Rhesus Research Facility (RRF) included separation of waste for daily delivery of urine and fecal samples for metabolic studies and a psychomotor test system for behavioral studies along with monitored food measurement. As in untended flights, telemetry measurements would allow monitoring of thermoregulation, muscular, and cardiac responses to weightlessness. In contrast, the five completed Cosmos/Bion flights, lacked the metabolic samples and behavioral task monitoring, but did facilitate studies of the neurovestibular system during several of the flights.","[{""submissionId"":19970007004,""issn"":""0148-7191"",""publisher"":""SAE International"",""id"":""5ede5c23f98f48c5ba18421b3f55e87c"",""publicationDate"":""1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Germany"",""submissionId"":19970007004,""endDate"":""1994-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Environmental Systems"",""location"":""Friedrichshafen"",""id"":""2a586d2e41424d6c87ff34252be29e0c"",""startDate"":""1994-06-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""},{""country"":""Germany"",""submissionId"":19970007004,""endDate"":""1994-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Space Environmental Control Systems"",""location"":""Friedrichshafen"",""id"":""9a5987f677cd43e1b639c935dbcee4ba"",""startDate"":""1994-06-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19970007004

Impacts on performance, in terms of fatigue and posture, may occur especially if the task is tedious and repetitive or requires static muscle loading. The glovebox design is a good example of the confined workstation concept. Within the scope of the 'Microgravity Workstation and Restraint Evaluation' project, funded by the NASA Headquarters Life Sciences Division, it was proposed to conduct a series of evaluations in ground, KC-135 and Shuttle environments to investigate the human factors issues concerning confined/unique workstations, such as gloveboxes, and also including crew restraint requirements. As part of the proposed integrated evaluations, two Shuttle Detailed Supplementary Objectives (DSOs) were manifested; one on Space Transportation System (STS)-90 and one on STS-88. The DSO on STS-90 evaluated use of the General Purpose Workstation (GPWS). The STS-88 mission was planned to evaluate a restraint system at the Remote Manipulator System (RMS). In addition, KC- 1 35 flights were conducted to investigate user/workstation/restraint integration for long-duration microgravity use. The scope of these evaluations included workstations and restraints to be utilized in the ISS environment, but also incorporated other workstations/ restraints in an attempt to provide findings/requirements with broader applications across multiple programs (e.g., Shuttle, ISS, and future Lunar-Mars programs). In addition, a comprehensive electronic questionnaire has been prepared and is under review by the Astronaut Office which will compile crewmembers' lessons learned information concerning glovebox and restraint use following their missions. These evaluations were intended to be complementary and were coordinated with hardware developers, users (crewmembers), and researchers. This report is intended to provide a summary of the findings from each of the evaluations.","[{""submissionId"":20000020514,""id"":""eacfd2ec1c014a7496ac3daff2b9d954"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]","[{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""},{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000020514

An EMS system was developed that provided variable but quantifiable levels of EMS, and measured torque. The dominant log of three male subjects was stimulated twice daily in a 3-d on/1-d off cycle during bedrest. The non-dominant leg of each subject acted as a control. A stimulator, using a 0.3 ms monophasic 60 Hz pulse waveform, activated muscle tissue for 4 s. The output waveform from the stimulator was sequenced to the Knee Extensors (KE), Knee Flex- ors (KF), Ankle Extensors (AE), and Ankle Flexors (AF), and caused three isometric contractions of each muscle group per minute. Subject tolerance determined EMS Intensity. Each muscle group received four 5-min bouts of EMS each session with a 10 -min rest between bouts. EMS and torque levels for each muscle action were recorded directly an a computer. Overall average EMS Intensity was 197, 197, 195, and 188 mA for the KE, KF, AF, and AE, respectively. Overall average torque development for these muscle groups was 70, 16, 12, and 27 Nm, respectively. EMS intensity doubled during the study, and average torque increased 2.5 times. Average maximum torque throughout a session reached 54% of maximal voluntary for the KE and 29% for the KF. Reductions in leg volume, muscle compartment size, cross-sectional area of slow and fast-twitch fibers, strength, and aerobic enzyme activities, and increased log compliance were attenuated in the legs which received EMS during bedrest. These results indicate that similar EMS levels induce different torques among different muscle groups and that repeated exposure to EMS increases tolerance and torque development. Longer orien- tation periods, therefore, may enhance its effectiveness. Our preliminary data suggest that the efficacy of EMS as an effective countermeasure for muscle atrophy and strength loss during long duration space travel warrants further investigation.","[{""submissionId"":19970022011,""publisher"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""id"":""4e4cc486ba514d4b8e22e49e206bdba4"",""publicationName"":""Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine"",""publicationDate"":""1989-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":19970022011,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""New Orleans, LA"",""id"":""2fcdd341a069404ca2e3ec6c5c8dcb57"",""startDate"":""1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NAS10-10285""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19970022011

O."",""Kuusela, Tom A."",""Cooke, William H."",""Ames, Jimey E.""]","When astronauts return to Earth and stand upright, their heart rates may speed inordinately, their blood pressures may fall, and some returning astronauts may even faint. Since physiological adjustments to standing are mediated importantly by pressure-regulating reflexes (baroreflexes), we studied involuntary (or autonomic) nerve and blood pressure responses of astronauts to four, 15-second periods of 15- and 30-mmHg straining (Valsalva'.~ maneuver). We measured the electrocardiogram, finger blood pressure, respiration, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity in four healthy male astronauts before and during the 16-day Neurolab Space Shuttle mission. We found that although microgravity provoked major autonomic changes, no astronaut experienced fainting symptoms after the mission. Blood pressure fell more during straining in space than on Earth (the average reduction of systolic pressure with 30-mmHg straining was 49 mmHg during and 27 mmHg before the mission). However, the increases of muscle sympathetic nerve activity that were triggered by straining were also larger in space than on Earth. As a result, the gain of the sympathetic baroreflex, taken as the total sympathetic nerve response divided by the maximum pressure reduction during straining, was the same in space as on Earth. In contrast, heart rate changes, which are mediated by changes of vagus nerve activity, were smaller in space. This and earlier research suggest that exposure to microgravity augments blood pressure and sympathetic adjustments to Valsalva straining and differentially reduces vagal, but not sympathetic baroreflex responsiveness. The changes that we documented can be explained economically as a consequence of the blood volume reduction that occurs in space.","[{""submissionId"":20030068220,""id"":""a873fe11edf24aa1b4e319647d9654b6"",""publicationName"":""The Neurolab Spacelab Mission: Neuroscience Research in Space: Results from the STS-90, Neurolab Spacelab Mission"",""publicationDate"":""2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAS2-19541"",""NAG2-48"",""UOIHL-56417""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20030068190,""title"":""The Neurolab Spacelab Mission: Neuroscience Research in Space: Results from the STS-90, Neurolab Spacelab Mission""},{""id"":20030068190,""title"":""The Neurolab Spacelab Mission: Neuroscience Research in Space: Results from the STS-90, Neurolab Spacelab Mission""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20030068220
20100015381,ABSTRACT,Treadmill Exercise Within LBNP as an Integrated Coutermeasure to Microgravity,"[""Lee, Stuart"",""Hargens, A. R."",""Schneider, S. M."",""Watenpaugh, D. E.""]","An integrated exercise countermeasure for microgravity is needed to protect multiple physiologic systems and save crew time. Such a countermeasure should protect orthostatic tolerance, upright ambulatory capability (including sprinting), aerobic capacity, muscle strength/endurance, and other physiologic parameters relevant to human performance. We developed a novel physiologic countermeasure, treadmill exercise within LBNP, for preventing cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning associated with prolonged bed rest and spaceflight. We evaluated 40 min of daily LBNP treadmill exercise by a battery of physiologic parameters relevant to maintaining exercise performance and health of both women and men during bed-rest (simulated microgravity) studies lasting from 5 to 60 days. For 30 day studies, we employed identical twins with one twin as the control and the other twin as the exerciser to improve comparative power. During the WISE 60-day HDT study, the treadmill exercise within LBNP was performed 3-4 days each week and resistive exercise was performed 2-3 days each week. Our treadmill within LBNP protocol maintained plasma volume and sprint speed (30 day HDT bed-rest studies of identical twins), orthostatic tolerance to a degree, upright exercise capacity, muscle strength and endurance, and some bone parameters during 30 day (twin studies) and 60 day (WISE-2005) bed-rest simulations of microgravity. When combining treadmill exercise within LBNP and resistive exercise (WISE), cardiac mass increased significantly in the exercise (EX) group during bed rest relative to controls (CON). Upright peak VO2, and knee extensor strength and endurance decreased significantly in CON subjects; but these parameters were preserved in the EX group. In the 60 day WISE study, each LBNP exercise session was followed immediately by 10 minutes of static LBNP, and the last such session occurred three days before the end of bed rest. Still, orthostatic tolerance was better maintained in the EX group than in the CON group. Therefore, these collective peer-reviewed results document that our treadmill exercise within LBNP countermeasure safely and efficiently protects multiple physiologic systems in women and men during bed-rest studies of up to 60 days.

20220015095,CONFERENCE_PAPER,The Effects of Space Flight and Microgravity Exposure on Female Astronaut Health and Performance,"[""Nicole Strock"",""Eric Rivas"",""Karina Marshall-Goebel""]","Over the past half century, our understanding of the physiological effects of space exploration and microgravity exposure have improved immensely. Microgravity causes incredible changes to the human body that increase risk of injury upon return to Earth and lunar/planetary egress scenarios. This is due to deconditioning of the cardiovascular and skeletal muscle systems that reduce aerobic capacity and muscular strength. With upcoming exploration class missions, such as NASA’s Artemis lunar exploration program which aims to send the first female astronaut to the lunar surface by 2030, as well as a long-term goal of Martian exploration, maintaining astronaut health during extended-duration space flight is critical for achieving mission objectives. However, our understanding of these physiological implications due to microgravity are based primarily on flight studies of male astronauts and 1g bed rest analog study participants, with few investigations focusing specifically on females. Innate physiologic differences in endocrine signaling and reproductive function impact sex-dependent responses to various health conditions, treatments, and environmental factors in nearly every system in the body. Therefore, to assume comparable alterations in females in response to microgravity exposure may be inappropriate and consequentially, could lead to lasting impacts on female astronaut health and impact mission success. Moreover, differences in sex hormones may also influence the regulation of cardiovascular control during egress activity after space flight-induced deconditioning and blood volume loss (i.e., risk for orthostatic intolerance). Other potential physiological systems and factors related to musculoskeletal health and aerobic capacity that warrant investigation with respect to microgravity include endocrine/reproductive function, vascular control, bone mineral density/microarchitecture, and soft-tissue health. The purpose of this investigation is two-fold: 1) to summarize the data available from space flight and simulated bed rest analog exposures to begin addressing these gaps in knowledge regarding impacts to female astronaut health, and 2) to describe differences in demographic health characteristics, injury prevalence, and aerobic capacity and muscular strength in NASA female and male astronauts. Female astronauts make up 50% of Artemis-specific astronaut corps and the extent to which microgravity exposure impacts female cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health, and whether these alterations are consistent with their male counterparts, is inconclusive. With the growing inclusion of female astronauts in the NASA space program and the increased duration of missions beyond low Earth orbit, a greater understanding of the sex-specific adaptation to space travel will help determine the development of appropriate countermeasures for minimizing risk and maintaining health of all astronauts.

A."",""Ellis, S."",""Bain, J."",""Sedlak, F."",""Slocum, G."",""Oganov, V.""]","The present findings on rat hindlimb muscles suggest that skeletal muscle weakness induced by prolonged spaceflight can result from a combination of muscle fiber atrophy, muscle fiber segmental necrosis, degeneration of motor nerve terminals and destruction of microcirculatory vessels. Damage was confined to the red adductor longus (AL) and soleus muscles. The midbelly region of the AL muscle had more segmental necrosis and edema than the ends. Macrophages and neutrophils were the major mononucleated cells infiltrating and phagocytosing the cellular debris. Toluidine blue-positive mast cells were significantly decreased in Flight AL muscles compared to controls; this indicated that degranulation of mast cells contributed to tissue edema. Increased ubiquitination of disrupted myofibrils may have promoted myofilament degradation. Overall, mitochondria content and SDH activity were normal, except for a decrease in the subsarcolemmal region. The myofibrillar ATPase activity shifted toward the fast type in the Flight AL muscles. Some of the pathological changes may have occurred or been exacerbated during the 2 day postflight period of readaptation to terrestrial gravity. While simple atrophy should be reversible by exercise, restoration of pathological changes depends upon complex processes of regeneration by stem cells. Initial signs of muscle and nerve fiber regeneration were detected. Even though regeneration proceeds on Earth, the space environment may inhibit repair and cause progressive irreversible deterioration during long term missions. Muscles obtained from Flight rats sacrificed immediately (within a few hours) after landing are needed to distinguish inflight changes from postflight readaptation.","[{""submissionId"":19900017147,""id"":""e8715fe2142549f79df43523b460858e"",""publicationName"":""NASA, Ames Research Center, The US Experiments Flown on the Soviet Biosatellite Cosmos 1887"",""publicationDate"":""1990-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19900017147

J."",""Stevens, B. R."",""Lieberman, S. A."",""Greenisen, M. C.""]","Because resistance exercise (REx) and bed-rest unloading (BRU) are associated with opposing adaptations, our purpose was to test the efficacy of REx against the effects of 14 days of BRU on the knee-extensor muscle group. Sixteen healthy men were randomly assigned to no exercise (NoEx; n = 8) or REx (n = 8). REx performed five sets of leg press exercise with 80-85% of one repetition maximum (1 RM) every other day during BRU. Muscle samples were removed from the vastus lateralis muscle by percutaneous needle biopsy. Myofiber distribution was determined immunohistochemically with three monoclonal antibodies against myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms (I, IIa, IIx). MHC distribution was further assessed by quantitative gel electrophoresis. Dynamic 1-RM leg press and unilateral maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) were determined. Maximal neural activation (root mean squared electromyogram) and rate of torque development (RTD) were measured during MVC. Reductions (P < 0.05) in type I (15%) and type II (17%) myofiber cross-sectional areas were found in NoEx but not in REx. Electrophoresis revealed no changes in MHC isoform distribution. The percentage of type IIx myofibers decreased (P < 0.05) in REx from 9 to 2% and did not change in NoEx. 1 RM was reduced (P < 0.05) by 9% in NoEx but was unchanged in REx.

Results indicate that REx prevented BRU-induced myofiber atrophy and also maintained training-specific strength. Unlike spaceflight, BRU did not induce shifts in myosin phenotype.

20000029458,OTHER,Bone Blood Flow During Simulated Microgravity: Physiological and Molecular Mechanisms,"[""Bloomfield, Susan A.""]","Blood flow to bone has been shown to affect bone mass and presumably bone strength. Preliminary data indicate that blood flow to the rat femur decreases after 14 days of simulated microgravity, using hindlimb suspension (HLS). If adult rats subjected to HLS are given dobutamine, a synthetic catecholamine which can cause peripheral vasodilation and increased blood flow, the loss of cortical bone area usually observed is prevented. Further, mechanisms exist at the molecular level to link changes in bone blood flow to changes in bone cell activity, particularly for vasoactive agents like nitric oxide (NO). The decreases in fluid shear stress created by fluid flow associated with the shifts of plasma volume during microgravity may result in alterations in expression of vasoactive agents such as NO, producing important functional effects on bone cells. The primary aim of this project is to characterize changes in 1) bone blood flow, 2) indices of bone mass, geometry, and strength, and 3) changes in gene expression for modulators of nitric oxide activity (e.g., nitric oxide synthase) and other candidate genes involved in signal transduction of mechanical loading after 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of HLS in the adult rat. Using a rat of at least 5 months of age avoids inadvertently studying effects of simulated microgravity on growing, rather than adult, bone. Utilizing the results of these studies, we will then define how altered blood flow contributes to changes in bone with simulated microgravity by administering a vasodilatory agent (which increases blood flow to tissues) during hindlimb suspension. In all studies, responses in the unloaded hindlimb bones (tibial shaft, femoral neck) will be compared with those in the weightbearing humeral shaft and the non-weightbearing calvarium (skull) from the same animal. Bone volumetric mineral density and geometry will be quantified by peripheral quantitative CT; structural and material properties of the long bones will be determined by 3-point bending (tibia, humerus) or compression (femoral neck) testing to failure. A unique aspect of these studies will be defining the time course of changes in gene expression in bone cell populations with unloading, accomplished with Northern blots, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. These studies have high relevance for concurrent protocols being proposed by investigators on NSBRI Cardiovascular and Muscle teams, with blood flow data available on a number of tissues other than bone. Further, dobutamine and other Beta-agonists have been tested as countermeasures for altered muscle and cardiovascular function. Results of the intervention tested in our studies have potential relevance for a number of systemic changes seen with prolonged spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":20000029458,""id"":""f325650d099b4fef9d98c706f40acc06"",""publicationName"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute"",""publicationDate"":""1999-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""},{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000029458

It is concluded that some significant changes were observed in the VM in rats exposed to weightlessness for 14 days. There is a loss in weight compared with the vivarium controls but not in comparison with synchronous and basal controls.

Twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: flight and ground-based control. Approximately 3 h after the landing, in situ contractile measurements were made on the soleus muscles of the flight animals. The control animals were studied 24 h later. The contractile measurements included force-velocity relationship, force-frequency relationship, and fatigability. Biochemical measurements focused on the myosin heavy chain (MHC) and myosin light chain profiles. Adenosinetriphosphatase histochemistry was performed to identify cross-sectional area of slow and fast muscle fibers and to determine the percent fiber type distribution. The force-velocity relationships of the flight muscles were altered such that maximal isometric tension P(sub o) was decreased by 24% and maximal shortening velocity was increased by 14% (P less than 0.05). The force-frequency relationship of the flight muscles was shifted to the right of the control muscles. At the end of the 2-min fatigue test, the flight muscles generated only 34% of P(sub o), whereas the control muscles generated 64% of P(sub o). The flight muscles exhibited de novo expression of the type IIx MHC isoform as well as a slight decrease in the slow type I and fast type IIa MHC isoforms. Histochemical analyses of flight muscles demonstrated a small increase in the percentage of fast type II fibers and a greater atrophy of the slow type I fibers. The results demonstrate that contractile properties of slow antigravity skeletal muscle are sensitive to the microgravity environment and that changes begin to occur within the 1st wk. These changes were at least, in part, associated with changes in the amount and type of contractile protein expressed.","[{""volume"":""76"",""submissionId"":19950030336,""issue"":""4"",""issn"":""8750-7587"",""id"":""689144aa76294194a7e18e836be0a4be"",""publicationName"":""Journal of Applied Physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1994-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG2-555""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19950030336
20230002457,PRESENTATION,The Effects of Space Flight and Microgravity Exposure on Female Astronaut Health and Performance,"[""Nicole Strock"",""Eric Rivas"",""Karina Marshall-Goebel""]","Over the past half century, our understanding of the physiological effects of space exploration and microgravity exposure have improved immensely. Microgravity causes incredible changes to the human body that increase risk of injury upon return to Earth and lunar/planetary egress scenarios. This is due to deconditioning of the cardiovascular and skeletal muscle systems that reduce aerobic capacity and muscular strength. With upcoming exploration class missions, such as NASA’s Artemis lunar exploration program which aims to send the first female astronaut to the lunar surface by 2030, as well as a long-term goal of Martian exploration, maintaining astronaut health during extended-duration space flight is critical for achieving mission objectives. However, our understanding of these physiological implications due to microgravity are based primarily on flight studies of male astronauts and 1g bed rest analog study participants, with few investigations focusing specifically on females. Innate physiologic differences in endocrine signaling and reproductive function impact sex-dependent responses to various health conditions, treatments, and environmental factors in nearly every system in the body. Therefore, to assume comparable alterations in females in response to microgravity exposure may be inappropriate and consequentially, could lead to lasting impacts on female astronaut health and impact mission success. Moreover, differences in sex hormones may also influence the regulation of cardiovascular control during egress activity after space flight-induced deconditioning and blood volume loss (i.e., risk for orthostatic intolerance). Other potential physiological systems and factors related to musculoskeletal health and aerobic capacity that warrant investigation with respect to microgravity include endocrine/reproductive function, vascular control, bone mineral density/microarchitecture, and soft-tissue health. The purpose of this investigation is two-fold: 1) to summarize the data available from space flight and simulated bed rest analog exposures to begin addressing these gaps in knowledge regarding impacts to female astronaut health, and 2) to describe differences in demographic health characteristics, injury prevalence, and aerobic capacity and muscular strength in NASA female and male astronauts. Female astronauts make up 50% of Artemis-specific astronaut corps and the extent to which microgravity exposure impacts female cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health, and whether these alterations are consistent with their male counterparts, is inconclusive. With the growing inclusion of female astronauts in the NASA space program and the increased duration of missions beyond low Earth orbit, a greater understanding of the sex-specific adaptation to space travel will help determine the development of appropriate countermeasures for minimizing risk and maintaining health of all astronauts.

20000020547,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Potential Mechanism Leading to Impaired Thermoregulation Following Microgravity Exposure,"[""Crandall, C. G."",""Etzel, R. A.""]","Prolonged exposure to microgravity or its analogues impairs thermoregulation in humans evidenced by higher internal temperatures following the exposure during a thermal challenge. Although the mechanism leading to this response has not been clearly delineated, we identified that prolonged head-down tilt (HDT) markedly impairs thermoregulatory reflex control of skin blood flow, as demonstrated by an increased internal temperature threshold for cutaneous vasodilation, and by a reduced slope of the relationship between the elevation in skin blood flow relative to the elevation in internal temperature. Recently, Fortney et al. identified similar responses in two individuals following 115 days of microgravity exposure. One possible mechanism leading to altered cutaneous vasodilation during a thermal challenge following actual or simulated microgravity exposure may be associated with baroreflex-mediated attenuation in the elevation of skin blood flow. During a heat stress the elevation in skin blood flow is accomplished through a combination of increased cutaneous vascular conductance and cardiac output, both of which result in central venous pressure (CVP) decreasing 2-6 mmHg. Reductions in CVP of this magnitude in normothermia decrease muscle blood flow and skin blood flow presumably through unloading the cardiopulmonary baroreceptors. It is unclear whether the reduction in CVP, and accompanying cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading, during passive heating buffers the elevation in skin blood flow. That is, would the elevation in skin blood flow be greater if CVP did not decrease, or decreased to a lesser extent during the heat stress? Conversely, if CVP decreased to a greater extend during a thermal challenge following a perturbation such as prolonged HDT, would the elevation in skin blood flow be attenuated during that thermal challenge? Given that prolonged HDT decreases plasma volume and central venous pressure, such a finding would provide a plausible hypothesis to explain why skin blood flow does not increase to the same extent during a heat stress following simulated or actual microgravity exposure. Thus, the purpose of this project was to identify whether cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading coincident with heat stress buffers the elevation in skin blood flow.","[{""submissionId"":20000020547,""id"":""24a71c00b10a4f718c113b910076433e"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG9-1033"",""NAGW-3582""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""},{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000020547

The studies involve the elimination of weight-bearing responsibility of lower-limb human musculature to simulate the unweighting effects of space travel in the absence of exercise. Reference is given to bedrest and unilateral lower-limb suspension, both of which provide data that demonstrate the decreased strength of the knee extensors of 20-25 percent. The response is related to the decrease in cross-sectional area of the knee extensors which is a direct indication of muscle-fiber atrophy. Most of the effects of unweighting are associated with extensor muscles in the lower limbs and not with postural muscles. Unweighting is concluded to cause significant adaptations in the human neuromuscular system that require further investigation.","[{""submissionId"":19920039164,""id"":""be0810291f284742a4f5c87f5de7794d"",""publicationDate"":""1991-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAS10-10285"",""NAS10-11624""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19920039164

J."",""Ploutz-Snyder, L.""]","The functional task test is a multi-disciplinary study investigating how space-flight induced changes to physiological systems impacts functional task performance. Impairment of neuromuscular function would be expected to negatively affect functional performance of crewmembers following exposure to microgravity. This presentation reports the results for muscle performance testing in crewmembers. Functional task performance will be presented in the abstract ""Functional Task Test 1: sensory motor adaptations associated with postflight alternations in astronaut functional task performance."" METHODS: Muscle performance measures were obtained in crewmembers before and after short-duration space flight aboard the Space Shuttle and long-duration International Space Station (ISS) missions. The battery of muscle performance tests included leg press and bench press measures of isometric force, isotonic power and total work. Knee extension was used for the measurement of central activation and maximal isometric force. Upper and lower body force steadiness control were measured on the bench press and knee extension machine, respectively. Tests were implemented 60 and 30 days before launch, on landing day (Shuttle crew only), and 6, 10 and 30 days after landing. Seven Space Shuttle crew and four ISS crew have completed the muscle performance testing to date. RESULTS: Preliminary results for Space Shuttle crew reveal significant reductions in the leg press performance metrics of maximal isometric force, power and total work on R+0 (p<0.05). Bench press total work was also significantly impaired, although maximal isometric force and power were not significantly affected. No changes were noted for measurements of central activation or force steadiness. Results for ISS crew were not analyzed due to the current small sample size. DISCUSSION: Significant reductions in lower body muscle performance metrics were observed in returning Shuttle crew and these adaptations are likely contributors to impaired functional tasks that are ambulatory in nature (See abstract Functional Task Test: 1). Interestingly, no significant changes in central activation capacity were detected. Therefore, impairments in muscle function in response to short-duration space flight are likely myocellular rather than neuromotor in nature.","[{""submissionId"":20110023264,""id"":""0f25b781e26441efb79bbcc1697f5cda"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110023264,""endDate"":""2012-02-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""91534634413f400c9fbb441341115e11"",""id"":""a6ea40eaafef44dc938b2adc5fdbc7a0""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""91534634413f400c9fbb441341115e11"",""startDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110023264

20100039646,ABSTRACT,Preliminary Results of the Effect of Microgravity on Seated Height,"[""Rajulu, Sudhakar"",""Young, Karen"",""Mesloh, Miranda""]","The new vehicle for future space travel to the International Space Station (ISS) and beyond will be highly dependent on the seat layout. A primary concern with the seat layout design of the new vehicle is the amount of seated height growth that occurs in space; this could cause a major accommodation issue. The design of the seats, seat layout, suit fit, and crew accommodation are all critically affected due to the increase in height that occurs in microgravity. The increase in height due to spinal elongation caused by the absence of gravity could lead to inadequate clearances that would have implications for the ability of crewmembers to return safely or to conduct nominal operations during the mission. This study was designed to reduce the risk of inadequate design of the vehicle, environment, tools, equipment, etc. (SHFE risk 2.3.1.1) and safely return crewmembers to earth from low-earth orbit travel, ISS, and beyond. In order to safely return the crewmembers, the design requirements must anticipate microgravity growth, elongation of the spine, bone and muscle loss, fluid shifts, etc. Thus, this study is to determine the amount of torso growth (spinal elongation) for a seated posture during Shuttle and ISS missions. Crewmembers seated heights were collected before, during, and after spaceflight to quantify the amount of growth that occurred as a result of microgravity. The changes in seated height will provide the designers with a design requirement which allows for change in spinal growth for a seated posture. Preliminary results have shown that , during flight, seated height increases by a range of approximately 2-6 percent compared to pre-launch seated height.","[{""submissionId"":20100039646,""id"":""be4afd19e7114f37a20552e03ec196b5"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20100039646,""endDate"":""2011-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics: Humans in Space Symposium"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""719e3687f5e64f98944cb2cb015cae46"",""startDate"":""2011-04-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100039646

It is shown that prolonged exposure to microgravity induced ultrastructural abnormalities and the atrophy of muscle and impaired muscle functioning (especially upon return to terrestrial gravity) and that ground-based models can be effectively used to study these changes. Results indicate that the incorporation of resistive exercise with a strong emphasis on the use of eccentric muscle action, in addition to concentric action, may provide a very effective countermeasure against muscle atrophy and dysfunction caused by long-duration exposures to microgravity.","[{""volume"":""34"",""submissionId"":19920056543,""issue"":""1, Fe"",""issn"":""0031-9376"",""id"":""7255da1dcba44a5090ece2e4a4a167ee"",""publicationName"":""Physiologist, Supplement"",""publicationDate"":""1991-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19920056543

M."",""Norcross, J."",""Goetchius, E."",""Feiveson, A.""]","NASA’s vision for future exploration missions depends on the ability to protect astronauts’ health and safety for performance of Extravehicular Activity (EVA), and to allow astronauts to safely egress from vehicles in a variety of landing scenarios (e.g. water landing upon return to Earth and undefined planetary/lunar landings). Prolonged exposure to spaceflight results in diminished tolerance to prolonged physical activity, decreased cardiac and sensorimotor function, and loss of bone mineral density, muscle mass, and muscle strength. For over 50 years exercise has been the primary countermeasure against these physiologic decrements during spaceflight, and while the resulting protection is adequate for ISS missions (i.e., Soyuz landing, microgravity EVAs), there is little information regarding time-course changes in muscle and aerobic performance. As spaceflight progresses towards longer exploration missions and vehicles with less robust exercise capabilities compared to ISS, countermeasures will need to be combined and optimized to protect crew health and performance across all organ systems over the course of exploration missions up to 3 years in duration. This will require a more detailed understanding of the dynamic effects of spaceflight on human performance. Thus, the focus of this study is quantifying decrements in physical performance over different mission durations, and to provide detailed information on the physiological rational for “why” and “when” observed changes in performance occur. The research proposed will temporally profile changes in astronauts’ cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle mass, strength, and endurance over spaceflight missions of 2 months, 6 months, and up to 1 year in duration. Additionally, an extrapolation model will provide predictions for changes associated with exploration missions 2-3 years in duration. To accomplish these objectives astronauts will be asked to participate in pre, in, post-flight measurement of muscle performance, muscle size, cardiorespiratory fitness and submaximal performance capabilities, as well as non-invasive assessment of cerebral and muscle oxygenation and perfusion (Table 1). Additionally, ambulatory and in-flight exercise, nutrition, and sleep will be monitored using a variety of commercial technologies and in-flight assessment tools. Significance: Our detailed testing protocol will provide valuable information for describing how and when spaceflight-induced muscle and aerobic based adaptations occur over the course of spaceflight missions up to and beyond 1 year. This information will be vital in the assessment as to whether humans can be physically ready for deep space exploration such as Mars missions with current technology, or if additional mitigation strategies are necessary.

E.""]","Endothelial nitric oxide contributes to the vascular hyporesponsiveness to norepinephrine (NE) observed in carotid arteries from rats exposed to simulated microgravity. The goal of the present study was to determine whether a cyclooxygenase product of arachidonic acid also influences vascular responsiveness in this setting. Microgravity was simulated in rats by hindlimb unweighting (HU). After 20 days of HU, carotid arteries were isolated from control and HU-treated rats, and vascular rings were mounted in tissue baths for the measurement of isometric contraction. Two cyclooxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin and ibuprofen, and the selective thromboxane A(2) prostanoid-receptor antagonist, SQ-29548, had no effect on the contraction to NE in control vessels but markedly reduced contraction to NE in HU vessels. When the endothelium was removed, indomethacin no longer had any effect on the NE-induced contraction in HU vessels. In endothelium-intact vessels in the presence of indomethacin, the addition of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(G)-L-nitro-arginine methyl ester, to the medium bathing HU vessels increased the contraction to NE to the level of that of the control vessels. These results indicate that HU treatment induced two endothelial changes in carotid artery that opposed each other. Nitric oxide activity was increased and was responsible for the vascular hyporesponsiveness to NE. The activity of a vasoconstrictor prostaglandin was also increased, and attenuated the vasodilating effect of nitric oxide.","[{""volume"":""91"",""submissionId"":20040112364,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""8750-7587"",""id"":""43d552c1f9b648a09950fa778572d4c7"",""publicationName"":""Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. :  1985)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""5-F31 HL-09725-03""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040112364

For the microgravity study, rats were subdivided into four groups: preflight (PF, n = 12); flight (Fl, n = 7); flight cage simulation (Sim, n = 6), and vivarium control (Viv, n = 7). Animals in the Fl group were exposed to 7 days of microgravity during the Spacelab 3 mission. Animals in the hindlimb-unloading study were subdivided into three groups: control (Con, n = 20), 7-day hindlimb-unloaded (7HU, n = 10), and 28-day hindlimb-unloaded (28HU, n = 19). Heart mass was unchanged in adult animals exposed to 7 days of actual microgravity (PF 1.33 +/- 0.03 g; Fl 1.32 +/- 0.02 g; Sim 1.28 +/- 0.04 g; Viv 1.35 +/- 0.04 g). Similarly, heart mass was unaltered with hindlimb unloading (Con 1.40 +/- 0.04 g; 7HU 1.35 +/- 0.06 g; 28HU 1.42 +/- 0.03 g). Hindlimb unloading also had no effect on the peak rate of rise in left ventricular pressure, an estimate of myocardial contractility (Con 8,055 +/- 385 mmHg/s; 28HU 8,545 +/- 755 mmHg/s).

Using evidence-based knowledge as a background for identified risks to astronaut health and performance, NASA had identified gaps in knowledge to address those risks. Ongoing and proposed tasks were presented to address the gaps. The charge to the Bone and Muscle Risk SRP was to review the gaps, evaluate whether the tasks addressed these gaps and to make recommendations to NASA s HRP Science Management Office regarding the Panel's review. The Bone and Muscle Risk SRP consisted of scientists who are experts in muscle, bone, or both and could evaluate the existing evidence with sufficient knowledge of the potential effects of long duration exposure to microgravity. More important, although expertise in basic science is important, the SRP was requested to evaluate the practicality of the proposed efforts in light of the realistic demands placed on the HRP. In short, all tasks presented in the Integrated Research Plan (IRP) should address specific questions related to the challenges faced by the astronauts as a result of prolonged exposure to microgravity. All tasks proposed to fill the gaps in knowledge should provide applied, translational data necessary to answer the specific questions. Several presentations were made to the SRP during the site visit and the SRP spent sufficient time to address the panel charge, either as a group or in separate sessions for the Bone and Muscle Risk subgroups. The SRP made a final debriefing to the HRP Program Scientist, Dr. John B. Charles, on October 6, 2009. Taking the evidence and identified risks as givens, the SRP concluded that 1) integration of information should lead to a more comprehensive approach to identifying the gaps, 2) not all tasks addressed the gaps as stated in the IRP, 3) better access should be given to the SRP to existing data to include in its review, and 4) there were some missing gaps and tasks. As a result the SRP recommended 1) combining certain gaps, which in some cases were addressed with identical tasks, 2) additional gaps and tasks to address some of the gaps, 3) deleting some gaps and tasks to better focus the efforts of NASA s HRP in prioritizing their efforts, and 4) prioritizing gaps to address significant issues needing resolution in the short term while maintaining an awareness of long-term goals. The SRP commended the efforts by the HHC Element to integrate knowledge gaps and design tasks to address the higher order questions.

G."",""Eke, Chika"",""Werner, C."",""Nelson, E. S."",""Mulugeta, L."",""Feola, A."",""Raykin, J."",""Samuels, B."",""Ethier, C. R.""]","Space flight impacts human physiology in many ways, the most immediate being the marked cephalad (headward) shift of fluid upon introduction into the microgravity environment. This physiological response to microgravity points to the redistribution of blood and interstitial fluid as a major factor in the loss of venous tone and reduction in heart muscle efficiency which impact astronaut performance. In addition, researchers have hypothesized that a reduction in astronaut visual acuity, part of the Visual Impairment and Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome, is associated with this redistribution of fluid. VIIP arises within several months of beginning space flight and includes a variety of ophthalmic changes including posterior globe flattening, distension of the optic nerve sheath, and kinking of the optic nerve. We utilize a suite of lumped parameter models to simulate microgravity-induced fluid redistribution in the cardiovascular, central nervous and ocular systems to provide initial and boundary data to a 3D finite element simulation of ocular biomechanics in VIIP. Specifically, the lumped parameter cardiovascular model acts as the primary means of establishing how microgravity, and the associated lack of hydrostatic gradient, impacts fluid redistribution. The cardiovascular model consists of 16 compartments, including three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments, three cranial blood compartments, and 10 thoracic and lower limb blood compartments. To assess the models capability to address variations in physiological parameters, we completed a formal uncertainty and sensitivity analysis that evaluated the relative importance of 42 input parameters required in the model on relative compartment flows and compartment pressures. Utilizing the model in a pulsatile flow configuration, the sensitivity analysis identified the ten parameters that most influenced each compartment pressure. Generally, each compartment responded appropriately to parameter variations associated with itself and adjacent compartments. However, several unexpected interactions between components, such as between the choroid plexus and the lower capillaries, were found, and are due to simplifications in the formulation of the model. The analysis illustrates that highly influential parameters and those that have unique influences within the model formulation must be tightly controlled for successful model application.","[{""submissionId"":20160012467,""id"":""e95ae48698a24359998a6e5c647cc3bb"",""publicationDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160012467,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""942510450978467e8859a4cddae51639""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160012467,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""5e263e09d52345b492a05638c1dcf696"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""933e4fe9186646b79ef19d6bc4c96ed2"",""id"":""e0403f3423534deeb35736c49d4533f8""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst.

20220009987,POSTER,The Effects of Spaceflight and Microgravity Exposure on Female Astronaut Health and Performance ,"[""Nicole Christine Strock"",""Eric Rivas"",""Karina J Marshall-bowman""]","Over the past half century, our understanding of the physiological effects of space exploration and microgravity exposure have improved immensely. Microgravity causes incredible changes to the human body that increase risk of injury upon return to Earth and lunar/planetary egress scenarios. This is due to deconditioning of the cardiovascular and skeletal muscle systems that reduce aerobic capacity and muscular strength. With upcoming exploration class missions, such as NASA’s Artemis lunar exploration program which aims to send the first female astronaut to the lunar surface by 2030, as well as a long-term goal of Martian exploration, maintaining astronaut health during extended-duration space flight is critical for achieving mission objectives. However, our understanding of these physiological implications due to microgravity are based primarily on flight studies of male astronauts and 1g bedrest analog study participants, with few investigations focusing specifically on females. Innate physiologic differences in endocrine signaling and reproductive function impact sex-dependent responses to various health conditions, treatments, and environmental factors in nearly every system in the body. Therefore, to assume comparable alterations in females in response to microgravity exposure may be inappropriate and consequentially, could lead to lasting impacts on female astronaut health and impact mission success. Moreover, differences in sex hormones may also influence the regulation of cardiovascular control during egress activity after space flight-induced deconditioning and blood volume loss (i.e., risk for orthostatic intolerance). Other potential physiological systems and factors related to musculoskeletal health and aerobic capacity that warrant investigation with respect to microgravity include endocrine/reproductive function, vascular control, bone mineral density/microarchitecture, and soft-tissue health. The purpose of this investigation is two-fold: 1) to summarize the data available from space flight and simulated bedrest analog exposures to begin addressing these gaps in knowledge regarding impacts to female astronaut health, and 2) to describe differences in demographic health characteristics, injury prevalence, and aerobic capacity and muscular strength in NASA female and male astronauts. Female astronauts make up 50% of Artemis-specific astronaut corps and the extent to which microgravity exposure impacts female cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health, and whether these alterations are consistent with their male counterparts, is inconclusive. With the growing inclusion of female astronauts in the NASA space program and the increased duration of missions beyond low Earth orbit, a greater understanding of the sex-specific adaptation to space travel will help determine the development of appropriate countermeasures for minimizing risk and maintaining health of all astronauts.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20220009987,""endDate"":""2023-03-11T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""Reston, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""8bea26d86d2b45218df3902cbed21ba9"",""id"":""e9994f0a663042908a4f3a521313218c""},{""organizationId"":""8af3236884f245a5bac7fc9648e4475a"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Prognostics and Health Management Society"",""location"":""Nashville, TN""}},""meetingId"":""8bea26d86d2b45218df3902cbed21ba9"",""id"":""c638216919064075b403e5379e599d02""}],""name"":""IEEE Aerospace Conference"",""location"":""Big Sky, Montana"",""id"":""8bea26d86d2b45218df3902cbed21ba9"",""url"":""https://aeroconf.org/"",""startDate"":""2023-03-04T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220009987
20190033190,PRESENTATION,Circulating miRNA Signature Predicts Health Risks Associated with Radiation and Microgravity,"[""Beheshti, Afshin""]","The many known health risks currently associated with space travel include increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, central nervous system related diseases, muscle degeneration, and changes with host-gut microbiome interactions that can have profound impact with these and other health risks. The majority of the risk from space travel stem of the two components of the space environment which are microgravity and radiation. From our earlier work (Beheshti et al, PLOS One, 2018), we predicted that there is a systemic component of the host that causes general increased health risks due to spaceflight driven by a circulating microRNA (miRNA) signature consisting of 13 miRNAs that directly regulates both p53 and TGF1. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules with a negative and post-transcriptional regulation on gene expression) are increasingly recognized as major systemic regulators of responses to stressors, including microgravity, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. In addition, due to the size and stability of miRNAs, it is known that miRNAs can circulate throughout the body and have been found in the majority of the bodily fluids including blood, urine, saliva, and tears. Here, we start to dissect the actual impact of this miRNA signature on both the radiation and microgravity components and prove that this miRNA signature actually exists in the circulation of a host. To achieve this, we obtained multiple tissues including, serum, liver, and spleen and utilizing droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), we start to show how this circulating miRNA signature impacts which component of the spaceflight. The tissue was obtained from experiments performed on C57BL/6 male mice (N=10 for each condition) that were hindlimb unloaded (HU) to simulated microgravity, irradiated with 2Gy gamma (IR), HU plus IR, and control mice under normal conditions. It was shown that these miRNAs were present in the serum as predicted by the in silico prediction from our earlier predictions. The HU vs Controls show significant increases of the predicted miRNAs in the serum for more than half of the miRNA signature, with remaining miRNAs increasing comparing to the controls close to statistical significance. IR vs control mice showed increases for the miRNAs, but not has pronounced as the HU conditions. Finally, the combination of the HU+IR vs controls showed increases for the majority of the miRNA signature. The data indicates that the miRNA signature originally predicted through in silico methods is mainly associated with the microgravity component and is circulating throughout the host resulting in a systemic impact of the miRNAs on the host. These miRNAs are shown in the literature to potentially increase health risks associated with several diseases. In addition, we have begun testing the potential of utilizing antagonists to this miRNA signature to act as a potential countermeasure to mitigate radiation impact on the organism. This work demonstrates for the first time the potential of a minimally invasive novel biomarker and countermeasure that can be used to mitigate both radiation and microgravity effects.

19960053141,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Microgravity Flight - Accommodating Non-Human Primates,"[""Dalton, Bonnie P."",""Searby, Nancy"",""Ostrach, Louis""]","Spacelab Life Sciences-3 (SLS-3) was scheduled to be the first United States man-tended microgravity flight containing Rhesus monkeys. The goal of this flight as in the five untended Russian COSMOS Bion flights and an earlier American Biosatellite flight, was to understand the biomedical and biological effects of a microgravity environment using the non-human primate as human surrogate. The SLS-3/Rhesus Project and COSMOS Primate-BIOS flights all utilized the rhesus monkey Macaca mulatta. The ultimate objective of all flights with an animal surrogate has been to evaluate and understand biological mechanisms at both the system and cellular level, thus enabling rational effective countermeasures for future long duration human activity under microgravity conditions and enabling technical application to correction of common human physiological problems within earth's gravity, e.g., muscle strength and reloading, osteoporosis, immune deficiency diseases. Hardware developed for the SLS-3/Rhesus Project was the result of a joint effort with the French Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) extending over the last decade. The flight hardware design and development required implementation of sufficient automation to insure flight crew and animal bio-isolation and maintenance with minimal impact to crew activities. A variety of hardware of varying functional capabilities was developed to support the scientific objectives of the original 22 combined French and American experiments, along with 5 Russian co-investigations, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, and behavioral studies. Unique elements of the Rhesus Research Facility (RRF) included separation of waste for daily delivery of urine and fecal samples for metabolic studies and a psychomotor test system for behavioral studies along with monitored food measurement. As in untended flights, telemetry measurements would allow monitoring of thermoregulation, muscular, and cardiac responses to weightlessness. In contrast, the five completed Cosmos/Bion flights, lacked the metabolic samples and behavioral task monitoring, but did facilitate studies of the neurovestibular system during several of the flights. The RRF accommodated two adult 8-11 kg rhesus monkeys, while the Russian experiments and hardware were configured for a younger animal in the 44 kg range. Both the American and Russian hardware maintained a controlled environmental system, specifically temperature, humidity, a timed lighting cycle, and had means for providing food and fluids to the animal(s). Crew availability during a Shuttle mission was to be an optimal condition for retrieval and refrigeration of the animal urine samples along with a manual calcein injection which could lead to greater understanding of bone calcium incorporation.

19970003368,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Microgravity Flight: Accommodating Non-Human Primates,"[""Dalton, Bonnie P."",""Searby, Nancy"",""Ostrach, Louis""]","Spacelab Life Sciences-3 (SLS-3) was scheduled to be the first United States man-tended microgravity flight containing Rhesus monkeys. The goal of this flight as in the five untended Russian COSMOS Bion flights and an earlier American Biosatellite flight, was to understand the biomedical and biological effects of a microgravity environment using the non-human primate as human surrogate. The SLS-3/Rhesus Project and COSMOS Primate-BIOS flights all utilized the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta. The ultimate objective of all flights with an animal surrogate has been to evaluate and understand biological mechanisms at both the system and cellular level, thus enabling rational effective countermeasures for future long duration human activity under microgravity conditions and enabling technical application to correction of common human physiological problems within earth's gravity, e.g., muscle strength and reloading, osteoporosis, immune deficiency diseases. Hardware developed for the SLS-3/Rhesus Project was the result of a joint effort with the French Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) extending over the last decade. The flight hardware design and development required implementation of sufficient automation to insure flight crew and animal bio-isolation and maintenance with minimal impact to crew activities. A variety of hardware of varying functional capabilities was developed to support the scientific objectives of the original 22 combined French and American experiments, along with 5 Russian co-investigations, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, and behavioral studies. Unique elements of the Rhesus Research Facility (RRF) included separation of waste for daily delivery of urine and fecal samples for metabolic studies and a psychomotor test system for behavioral studies along with monitored food measurement. As in untended flights, telemetry measurements would allow monitoring of thermoregulation, muscular, and cardiac responses to weightlessness. In contrast, the five completed Cosmos/Bion flights, lacked the metabolic samples and behavioral task monitoring, but did facilitate studies of the neurovestibular system during several of the flights. The RRF accommodated two adult 8-11 kg rhesus monkeys, while the Russian experiments and hardware were configured for a younger animal in the 44 kg range. Both the American and Russian hardware maintained a controlled environmental system, specifically temperature, humidity, a timed lighting cycle, and had means for providing food and fluids to the animal(s). Crew availability during a Shuttle mission was to be an optimal condition for retrieval and refrigeration of the animal urine samples along with a manual calcein injection which could lead to greater understanding of bone calcium incorporation. A special portable bioisolation glove box was under development to support this aspect of the experiment profile along with the capability of any contingency human intervention. As a result of recent U.S./Russian negotiations, funding for Space Station, and a series of other events, the SLS-3 mission was cancelled and applicable Rhesus Project experiments incorporated into the Russian Bion 11 and 12 missions.

R.""]","Motor function is altered by microgravity, but little detail is available as to what these changes are and how changes in the individual components of the sensorimotor system affect the control of movement. Further, there is little information on whether the changes in motor performance reflect immediate or chronic adaptations to changing gravitational environments. To determine the effects of microgravity on the neural control properties of selected motor pools, four male astronauts from the NASA STS-78 mission performed motor tasks requiring the maintenance of either ankle dorsiflexor or plantarflexor torque. Torques of 10 or 50% of a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) were requested of the subjects during 10 degrees peak-to-peak sinusoidal movements at 0.5 Hz. When 10% MVC of the plantarflexors was requested, the actual torques generated in-flight were similar to pre-flight values. Post-flight torques were higher than pre- and in-flight torques. The actual torques when 50% MVC was requested were higher in- and post-flight than pre-flight. Soleus (Sol) electromyographic (EMG) amplitudes during plantarflexion were higher in-flight than pre- or post-flight for both the 10 and 50% MVC tasks. No differences in medial gastrocnemius (MG) EMG amplitudes were observed for either the 10 or 50% MVC tasks. The EMG amplitudes of the tibialis anterior (TA), an antagonist to plantarflexion, were higher in- and post-flight than pre-flight for the 50% MVC task. During the dorsiflexion tasks, the torques generated in both the 10 and 50% MVC tasks did not differ pre-, in- and post-flight. TA EMG amplitudes were significantly higher in- than pre-flight for both the 10 or 50% MVC tasks, and remained elevated post-flight for the 50% MVC test. Both the Sol and MG EMG amplitudes were significantly higher in-flight than either pre- or post-flight for both the 10 and 50% MVC tests. These data suggest that the most consistent response to space flight was an elevation in the level of contractions of agonists and antagonists when attempting to maintain constant torques at a given level of MVC. Also, the chronic levels of EMG activity in selected ankle flexor and extensor muscles during space flight and during routine activities on Earth were recorded. Compared with pre- and post-flight values, there was a marked increase in the total EMG activity of the TA and the Sol and no change in the MG EMG activity in-flight. These data indicate that space flight, as occurs on shuttle missions, is a model of elevated activation of both flexor and extensor muscles, probably reflecting the effects of programmed work schedules in flight rather than a direct effect of microgravity.","[{""volume"":""204"",""submissionId"":20040088746,""issue"":""Pt 18"",""issn"":""0022-0949"",""id"":""9d153658fd914933ad5596e9b2e146f1"",""publicationName"":""The Journal of experimental biology"",""publicationDate"":""2001-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088746

We wanted to determine lower-extremity response to high-impact jumping exercises in true and simulated microgravity and establish if 1-G force magnitudes can be achieved in a weightless environment. METHODS: Jumping experiments were performed in a ground-based zero-gravity simulator (ZGS) in 1 G, and during parabolic flight with a gravity-replacement system. There were 12 subjects who participated in the study, with 4 subjects common to both conditions. Force, loading rates, jump height, and kinematics were analyzed during jumps with three distinct landings: two-footed toe-heel, one-footed toe-heel, and flat-footed. Gravity replacement loads of 45%, 60%, 75%, and 100% bodyweight were used in the ZGS; because of time constraints, these loads were limited to 60% and 75% bodyweight in parabolic flight. RESULTS: Average peak ground-reaction forces during landing ranged between 1902+/-607 and 2631+/-663 N in the ZGS and between 1683+/-807 and 2683+/-1174 N in the KC-135. No significant differences were found between the simulated and true microgravity conditions, but neither condition achieved the magnitudes found in 1 G. CONCLUSION: Data support the hypothesis that jumping exercises can impart high-impact forces during weightlessness and that the custom-designed ZGS will replicate what is experienced in true microgravity.","[{""volume"":""76"",""submissionId"":20050206862,""issue"":""5"",""issn"":""0095-6562"",""id"":""8d9142e4c8574d0aadc3a9cca7b09286"",""publicationName"":""Aviation, space, and environmental medicine"",""publicationDate"":""2005-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG5-4086""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050206862

Baroreceptor reflexes can modulate both pulmonary resistance and capacitance function and thus cardiac output. We hypothesized, therefore, that pulmonary vasoreactivity is impaired in the hindlimb-unweighted (HLU) rat model of microgravity. Pulmonary artery (PA) contractile responses to phenylephrine (PE) and U-46619 (U4) were significantly decreased in the PAs from HLU vs. control (C) animals. N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10(-5) M) enhanced the contractile responses in the PA rings from both C and HLU animals and completely abolished the differential responses to PE and U4 in HLU vs. C animals. Vasorelaxant responses to ACh were significantly enhanced in PA rings from HLU rats compared with C. Moreover, vasorelaxant responses to sodium nitroprusside were also significantly enhanced. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and soluble guanlyl cyclase expression were significantly enhanced in PA and lung tissue from HLU rats. In marked contrast, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase was unchanged in lung tissue. These data support the hypothesis that vascular contractile responsiveness is attenuated in PAs from HLU rats and that this hyporesponsiveness is due at least in part to increased nitric oxide synthase activity resulting from enhanced eNOS expression. These findings may have important implications for blood volume distribution and attenuated stroke volume responses to orthostatic stress after microgravity exposure.","[{""volume"":""92"",""submissionId"":20040088603,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""8750-7587"",""id"":""05a6f94affe346faac755654ca66b2c7"",""publicationName"":""Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. :  1985)"",""publicationDate"":""2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088603

On the basis of observations of fixed tissue, it was evident that some rats had testicular abnormalities unassociated with treatment and probably existing when they were assigned randomly to the four treatment groups. Considering rats without preexisting abnormalities, diameter of seminiferous tubules and numbers of germ cells per tubule cross section were lower (P less than 0.05) in flight than in simulated-launch or vivarium rats. However, ratios of germ cells to each other or to Sertoli cells and number of homogenization-resistant spermatids did not differ from values for simulated-launch or vivarium controls. Expression of testis-specific gene products was not greatly altered by flight. Furthermore, there was no evidence for production of stress-inducible transcripts of the hsp7O or hsp9O genes. Concentration of receptors for rat luteinizing hormone in testicular tissue and surface density of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in Leydig cells were similar in flight and simulated-launch rats. However, concentrations of testosterone in testicular tissue or peripheral blood plasma were reduced (P less than 0.05) in flight rats to less than 20% of values for simulated-launch or vivarium controls. Thus spermatogenesis was essentially normal in flight rats, but production of testosterone was severely depressed. Exposure to microgravity for more than 2 wk might result in additional changes. Sequelae of reduced androgen production associated with microgravity on turnover of muscle and bone should be considered.","[{""submissionId"":19980002822,""issn"":""0161-7567"",""publisher"":""American Physiological Society"",""id"":""e8eb4d932067460297e98559bffdc19c"",""publicationDate"":""1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NGT-50315"",""NAG2-613"",""NAG2-612"",""NAGw-1579"",""NCC2-12"",""NIH-G12-RR-03059-01A1"",""NAG2-597"",""NCC2-455""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19980002822

D.""]","Space flight-induced muscle atrophy, particularly in the postural and locomotorymuscles, may impair task performance during long-duration space missions and planetary exploration. High intensity free weight (FW) resistive exercise training has been shown to prevent atrophy during bed rest, a space flight analog. NASA developed the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) to simulate the characteristics of FW exercise (i.e. constant mass, inertial force) and to be used as a countermeasure during International Space Station (ISS) missions. PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of ARED and FW training to induce hypertrophy in specific muscle groups in ambulatory subjects prior to deploying ARED on the ISS. METHODS: Twenty untrained subjects were assigned to either the ARED (8 males, 3 females) or FW (6 males, 3 females) group and participated in a periodizedtraining protocol consisting of squat (SQ), heel raise (HR), and deadlift(DL) exercises 3 d wk-1 for 16 wks. SQ, HR, and DL muscle strength (1RM) was measured before, after 8 wks, and after 16 wks of training to prescribe exercise and measure strength changes. Muscle volume of the vastigroup (V), hamstring group (H), hip adductor group (ADD), medial gastrocnemius(MG), lateral gastrocnemius(LG), and deep posterior muscles including soleus(DP) was measured using MRI pre-and post-training. Consecutive cross-sectional images (8 mm slices with a 2 mm gap) were analyzed and summed. Anatomical references insured that the same muscle sections were analyzed pre-and post-training. Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs (p<0.05) were used to test for differences in muscle strength and volume between training devices. RESULTS: SQ, HR, and DL 1RM increased in both FW (SQ: 49+/-6%, HR: 12+/-2%, DL: 23+/-4%) and ARED (SQ: 31+/-4%, HR: 18+/-2%, DL: 23+/-3%) groups. Both groups increased muscle volume in the V (FW: 13+/-2%, ARED: 10+/-2%), H (FW: 3+/-1%, ARED: 3+/-1 %), ADD (FW: 15=/-2%, ARED: 10+/-1%), LG (FW: 7+/-2%, ARED: 4+/-1%), MG (FW: 7+/-2%, ARED: 5+/-2%), and DP (FW: 2+/-1%; ARED: 2+/-1%) after training. There were no between group differences in muscle strength or volume. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in muscle volume and strength following ARED training is not different than FW training. With the training effects similar to FW and a 600 lb load capacity, ARED likely will protect against muscle atrophy in microgravity.","[{""submissionId"":20090020693,""id"":""c6bc76a9d5634be4af1149d79db77c67"",""publicationDate"":""2009-05-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20090020693,""endDate"":""2009-05-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""ACSM 56th Annual Meeting"",""location"":""Seattle, WA"",""id"":""c3622326918e41b89a0dc2e27b50de82"",""startDate"":""2009-05-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090020693

For long-term exposure to space it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms for altered physiological functions. Fundamental occurrences in cell biology which are likely to depend on gravity include cytoskeletal dynamics, chromatin and centrosome cycling, and ion immobilization. These events can be studied during fertilization and embryogenesis within invertebrate systems. We have chosen the sea urchin system to study the effects of microgravity on cytoskeletal processes and calcium metabolism during fertilization, cell division, development, and embryogenesis. Experiments during an aircraft parabolic flight (KC-135) demonstrated: (1) the viability of sea urchin eggs prior to fertilization, (2) the suitability of our specimen containment system, (3) the feasibility of fertilization in a reduced gravity environment (which was achieved during 25 seconds of reduced gravity under parabolic flight conditions). Two newly developed pieces of spaceflight hardware made further investigations possible on a spaceflight (STS-77); (1) the Aquatic Research Facility (ARF), and (2) the Fertilization Syringe Unit (FSU). The Canadian Space Agency developed ARF to conduct aquatic spaceflight experiments requiring controlled conditions of temperature, humidity, illumination, and fixation at predetermined time points. It contained a control centrifuge which simulated the 1 g environment of earth during spaceflight. The FSU was developed at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) by the Bionetics Corporation specifically to enable the crew to perform sea urchin fertilization operations in space.","[{""submissionId"":19990053336,""id"":""d15dab06a5e849b0b6b23d39dd9bb3ce"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG10-224"",""NAG10-183""]",undefined,"[""Materials Processing""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19990053336

Adult male Fisher rats (n=12) were aboard flight STS-57 and exposed to 10 days of microgravity and adult ovariectomized female Spraque-Dawley rats (n=12) were aboard flight STS-62 for 14 days. Soleus muscles were bilaterally removed from the flight and control animals and frozen for subsequent analyses. Muscle wet weights, fiber types (I, IC, IIC, and IIA), cross-sectional area, and MHC content were determined. Although a significant difference was found between the soleus wet weights of the two ground-based control groups, they were similar with regard to MHC content (ca 90% MHCI and ca 10% MHCIIa) and fiber type composition. Unloading of the muscles caused slow-to-fast transformations which included a decrease in the percentage of type I fibers and MHCI, an increase in fibers classified as type IC, and the expression of two fast myosin heavy chains not found in the control rat soleus muscles (MHCIId and MHCIIb). Although the amount of atrophy (ca 26%) and the extent of slow-to-fast transformation (decrease in the percentage of MHCI from 90% to 82.5%) in the soleus muscles were similar between the two spaceflights, the percentages of the fast MHCs differed. After 14 days of spaceflight, the percentage of MHCIIa was significantly lower and the percentages of MHCIId and MHCIIb were significantly higher than the corresponding MHC content of the soleus muscles from the 10-day animals. Indeed, MHCIId became the predominant fast MHC after 14 days in space.

Prolonged exposure to spaceflight can diminish tolerance for physical activity, decrease cardiovascular and sensorimotor function, cause loss of bone mineral density, as well as reduced muscle mass and strength. Although exercise can mitigate these spaceflight-induced physiological decrements, little is known regarding the time-course of changes in muscle and aerobic performance during spaceflight. Furthermore, these exercise countermeasures are not fully protective. For example, maximal aerobic capacity (VO2pk), lower body muscle cross-sectional area, and strength decrease by about 10% to 15% after short- (≈14 days) and long-duration (≈6 months) missions on the International Space Station (ISS). Future space missions longer in duration and further from Earth will employ exploration vehicles that will have exercise hardware with less robust and more constrained exercise capabilities than of those available on the ISS. Thus, countermeasures will need to be optimized to protect crew health and performance on exploration-class missions lasting up to 3 years. This requires a more detailed understanding of the dynamic effects of spaceflight on human health and performance, the ability of exercise to protect against this deconditioning, and the interaction of exercise with interrelated factors like nutrition, sleep, and environmental conditions. 

Methods: We will use standardized research and medical testing protocols previously validated in 1g and microgravity to quantify the time course and the inter-individual variability of changes in physical performance, including cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength and endurance, before, during, and after spaceflight missions lasting 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Additionally, we will use an extrapolation model to predict changes associated with multi-year exploration missions. Additionally, we will monitor in-flight exercise, nutrition, and sleep using in-flight assessment tools. 

Significance: Our testing protocols will provide valuable information for determining time course of change and the interindividual variability of spaceflight-induced deconditioning of aerobic capacity and muscle strength and endurance over the course of spaceflight missions up to and beyond 1 year. This information will be vital to assess whether humans can be physically ready for deep space exploration, such as on a mission to Mars, using current technology, or if additional mitigation strategies are necessary.

In the present study, hypophysectomized rats were in HS for 7 days, and the effects of recombinant human growth hormone (GH), exercise (Ex), or GH+Ex on the weights, protein concentrations, and fiber cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of hindlimb muscles were determined. The weights of four extensor muscles, i.e., the soleus (Sol), medial (MG) and lateral (LG) gastrocnemius, and plantaris (Plt), and one adductor, i.e., the adductor longus (AL), were decreased by 10-22% after HS. Fiber CSAs were decreased by 34% in the Sol and by 1 17% in the MG after HS. In contrast, two flexors, i.e., the tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL), did not atrophy. In HS rats, GH treatment alone maintained the weights of the fast extensors (MG, LG, Plt) and flexors (TA, EDL) at or above those of control rats. This effect was not observed in the slow extensor (Sol) or AL. Exercise had no significant effect on the weight of any muscle in HS rats. A combination of GH and Ex treatments yielded a significant increase in the weights of the fast extensors and in the CSA of both fast and slow fibers of the MG and significantly increased Sol weight and CSA of the slow fibers of the Sol. The AL was not responsive to either GH or Ex treatments. Protein concentrations of the Sol and MG were higher only in the Sol of Ex and GH+Ex rats. These results suggest that while GH treatment or intermittent high intensity exercise alone have a minimal effect in maintaining the mass of unloaded muscle, there is a strong interactive effect of these two treatments.","[{""submissionId"":19960016974,""id"":""8e0fcb0baaa145bfb8fe30d8b01bde3e"",""publicationDate"":""1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""199-26-12-09""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19960016974

S."",""Feola, A."",""Raykin, J."",""Samuels, B."",""Ethier, C. R.""]","Space flight induces a marked cephalad (headward) redistribution of blood and interstitial fluid potentially resulting in a loss of venous tone and reduction in heart muscle efficiency upon introduction into the microgravity environment. Using various types of computational models, we are investigating how this fluid redistribution may induce intracranial pressure changes, relevant to reported reductions in astronaut visual acuity, part of the Visual Impairment and Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome. Methods: We utilize a lumped parameter cardiovascular system (CVS) model, augmented by compartments comprising the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) space, as the primary tool to describe how microgravity, and the associated lack of hydrostatic gradient, impacts fluid redistribution. Models of ocular fluid pressures and biomechanics then accept the output of the above model as boundary condition input to allow more detailed, local analysis (see IWS Abstract by Ethier et al.). Recently, we enhanced the capabilities our previously reported CVS model through the implementation of robust autoregulatory mechanisms and a more fundamental approach to the implementation of hydrostatic mechanisms. Modifying the approach of Blanco et al., we implemented auto-regulation in a quasi-static manner, as an averaged effect across the span of one heartbeat. This approach reduced the higher frequency perturbations from the regulatory mechanism and was intended to allow longer simulation times (days) than models that implement within-beat regulatory mechanisms (minutes). A more fundamental approach to hydrostatics was implemented by a quasi-1D approach, in which compartment descriptions include compartment length, orientation and relative position, allowed for modeling of body orientation, relative body positioning and, in the future, alternative gravity environments. At this time the inclusion of hydrostatic mechanisms supplies additional capabilities to train and validate the CVS model with terrestrial data. Results and Conclusions: With the implementation of auto-regulation and hydrostatic modeling capabilities, the model performs as expected in the maintaining the CA (Central Artery) compartment pressure when simulating orientations ranging from supine to standing. The model appears to generally overpredict heart rate and thus cardiac output, possibly indicating sensitivity to the nominal heart rate, which is used as an initial set point of the regulation mechanisms. Despite this sensitivity, the model performs consistently for many hours of simulation time, indicating the success of our quasi-static implementation approach.","[{""submissionId"":20170005266,""id"":""af05f510fa2944ec89ec6c442c6fd946"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20170005266,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""016e67491e7b4e2ba67cb40d37281473""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170005266,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""2dc8f94a7751453dbe19768270381c47"",""id"":""e6b165e2d4654e2aaab58512786f1263""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators Workshop (HRP IWS 2017)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""2dc8f94a7751453dbe19768270381c47"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNC14CA02C"",""WBS 516724.01.02.10""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170005266
20110023150,ABSTRACT,The Effects of Microgravity on Seated Height (Spinal Elongation),"[""Young, K. S."",""Rajulu, S.""]","ABSTRACT Many physiological factors, such as spinal elongation, fluid shifts, bone atrophy, and muscle loss, occur during an exposure to a microgravity environment. Spinal elongation is just one of the factors that can also affect the safety and performance of a crewmember while in space. Spinal elongation occurs due to the lack of gravity/compression on the spinal column. This allows for the straightening of the natural spinal curve. There is a possible fluid shift in the inter-vertebral disks that may also result in changes in height. This study aims at collecting the overall change in seated height for crewmembers exposed to a microgravity environment. During previous Programs, Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) and Skylab, spinal elongation data was collected from a small number of subjects in a standing posture but were limited in scope. Data from these studies indicated a quick increase in stature during the first few days of weightlessness, after which stature growth reached a plateau resulting in up to a 3% increase of the original measurement [1-5]. However, this data was collected only for crewmembers in standing posture and not in a seated posture. Seated height may have a different effect than standing height due to a change in posture as well as due to a compounded effect of wearing restraints and a potential compression of the gluteal area. Seated height was deemed as a critical measurement in the design of the Constellation Program s (CxP) Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), called Orion which is now the point-of-departure vehicle for the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Program; therefore a better understanding of the effects of microgravity on seated height is necessary. Potential changes in seated height that may not have impacted crew accommodation in previous Programs will have significant effects on crew accommodation due to the layout of seats in the Orion.. The current and existing configuration is such that the four crewmembers are stacked two by two with the commander and pilot seats on the top and the two remaining seats underneath, thereby limiting the amount of clearance for the crewmembers seated in the bottom seat. The inner mold line of these types of vehicles are fixed due to other design constraints; therefore, it is essential that all seats incorporate additional clearance to account for adequate spinal growth thereby ensuring that the crew can safely ingress the seat and be strapped in prior to its return to earth. If there is not enough clearance to account for spinal growth deltas between seats then there is the potential that crewmembers will not be able to comfortably and safely fit into their seats. The crewmember in the bottom stacked seat may even have negative clearance with the seat above him or her which could lead to potential ingress/egress issues or potentially injury of the crewmember during landing. These impacts are specific to these types of vehicles with stacked seat configuration. Without proper knowledge of the amount of spinal elongation, or growth, which occurs due to microgravity and space flight, the design of future vehicle(s) or suits may cause injury, discomfort, and limit crew accommodation and crew complements. The experiment primarily aimed to collect seated height data for subjects exposed to microgravity environments, and feed new information regarding the effect of elongation of the spine forward into the design of the Orion. The data collected during the experiment included, two seated height measurement and two digital pictures of seated height pre-, in-, and post-flight. In addition to seated height, crewmembers had an optional task of collecting stature , standing height. Seated height data was obtained from 29 crewmembers that included 8 ISS increment crew (2 females and 6 males) and 21 Shuttle crew (1 female, 20 males), and whose mean age was 48 years ( 4 years). This study utilized the last six Shuttle flights, STS-128 to STS-134. The results show that partipating crewmembers experienced growth up to 6% in seated height and up to 3% in stature. Based on the worst case statistical analysis of the subject data, the recommended seated height growth of 6% will be provided to the designers as the necessary seated height adjustment.","[{""submissionId"":20110023150,""id"":""c0140acc2463488086943bbaff90c461"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110023150,""endDate"":""2012-02-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""a6e4b3b061404118949fcab5dae0345b"",""startDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110023150

20220019338,OTHER,"Risk of Impaired Performance Due to Reduced Muscle Mass, Strength &, Endurance (Short Title: Muscle) and Risk of Reduced Physical Performance Capabilities Due to Reduced Aerobic Capacity (Short Title: Aerobic)","[""Eric Rivas"",""Nicole Strock"",""E. Lichar Dillon"",""Dillon Frisco""]","This report reviews the scientific literature regarding the human system risks to the microgravity environment of space flight in relation to human performance. The primary human performance-related risks involve deconditioning of the cardiovascular and skeletal muscles systems due to prolonged exposure to the reduced gravitational input. The chronological history of U.S. space flight is reviewed as a starting point to inform and understand the gaps in the knowledge to these risks.  

Maintenance of physical performance capabilities involves understanding the health of many organ systems (peripheral [vascular, heart, blood volume, skeletal muscle] and central [brain]) that ultimately contribute to the submaximal and maximal capacity of the aerobic (VO2peak), skeletal muscle (strength and endurance) systems. Maintaining astronaut VO2peak, muscle mass, strength, and endurance before, during, and after space flight is a significant priority to NASA for the current International Space Station (ISS) era, as well as for future exploration missions. A growing research database from both space flight and ground-based analog studies finds that the cardiorespiratory system is compromised and skeletal muscles (predominantly postural muscles of the lower limbs) undergo atrophy. These structural and metabolic responses to living in microgravity conditions contribute to physiological deconditioning during space flight that potentially increase the risks to astronauts returning to surface operations (i.e., Moon, Mars, or Earth). The time course changes from short to long-duration space flight and the relationships between in-flight performance deconditioning levels are not well characterized. Moreover, there are large interindividual variabilities that may be dependent on genetics, age, sex, preflight fitness levels, and individual exercise prescriptions that need further careful evaluations. Efforts should be made to understand the current status of preflight, in-flight, and postflight exercise performance capability and to define the operational goals and target areas for protection with the in-flight exercise program.

There is a bi-directional relationship between exercise prescription and hardware countermeasures that need further understanding in-flight. For example, hardware with limited capabilities/modalities may be counterbalanced by changes in exercise prescription (i.e., frequency, time, intensity, volume) for providing effective responses to maintain fitness. Importantly, the minimal requirements for exercise prescription on ISS hardware may not translate to lower capability hardware on exploration missions. Due to limited volume on exploration vehicles, future Artemis missions to the Lunar surface will not have similar exercise hardware capabilities as ISS. This may alter the effectiveness of hardware to provide adequate physiological stress on  bodily systems  allowing for adaptations to maintain aerobic capacity, strength, and bone density. Thus, it will be important to understand the exercise responses of current ISS countermeasures to develop individualized exercise prescriptions that minimize aerobic and muscular risks, accounting for the large variability of responses among crewmembers. Newer exploration exercise hardware is currently being evaluated that is more compact (i.e., E4D and Orion Flywheel) and will require careful evaluation of  the hardware on the stressor (i.e., metabolic rate, oxygen uptake, and heart rate work relationships, and force plate load profiles) needed the human body to protect and maintain crew health and performance. Moreover, exercise responses on the hardware need careful evaluation on the chronic adaptations. Lastly, in-flight evaluation of hardware exercise response may differ in 0-g or partial-g compared to 1-g. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the stress on the body will be the same in each environment. Understanding this has a direct impact on exercise prescriptions.

This document provides an overview of key scientific investigations that have been conducted before, during, and after human space flight missions, as well as from human ground-based analog studies that contribute to the evidence base on changes in aerobic capacity and muscle mass, strength, and endurance. Additional data from rodent and nonhuman primate experiments of skeletal muscle unloading completed during space flight or ground-based flight-simulations provide supportive information about this risk topic. Most importantly, a recent, large dataset from long-duration ISS crew has been added to give improved insight into the variability of exercise response of crew, demonstrating that a large portion of the crew population return to Earth with greater than 10-20% loss of aerobic capacity and muscle strength and endurance. Data from human space flight and ground-based studies are narrowing in on the required exercise paradigms but thus far still provide an incomplete answer to an effective approach for maintaining skeletal muscle function and aerobic fitness of all human space travelers. Finally, the relationship of this risk topic to various space flight operational scenarios is examined and discussed.","[{""submissionId"":20220019338,""id"":""6e1a19dd5152406ab8acf036d1ce9a32"",""publicationDate"":""2023-04-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""2.3.7.1.0978""]",undefined,"[""Quality Assurance and Reliability"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220019338

Soleus biopsies were obtained from four male astronauts 45 days before and within 2 h after a 17 day spaceflight. 2. For all astronauts, single chemically skinned post-flight fibres expressing only type I myosin heavy chain (MHC) developed less average peak Ca2+ activated force (Po) during fixed-end contractions (0.78 +/- 0. 02 vs. 0.99 +/- 0.03 mN) and shortened at a greater mean velocity during unloaded contractions (Vo) (0.83 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.02 fibre lengths s-1) than pre-flight type I fibres. 3. The flight-induced decline in absolute Po was attributed to reductions in fibre diameter and/or Po per fibre cross-sectional area. Fibres from the astronaut who experienced the greatest relative loss of peak force also displayed a reduction in Ca2+ sensitivity. 4. The elevated Vo of the post-flight slow type I fibres could not be explained by alterations in myosin heavy or light chain composition. One alternative possibility is that the elevated Vo resulted from an increased myofilament lattice spacing. This hypothesis was supported by electron micrographic analysis demonstrating a reduction in thin filament density post-flight. 5. Post-flight fibres shortened at 30 % higher velocities than pre-flight fibres at external loads associated with peak power output. This increase in shortening velocity either reduced (2 astronauts) or prevented (2 astronauts) a post-flight loss in fibre absolute peak power (microN (fibre length) s-1). 6. The changes in soleus fibre diameter and function following spaceflight were similar to those observed after 17 days of bed rest. Although in-flight exercise countermeasures probably reduced the effects of microgravity, the results support the idea that ground-based bed rest can serve as a model of human spaceflight. 7. In conclusion, 17 days of spaceflight decreased force and increased shortening velocity of single Ca2+-activated muscle cells expressing type I MHC. The increase in shortening velocity greatly reduced the impact that impaired force production had on absolute peak power.","[{""volume"":""516 ( Pt 3)"",""submissionId"":20040142002,""issn"":""0022-3751"",""id"":""d5747d801548474280294d6e0e3f4004"",""publicationName"":""The Journal of physiology"",""publicationDate"":""1999-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040142002
20040087470,REPRINT,Mechanisms of microgravity induced orthostatic intolerance: implications for effective countermeasures,"[""Convertino, Victor A.""]","The development of orthostatic hypotension and instability immediately after return from spaceflight has been a significant operational problem to astronauts for more than four decades. Significant reductions in stroke volume and peripheral vascular resistance contribute to ineffective maintenance of systemic arterial blood pressure during standing after spaceflight despite compensatory elevations in heart rate. The primary mechanism underlying reduced stroke volume appears to be a reduction in preload associated with reduced circulating blood volume, although cardiac atrophy might also contribute. Space flight and ground based experiments have demonstrated that an inability to provide adequate peripheral vasoconstriction in astronauts that become presyncopal may be associated with several mechanisms including reduced sympathetic nerve activity, arterial smooth muscle atrophy and/or hyporeactivity, hypersensitivity of beta-adrenergic receptors, etc. In addition, an inability to provide adequate tachycardia in presyncopal subjects may be associated with reduced carotid-cardiac baroreflex sensitivity. Based on the current knowledge and understanding of cardiovascular mechanisms that are altered during exposure to microgravity, a major focus of future research should be directed to the systematic evaluation of potential countermeasures that specifically target and restore the function of these mechanisms. Based on a preliminary systematic evaluation presented in this review, acute physical exercise designed to elicit maximal effort, G-suit inflation, artificial gravity, and specific pharmacological interventions, alone or in combination, have shown promise as successful countermeasures that provide protection against post-flight orthostatic intolerance.","[{""volume"":""9"",""submissionId"":20040087470,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""1077-9248"",""id"":""fad8c2351cf74983ac7d80fdaadfec10"",""publicationName"":""Journal of gravitational physiology :  a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology"",""publicationDate"":""2002-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040087470

Adaptation of the sympathetic nervous system occurring during spaceflight may be responsible for these postflight alterations. We tested the hypotheses that exposure to microgravity reduces sympathetic neural outflow and impairs sympathetic neural responses to orthostatic stress. We measured heart rate, photoplethysmographic finger arterial pressure, peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic activity and plasma noradrenaline spillover and clearance, in male astronauts before, during (flight day 12 or 13) and after the 16 day Neurolab space shuttle mission. Measurements were made during supine rest and orthostatic stress, as simulated on Earth and in space by 7 min periods of 15 and 30 mmHg lower body suction. Mean (+/- S.E.M.) heart rates before lower body suction were similar pre-flight and in flight. Heart rate responses to -30 mmHg were greater in flight (from 56 +/- 4 to 72 +/- 4 beats min(-1)) than pre-flight (from 56 +/- 4 at rest to 62 +/- 4 beats min(-1), P < 0.05). Noradrenaline spillover and clearance were increased from pre-flight levels during baseline periods and during lower body suction, both in flight (n = 3) and on post-flight days 1 or 2 (n = 5, P < 0.05). In-flight baseline sympathetic nerve activity was increased above pre-flight levels (by 10-33 %) in the same three subjects in whom noradrenaline spillover and clearance were increased. The sympathetic response to 30 mmHg lower body suction was at pre-flight levels or higher in each subject (35 pre-flight vs. 40 bursts min(-1) in flight). No astronaut experienced presyncope during lower body suction in space (or during upright tilt following the Neurolab mission). We conclude that in space, baseline sympathetic neural outflow is increased moderately and sympathetic responses to lower body suction are exaggerated. Therefore, notwithstanding hypovolaemia, astronauts respond normally to simulated orthostatic stress and are able to maintain their arterial pressures at normal levels.","[{""volume"":""538"",""submissionId"":20040088546,""issue"":""Pt 1"",""issn"":""0022-3751"",""id"":""87befd9b799f4ce8b6fde196da70d326"",""publicationName"":""The Journal of physiology"",""publicationDate"":""2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""5P01 HL56693"",""1U01HL53206"",""1U01NS33460"",""M01 RR00095""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088546

Recording began two days into the spaceflight and showed that the media gastrocnemius was recruited preferentially over the soleus.  This observation persisted throughout the flight and for the 2 week period of postflight testing.

Aging, sedentary lifestyle, and spaceflight have similar degenerative effects on almost every part of our body; both exposure to the space environment and aging result in cardiovascular deconditioning, bone loss, muscle atrophy, brain changes, and immune response impairment. We hypothesize that exposure to the space environment generates excessive Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which results in neuroinflammation and aging-like degenerative symptoms in the brain. We used the hindlimb unloading (HU) model to mimic microgravity with either paired or single housed animals (social isolation). Responses to 30d (30 days) of HU were compared in wildtype or transgenic MCAT (Mitochondrial-targeted CATalase) mice, in which mitochondrial ROS is quenched by over-expression of human catalase. Expression of 4-Hydroxynonenal (4HNE) and Park7 (redox-sensitive chaperone and sensor of oxidative stress) were measured by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay), a protein array quantified from the hippocampal cytokines and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in serum was measured by ELISA to assess oxidative DNA damage. Preliminary analysis of cage behavior patterns from video collected at the end of the study showed that MCAT HU mice (socially housed) were more active and conducted more exploratory activities compared to NL (Normally Loaded). Our biochemical results showed simulated microgravity and/or social isolation caused changes in levels of cytokines related to immune responses. Two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) revealed significant interaction effects of HU and genotype in expression levels of five cytokines (out of 35) in socially-housed animals. Elevation of these generally pro-inflammatory cytokines by HU in WT (Wild Type) mice was mitigated in MCAT mice, suggesting a role for mitochondrial ROS signaling in inflammatory CNS (Central Nervous System) responses to microgravity. Interestingly, some of these cytokines in the hippocampus displayed strong correlations to the 4HNE levels. We also found substantive cytokine responses to social isolation in the hippocampus; housing and genotype interaction effects were significant (by 2-Factor ANOVA) for 15 cytokines, most of which were mitigated in MCAT mice.Taken together, our results showed that both simulated microgravity and social isolation influenced cytokine levels in the hippocampus and MCAT mice were at least partially protected from these changes. These findings implicate a potentially important role for mitochondrial ROS in CNS responses to the challenges posed by long duration spaceflight.","[{""submissionId"":20190002784,""id"":""9426600f89294c46a2cd3243bd448a29"",""publicationDate"":""2019-04-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190002784,""endDate"":""2019-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""2d5413f506e14d63bc85f9b5b306736f"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Physiological Society"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6d7ee03d56cf46ed87e6b91a999f4820"",""id"":""dfd69c52cb1942da8328c5b77c925bd3""}],""name"":""Experimental Biology"",""location"":""Orlando, FL"",""id"":""6d7ee03d56cf46ed87e6b91a999f4820"",""startDate"":""2019-04-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""80NSSC18M0060"",""NNH15CO48B""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190002784

Brent"",""Perusek, Gail P."",""Lewandowski, Beth E."",""Samorezov, Sergey""]","Astronauts regularly perform treadmill locomotion as a part of their exercise prescription while onboard the International Space Station. Although locomotive exercise has been shown to be beneficial for bone, muscle, and cardiovascular health, astronauts return to Earth after long duration missions with net losses in all three areas [1]. These losses might be partially explained by fundamental differences in locomotive performance between normal gravity (NG) and microgravity (MG) environments. During locomotive exercise in MG, the subject must wear a waist and shoulder harness that is attached to elastomer bungees. The bungees are attached to the treadmill, and provide forces that are intended to replace gravity. However, unlike gravity, which provides a constant force upon all body parts, the bungees provide a spring force only to the harness. Therefore, subjects are subjected to two fundamental differences in MG: 1) forces returning the subject to the treadmill are not constant, and 2) forces are only applied to the axial skeleton at the waist and shoulders. The effectiveness of the exercise may also be affected by the magnitude of the gravity replacement load. Historically, astronauts have difficulty performing treadmill exercise with loads that approach body weight (BW) due to comfort and inherent stiffness in the bungee system. Although locomotion can be executed in MG, the unique requirements could result in performance differences as compared to NG. These differences may help to explain why long term training effects of treadmill exercise may differ from those found in NG. The purpose of this investigation was to compare locomotion in NG and MG to determine if kinematic or muscular activation pattern differences occur between gravitational environments.","[{""submissionId"":20090014189,""id"":""9ee13262f16749969dc778832a157265"",""publicationDate"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20090014189,""endDate"":""2009-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""ee5da962a1214627acf5b0bc1e78b560"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Pennsylvania State Univ."",""location"":""PA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6e58a1f77dbc4616ac9b1bb464cfd0ec"",""id"":""5c9ffd32d26843478ed10bfe619c0e26""}],""name"":""American Society of Biomechanics 2009 Annual Meeting"",""location"":""PA"",""id"":""6e58a1f77dbc4616ac9b1bb464cfd0ec"",""startDate"":""2009-08-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090014189

The primary baroreceptors are located in the main blood vessel leaving the heart (the aorta) and in the arteries in the neck (the carotid arteries). The brain uses information from the baroreceptors to determine whether blood pressure should be raised or lowered. These reflex responses are called baroreflexes. Changing position within a gravity field (i.e., moving from lying to sitting or standing) powerfully stimulates the baroreflexes. In weightlessness, the amount of stimuli that the baroreflexes receive is dramatically reduced. If this reduction occurs when the pathways that control the baroreflexes are being formed, it is possible that either the structure or function of the baroreceptors may be permanently changed. To study the effect of microgravity on structural and functional development of the aortic baroreflex system, we studied young rats (eight days old at launch) that flew on the Space Shuttle Columbia for 16 days. Six rats were studied on landing day; another six were studied after re-adapting to Earth's gravity for 30 days. On both landing day and 30 days after landing, we tested the sensitivity of the rats' baroreflex response. While the rats were anaesthetized, we recorded their arterial pressure, heart rate, and aortic nerve activity. After the tissues were preserved with perfusion fixation, we also examined the baroreflex structures. On landing day, we found that, compared to the controls, the flight rats had: fewer unmyelinated nerve fibers in their aortic nerves lower baroreflex sensitivity significantly lower contraction ability and wall tension of the aorta a reduced number of smooth muscle cells in the aorta. In the 30-day recovery group, the sensitivity of the baroreflex showed no difference between the flight rats and the control groups, although the unmyelinated fibers of the aortic nerve remained reduced in the flight rats. The results show that spaceflight does affect the development of the aortic baroreflex. The sensitivity of the reflex may be suppressed; however, the function of the blood pressure control system can re-adapt to Earth's gravity if the rats return before maturation. The structural differences in the input pathway of the reflex (Le., the reduction in nerve fibers) may remain permanently.","[{""submissionId"":20030068216,""id"":""94566776d98e48e58866abeb5eaa7eca"",""publicationName"":""The Neurolab Spacelab Mission: Neuroscience Research in Space: Results from the STS-90, Neurolab Spacelab Mission"",""publicationDate"":""2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""MOE-08407004""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20030068190,""title"":""The Neurolab Spacelab Mission: Neuroscience Research in Space: Results from the STS-90, Neurolab Spacelab Mission""},{""id"":20030068190,""title"":""The Neurolab Spacelab Mission: Neuroscience Research in Space: Results from the STS-90, Neurolab Spacelab Mission""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20030068216

The purpose of this study was therefore to assess the changes due to weightless on the enzyme patterns composed by the individual fibers within the flight muscles. In spite of the limitation in numbers of muscles examined, it is apparent that: (1) that the size of individual fibers (i.e., their dry weight) was reduced about a third, (2) that this loss in dry mass was accompanied by changes in the eight enzymes studied, and (3) that these changes were different for the two muscles, and different for the two enzyme groups. In the soleus muscle the absolute amounts of the three enzymes of oxidative metabolism decreased about in proportion to the dry weight loss, so that their concentration in the atrophic fibers was almost unchanged. In contrast, there was little loss among the four enzymes of glycogenolysis - glycolysis so that their concentrations were substantially increased in the atrophic fibers. In the TA muscle, these seven enzymes were affected in just the opposite direction. There appeared to be no absolute loss among the oxidative enzymes, whereas the glycogenolytic enzymes were reduced by nearly half, so that the concentrations of the first metabolic group were increased within the atrophic fibers and the concentrations of the second group were only marginally decreased. The behavior of hexokinase was exceptional in that it did not decrease in absolute terms in either type of muscle and probably increased as much as 50 percent in soleus. Thus, their was a large increase in concentration of this enzyme in the atrophied fibers of both muscles. Another clear-cut finding was the large increase in the range of activities of the glycolytic enzymes among individual fibers of TA muscles. This was due to the emergence of TA fibers with activities for enzymes of this group extending down to levels as low as those found in control soleus muscles. It would be interesting to know if this represents a transition stage, and whether with prolonged weightlessness most of the fibers would be transformed into a low glycogenolytic type.","[{""submissionId"":19900017158,""id"":""34442d86d54244af87f81b60b60546d3"",""publicationName"":""NASA, Ames Research Center, The US Experiments Flown on the Soviet Biosatellite Cosmos 1887"",""publicationDate"":""1990-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19900017158

These observations suggest that anabolic adjuvants and muscle tension do not interact to stimulate growth or maintenance of slow-twitch skeletal muscle. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a chronic increase in mechanical loading (synergistic ablation) or hindlimb unweighting (hindlimb suspension) interact with exogenous GH and IGF-I (Genentech, So San Francisco, CA) in the slow-twitch soleus muscles of female rats (approx. 250 g). Bilateral ablation of the plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles induced 38% and 40% increases in the absolute (mg/pair) and relative (mg/100 g body weight) weights of the soleus, respectively (p less than or = 0.05), in ambulatory rats. GH and IGF-I interacted with chronic loading to increase absolute soleus mass an additional 20% (p less than or = 0.05), and mixed and myofibrillar protein contents an additional 12% and 7%, respectively (NS). In contrast, hindlimb suspension (HLS) resulted in 20% and 18% decreases in the absolute and relative weights of the soleus, respectively (p less than or = 0.05); GH and IGF-I did not spare loss of soleus mass or protein content in HLS rats. HLS decreased tibial plate thickness approx. 11% (p less than or = 0.05), but not weights of the tibia or femus. GH and IGF-I increased tibial plate thickness approx. 30% (p less than or = 0.05), in ambulatory and HLS rats, and increased femur and tibial weights 12% (p less than or = 0.05) and 8% (NS), respectively, in ambulatory rats, but had no effect in HLS rats. Results of the present investigation suggest that GH and IGF-I can stimulate hypertrophy of slow-twitch skeletal muscle when chronically overloaded, but can also stimulate growth of hindlimb bones in the absence of mechanical load.","[{""submissionId"":20010125388,""id"":""4460c6a7df21471b84b7a3aa74eab181"",""publicationDate"":""1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20010125388,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""f6faa0950a0c4218b2f79457ebba70dc""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20010125388,""endDate"":""1994-10-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""ff3b2c08b91f4e26aac2ba7020eff5dc"",""id"":""74a8dd2b8ee8426786b5ddca0627788b""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology Meeting"",""location"":""San Francisco, CA"",""id"":""ff3b2c08b91f4e26aac2ba7020eff5dc"",""startDate"":""1994-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""RTOP 199-70-12-14""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20010125388

Experiments in flight and after flight and ground-based bedrest studies have associated microgravity and its experimental paradigms with manifestations similar to those of diabetes, physical inactivity, and aging. We propose that these manifestations are characterized best by an etiology that falls into the clinical category of ""other"" causes of diabetes, including, but not restricted to, genetic beta-cell defects, insulin action defects, diseases of the endocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, drug or chemically induced diabetes, infections, immune-mediated metabolic alteration, and a host of genetic related diseases. We present data showing alterations in tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, insulin secretion, and amino acid metabolism in pancreatic islets of Langerhans cultured in a ground-based cell culture bioreactor that mimics some of the effects of microgravity. Taken together, space flight research, ground-based studies, and bioreactor studies of pancreatic islets of Langerhans support the hypothesis that the pancreas is unable to overcome peripheral insulin resistance and amino acid dysregulation during space flight.

Previous studies analyzing exercise within lower body negative pressure (LBNP) have found that gait is similar in LBNP on a vertical treadmill and overground exercise on a horizontal treadmill. Since treadmill exercise is known to increase muscular strength and endurance, we tested the hypothesis that LBNP exercise on a vertical treadmill would prevent or attenuate many of the physical decrements which occur during bedrest. Based on our positive results from diverse tests of post-BR function, we believe that exercise within LBNP is worth pursuing as a countermeasure for reducing the physical deterioration that occurs during bedrest and microgravity.","[{""submissionId"":20020039748,""id"":""c04390bea9db4c399a4eb0047a197f30"",""publicationDate"":""1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20020039748,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""2bf2622c7817484dbef887f60d75bbc3""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20020039748,""endDate"":""1997-05-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""5a0c9a26734b4115b9056d2a08df6844"",""id"":""3cef63841d424c2eb7d5543cf447fe3d""}],""name"":""Aerospace Medicine Association Meeting"",""location"":""Chicago, IL"",""id"":""5a0c9a26734b4115b9056d2a08df6844"",""startDate"":""1997-05-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""RTOP 199-26-12-34"",""RTOP 199-26-12-38""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020039748

In the Gecko experiment aboard Foton M-2, we flew for the first time, five terrestrial Pachydactylus turneri specimens to develop a model of microgravity effects comparable to the newt Pleurodeles waltl, a well-established model organism for spaceflight. These lower vertebrate species have similar body plans and size, are poikilothermic, have tissue regenerative ability, and are adapted to moderate periods of fasting. Furthermore the gecko (Pachydactylus) can also survive prolonged periods without water. In pre-flight control experiments and after a 16-day Foton M-2 spaceflight without food or water, the geckos were recovered and showed no apparent negative health effects. However, detailed analysis of bone mass and architecture by micro Computed Tomography { pCT), showed that both synchronous control and spaceflight animals lost significant amounts of cancellous bone in the distal femur and humerus relative to basal controls. In addition, cell cycle analysis of 30h post-flight liver tissue reveals a shift of DNA content from G2 and S to G1, both in spaceflight and synchronous controls. Together, these results suggest that housing conditions alone induce rapid catabolism of cancellous bone and reduced normal tissue regeneration. Further use of the gecko Puchydactylus turneri as a spaceflight model requires modification of housing conditions, possibly by including water and food, or changing other factors such as eliminating housing stresses to obtain stable bone structure and tissue regeneration during spaceflight experiments.","[{""submissionId"":20070022709,""id"":""b69889f1f1634619a6a9d3fd73201422"",""publicationName"":""Journal of Gravitational Physiology, Volume 13, No. 1"",""publicationDate"":""2006-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG9-1458""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20070022623,""title"":""Journal of Gravitational Physiology, Volume 13, No. 1""},{""id"":20070022623,""title"":""Journal of Gravitational Physiology, Volume 13, No. 1""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070022709

The purpose of this paper is to see what can be learnt about the muscle loss problem by comparing metabolic results across the six missions for which data are available and against bed rest.

The bones and the muscles will begin to deteriorate after a short stay in weightlessness. Bone decalcification appears to be a major problem with extensive living in microgravity. Resistance exercise is not only essential to prevent muscle atrophy in space, it also helps to keep bone decalcification in check. For a space station, where the astronauts are expected to live for months at a time, exercise is especially important. Experts recommend about an hour and a half to two hours of exercise per day to keep the muscles in good condition in microgravity. The exercises will not only keep the astronauts in excellent physical condition, it will also make it easier for them to readjust to earth's gravity on return. The stationary bicycle and the treadmill have been the astronauts' primary sources of exercise since the 1970's. The major problem with both the stationary bicycle and the treadmill is that while they may keep the leg muscles from deteriorating in microgravity, they do little for muscles in the upper body.

Our earlier study showed that voltage-operated calcium channels, the MAPK pathway [1], and vasoconstrictive prostaglandins contribute to the NE-induced contraction of control (C) but not HU, aorta rings. Genistein, a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, caused a significant reduction in vascular contractility in C but not HU arteries. The present study explored the role of protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular receptor-activated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in the HU-induced vascular hyporesponsiveness to NE. Microgravity was simulated in Wistar rats by 20 day HU. The abdominal aorta was removed from control and HU rats, cut into 3 mm rings, and mounted in tissue baths to measure isometric contraction. Protein levels were determined using Western blot analysis. PD98059, a selective MAPKK inhibitor, caused a marked inhibition of NE-induced contraction in both C and HU arteries. Calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor, completely abolished the contractile response to NE in both C and HU tissues. Phosphorylated (activated) ERK1/2 protein mass was greater in C, compared to HU, aortas, and was reduced by genistein only in C tissues. MAPK total protein levels in the rat aorta were increased in the HU-treated, compared to C, animals. These results indicate that PKC represents an early transduction step in the contractile response to NE in the rat abdominal aorta. That inhibition of the step immediately before activation of MAPK reduced contraction in both C and HU tissues, while general tyrosine kinase inhibition with genistein blocked only the control responses, suggests that a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase may be involved in HU-induced vascular hyporesponsiveness to NE.","[{""volume"":""43"",""submissionId"":20040112693,""issn"":""0083-8969"",""id"":""ffb19bba0e6547e6bd4fcae523ec59d7"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings of the Western Pharmacology Society"",""publicationDate"":""2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040112693

These validated and optimized exercise countermeasures systems will be provided to the ISS Program and MPCV Program for subsequent flight development and operations. The International Space Station (ISS) currently has three major pieces of operational exercise countermeasures hardware: the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), the second-generation (T2) treadmill, and the cycle ergometer with vibration isolation system (CEVIS). This suite of exercise countermeasures hardware serves as a benchmark and is a vast improvement over previous generations of countermeasures hardware, providing both aerobic and resistive exercise for the crew. However, vehicle and resource constraints for future exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit will require that the exercise countermeasures hardware mass, volume, and power be minimized, while preserving the current ISS capabilities or even enhancing these exercise capabilities directed at mission specific physiological functional performance and medical standards requirements. Further, mission-specific considerations such as preservation of sensorimotor function, autonomous and adaptable operation, integration with medical data systems, rehabilitation, and in-flight monitoring and feedback are being developed for integration with the exercise countermeasures systems. Numerous technologies have been considered and evaluated against HRP-approved functional device requirements for these extreme mission profiles, and include wearable sensors, exoskeletons, flywheel, pneumatic, and closed-loop microprocessor controlled motor driven systems. Each technology has unique advantages and disadvantages. The Advanced Exercise Concepts project oversees development of candidate next generation exercise countermeasures hardware, performs trade studies of current and state of the art exercise technologies, manages and supports candidate systems physiological evaluations with human test subjects on the ground, in flight analogs and flight. The near term goal is evaluation of candidate systems in flight, culminating in an integrated candidate next generation exercise countermeasures suite on the ISS which coalesces research findings from HRP disciplines in the areas of exercise performance for muscle, bone, cardiovascular, sensorimotor, behavioral health, and nutrition for optimal benefit to the crew.","[{""submissionId"":20160012339,""id"":""d7bf44ac2caf471ebe63b1bbbef7ba1e"",""publicationDate"":""2015-02-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160012339,""endDate"":""2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b35732f6fdf341ea9d90f442294ff699"",""id"":""6fee0121ea5a4cf1956b3c28d06271ce""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""b35732f6fdf341ea9d90f442294ff699"",""startDate"":""2016-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 516724.01.02.10"",""NNJ11HE31A""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160012339

NASA's Exercise Countermeasures Project (ECP) provides space exploration exercise hardware and monitoring requirements that lead to devices that are reliable, meet medical, vehicle, and habitat constraints, and use minimal vehicle and crew resources. ECP will also develop and validate efficient exercise prescriptions that minimize daily time needed for completion of exercise yet maximize performance for mission activities. In meeting these mission goals, NASA Glenn Research Center (Cleveland, OH, USA), in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, Ohio, USA), has developed a suite of zero-gravity locomotion simulators and associated technologies to address the need for ground-based test analog capability for simulating in-flight (microgravity) and surface (partial-gravity) exercise to advance the health and safety of astronaut crews and the next generation of space explorers. Various research areas can be explored. These include improving crew comfort during exercise, and understanding joint kinematics and muscle activation pattern differences relative to external loading mechanisms. In addition, exercise protocol and hardware optimization can be investigated, along with characterizing system dynamic response and the physiological demand associated with advanced exercise device concepts and performance of critical mission tasks for Exploration class missions. Three zero-gravity locomotion simulators are currently in use and the research focus for each will be presented. All of the devices are based on a supine subject suspension system, which simulates a reduced gravity environment by completely or partially offloading the weight of the exercising test subject s body. A platform for mounting treadmill is positioned perpendicularly to the test subject. The Cleveland Clinic Zero-g Locomotion Simulator (ZLS) utilizes a pneumatic subject load device to apply a near constant gravity-replacement load to the test subject during exercise, and is currently used in conjunction with the General Clinical Research Center for evaluating exercise protocols using a bedrest analog. The enhanced ZLS (eZLS) at NASA Glenn Research Center features an offloaded treadmill that floats on a thin film of air and interfaces to a force reaction frame via variably-compliant isolators, or vibration isolation system. The isolators can be configured to simulate compliant interfaces to the vehicle, which affects mechanical loading to crewmembers during exercise, and has been used to validate system dynamic models for new countermeasures equipment designs, such as the second International Space Station treadmill slated for use in 2010. In the eZLS, the test subject and exercise device can be pitched at the appropriate angle for partial gravity simulations, such as lunar gravity (1/6th earth gravity). On both the eZLS and the NASA-Johnson Space Center standalone ZLS installed at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas, USA, the subject's body weight relative to the treadmill is controlled via a linear motor subject load device (LM-SLD). The LM-SLD employs a force-feedback closed-loop control system to provide a relatively constant force to the test subject during locomotion, and is set and verified for subject safety prior to each session. Locomotion data were collected during parabolic flight and on the eZLS. The purpose was to determine the similarities and differences between locomotion in actual and simulated microgravity. Subjects attained greater amounts of hip flexion during walking and running during parabolic flight. During running, subjects had greater hip range of motion. Trunk motion was significantly less on the eZLS than during parabolic flight. Peak impact forces, loading rate, and impulse were greater on the eZLS than during parabolic while walking with a low external load (EL) and rning with a high EL. Activation timing differences existed between locations in all muscles except for the rectus femoris. The tibialis anterior and gluteus maximus were active for longer durations on the eZLS than in parabolic flight during walking. Ground reaction forces were greater with the LM-SLD than with bungees during eZLS locomotion. While the eZLS serves as a ground-based analog, researchers should be aware that subtle, but measurable, differences in kinematics and leg musculature activities exist between the environments. Aside from space applications, zero-gravity locomotion simulators may help medical researchers in the future with development of rehabilitative or therapeutic protocols for injured or ill patients. Zero-gravity locomotion simulators may be used as a ground-based test bed to support future missions for space exploration, and eventually may be used to simulate planetary locomotion in partial gravity environments, including the Moon and Mars.

The objective of our proposed project is to (1) develop a fully integrated disposable microelectrode array chip (with the size of a stamp) that can be interfaced with a handheld electronic system for simultaneous detection of the a panel of biomarkers to monitor the progression of skeletal muscle atrophy due to disuse under microgravity in long-duration spaceflights; and (2) use such quantitative information to guide the combined countermeasures of physical exercise and pharmaceuticals (i.e. specific protease inhibitors) so that the intensity, duration and frequency of exercise can be reduced.

Spaceflight provides the only microgravity environment where systematic experimentation can expand our basic understanding of gravitational physiology and perhaps provide new insights into normal physiology and disease processes. These include the surprising extent of our body's dependence on perceptual information, and understanding the effect and importance of forces generated within the body's weightbearing structures such as muscle and bones.

Recovery of muscle upon return to a 1-G environment is well studied, however, far less is known about the rate and completeness of BMD recovery to pre-flight values. Using the mature tail-suspended adult rat model, this proposal will focus on the temporal course of recovery in tibial bone following a 28-d period of skeletal unloading. Through the study of bone density and muscle strength in the same animal, time-points during recovery from simulated microgravity will be identified when bone is at an elevated risk for fracture. These will occur due to the rapid recovery of muscle strength coupled with a slower recovery of bone, producing a significant mismatch in functional strength of these two tissues. Once the time-point of maximal mismatch is defined, various mechanical and pharmacological interventions will be tested at and around this time-point in attempt to minimize the functional difference of bone and muscle. The outcomes of this research will have high relevance for optimizing the rehabilitation of astronauts upon return to Earth, as well as upon landing on the Martian surface before assuming arduous physical tasks. Further. it will impact significantly on rehabilitation issues common to patients experiencing long periods of limb immobilization or bed rest.","[{""submissionId"":20020087591,""id"":""3a7a72ae6fe64299bc14809d433cd41a"",""publicationName"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute"",""publicationDate"":""2002-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NCC9-58""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20020087588,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""},{""id"":20020087588,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020087591

Though the overall technical specifications are similar, each GBX's crew interface is unique. JSC conducted a series of ergonomic evaluations of the various glovebox designs to identify human factors requirements for new designs to provide operator commonality across different designs. We conducted 2 0g evaluations aboard the Shuttle to evaluate the material sciences GBX and the General Purpose Workstation (GPWS), and a KC-135 evaluation to compare combinations of arm hole interfaces and foot restraints (flexible arm holes were better than rigid ports for repetitive fine manipulation tasks). Posture analysis revealed that the smallest and tallest subjects assumed similar postures at all four configurations, suggesting that problematic postures are not necessarily a function of the operator s height but a function of the task characteristics. There was concern that the subjects were using the restrictive nature of the GBX s cuffs as an upper-body restraint to achieve such high forces, which might lead to neck/shoulder discomfort. EMG data revealed more consistent muscle performance at the GBX; the variability in the EMG profiles observed at the GPWS was attributed to the subjects attempts to provide more stabilization for themselves in the loose, flexible gauntlets. Tests revealed that the GBX should be designed for a 95 percentile American male to accommodate a neutral working posture. In addition, the foot restraint with knee support appeared beneficial for GBX operations. Crew comments were to provide 2 foot restraint mechanical modes, loose and lock-down, to accommodate a wide range of tasks without egressing the restraint system. Thus far, we have developed preliminary design guidelines for GBXs and foot.","[{""submissionId"":20040200955,""id"":""d4808605992e4b5e98ed96e61c63c942"",""publicationDate"":""1996-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAS9-18800""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040200955
19930016879,OTHER,The role of pyridoxine as a countermeasure for in-flight loss of lean body mass,"[""Gilbert, Joyce A.""]","Ground based and in flight research has shown that humans, under conditions of microgravity, sustain a loss of lean body tissue (protein) and changes in several biological processes including, reductions in red blood cell mass, and neurotransmitters. The maintenance of muscle mass, the major component of lean body mass, is required to meet the needs of space station EVAs. Central to the biosynthesis of amino acids, the building blocks of protein, is pyridoxine (vitamin B-6). Muscle mass integrity requires the availability of vitamin B-6 for protein metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. Furthermore, the formation of red blood cells require pyridoxine as a cofactor in the biosynthesis of hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen to tissues. In its active form, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), vitamin B-6 serves as a link between amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism through intermediates of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition to its role in energy metabolism, PLP is involved in the biosynthesis of hemoglobin and neurotransmitter which are necessary for neurological functions. Alterations in pyridoxine metabolism may affect countermeasures designed to overcome some of these biochemical changes. The focus of this research is to determine the effects of microgravity on the metabolic utilization of vitamin B-6, integrating nutrition as an integral component of the countermeasure (exercise) to maintain lean body mass and muscle strength. The objectives are: 1) to determine whether microgravity effects the metabolic utilization of pyridoxine and 2) to quantitate changes in B-6 vitamer distribution in tissue and excreta relative to loss of lean body tissue. The rationale for this study encompasses the unique challenge to control biochemical mechanisms effected during space travel and the significance of pyridoxine to maintain and counter muscle integrity for EVA activities. This experiment will begin to elucidate the importance of biochemical interactions between micronutrients and the homeostasis condition of biological processes in the space environment. To address this research topic a simulated microgravity model has been developed. The experiment uses radioisotopically labelled pyridoxine administered as an oral dose to rats which are maintained by tail suspension to simulate a microgravity environment. At the termination of the study, liver, muscle, blood and urine are collected and analyzed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography to determine the quantity and distribution of the B-6 vitamers in tissue and excreta relative to lean body tissue loss. Earlier studies, published by this investigator, have shown that differences in vitamer distribution among samples from experimental versus control subjects indicate changes in metabolic utilization and storage of vitamin B-6.","[{""submissionId"":19930016879,""id"":""0d9f12ac56e74a4eaac41ec4516122c3"",""publicationName"":""NASA.

D.""]","The etiology of orthostatic intolerance after spaceflight is multifaceted. Morphological adaptations, in particular cardiac atrophy, are likely to magnify the decrease in stroke volume that occurs with reductions in cardiac filling pressure when standing. Neural adaptations may be inferred as well, as reductions in carotid-cardiac baroreflex responsiveness have been reported following bedrest deconditioning and spaceflight. Neural control of vascular resistance has not been studied directly when orthostatic intolerance is florid in the hours following spaceflight. However, the increases in systemic vascular resistance and plasma catecholamines during orthostatic stress are inappropriately low in orthostatically intolerant subjects following spaceflight, suggesting that deficits in the regulation of vascular resistance may be associated with hypoadrenergic function. The studies described in this abstract were designed to test this hypothesis.","[{""submissionId"":20000020559,""id"":""a62ebf3fcda443ddae15d15f13efb724"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAGW-3582"",""NAS9-19429"",""NAS9-19573"",""NAGW-4389""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""},{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000020559

Based on observations of fixed tissue, it was evident that some rats in the flight and vivarium groups had testicular abnormalities unassociated with treatment, and probably existing when they were assigned randomly to the four treatment groups; the simulated-launch group contained no abnormal rat. Lesions induced in testes of caudal-elevation rats precluded discernment of any pre-existing abnormality. Considering rats without pre-existing abnormalities, diameter of seminiferous tubules and numbers of germ cells per tubule cross section were lower (E less than 0.05) in flight rats than in simulated-launch or vivarium rats. However, ratios of germ cells to each other, or to Sertoli cells, and number of homogenization-resistant spermatids did not differ from values for simulated-launch or vivarium controls. There was no effect of flight on normal expression of testis-specific hsp gene products, or evidence for production of stress-inducible transcripts of the hsp70 or hsp90 genes. Concentration of receptors for rLH in testicular tissue, and surface densities of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes in Leydig cells, were similar in flight and simulated-launch rats. However, concentrations of testosterone in testicular tissue or peripheral blood plasma were reduced (P less than 0.05) in flight rats to less than 20 percent of values for simulated-launch or vivarium controls. Thus, spermatogenesis was essentially normal in flight rats, but production of testosterone was severely depressed. Sequela of reduced androgen production on turnover of muscle and bone should be considered when interpreting data from mammals exposed to microgravity.","[{""submissionId"":19960028990,""id"":""a326e8da57714a69814ccdd48dc320c9"",""publicationName"":""US Experiments Flown on the Soviet Biosatellite Cosmos 2044"",""publicationDate"":""1994-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NCC2-12"",""NAG2-597"",""NAGw-1579"",""NIH-G12-RR-03059-01A1"",""NAG2-613"",""NAG2-612"",""NCC2-455"",""NGT-50315""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19960028990

In an effort to understand the mechanisms of these changes, cell cultures of cartilage, bone and muscle have been subjected to spaceflight to study the microgravity effects on differentiated cells. However it now seems possible that the cell differentiation process itself may be the event(s) most affected by spaceflight. For example, osteoblast-like cells have been shown to have reduced cellular activity in microgravity due to an underdifferentiated state (Carmeliet, et al, 1997). And reduced human lymphocyte growth in spaceflight was related to increased apoptosis (Lewis, et al, 1998). Which brings us to the question of whether reduced cellular activity in space is due to an effect on the differentiated cell, an effect on the cell cycle and cell proliferation, or an effect on cell death. This question has not been specifically addressed on previous flights and was the question behind die present study.","[{""submissionId"":20000021584,""id"":""e292221113664ae9bd6c7e20f9f1fe2a"",""publicationDate"":""2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG2-1184""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000021584

V.""]","NASA in its plans to send humans to distant destination such as Mars faces the health and physiological performance problems caused by microgravity and space radiation. While most of the environmental conditions in spacecraft during flight can be made to mimic terrestrial conditions, microgravity cannot yet be managed. This space environmental factor has a major impact on the body’s biological system forcing alterations, in order to adapt to this new environment. Most space flight and ground-based studies suggest that prolonged exposure to microgravity leads to significant skeletal muscle atrophy, bone loss, and results in suppression of total metabolism. Due to microgravity, unloaded crewmembers lose up to 1.5% of their skeletal mass and 1.8% of bone strength each month during ISS missions. Remarkably many animals, including human-size bears, which are largely inactive during the 6 to 8 months of hibernation, show no loss in bone mass and much less muscle atrophy than would be anticipated over such a prolonged period of physical inactivity. This suggests that while in a suppressed metabolic state animals have unique natural mechanisms to prevent muscle disuse and bone atrophy. The molecular mechanisms underlying these important adaptations are not yet known. Radiation exposure is the second health hazard encountered during spaceflight that can cause radiation sickness, cancer or death. This study provides new evidence that metabolic activity levels play a critical role in radioprotection. Metabolic suppression, as an adaptive response of cells to minimize damage caused by radiation, enables cells to reduce cellular dysfunction and damage, and prolong their survival despite persistent oxidative stress. Thus mechanistic understanding of metabolism offers a means for sustaining astronauts in long-duration missions. The ultimate goals of this study are to demonstrate that induced metabolic suppression in animals and humans will profoundly reduce their sensitivity to the damaging effects of radiation and microgravity as well as other kinds of stresses caused by spaceflight. The beneficial effects of suppressed metabolism induced by different factors such as temperature, nutrition, and medications, will not only mitigate the most detrimental hazards of spaceflight but also radically reduce mission life support requirements and spaceflight logistics.","[{""submissionId"":20190001124,""id"":""42ad386eaa1845e7829d2b386f34cac7"",""publicationDate"":""2015-01-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190001124,""endDate"":""2015-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""532c631adef14b02a29dc8fbc6c0dde2"",""id"":""f6766988dd7c4903bffe4ee219361e39""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""532c631adef14b02a29dc8fbc6c0dde2"",""startDate"":""2015-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190001124

The MyoMonitor uses a two-bar single differential electrode. Due to the electrode-skin interface in traditional EMG equipment, during rigorous muscular activity, the movement of the skin causes the electrode detection surfaces to become compromised. The MyoMonitor eliminates this problem, enabling a wide array of applications and experiments during intense muscular activity.

L.""]","Treadmill locomotion exercise is an important aspect of ISS exercise countermeasures. It is widely believed that an optimized treadmill exercise protocol could offer benefits to cardiovascular and bone health. If training heart rate is high enough, treadmill exercise is expected to lead to improvements in aerobic fitness. If impact or bone loading forces are high enough, treadmill exercise may be expected to contribute to improved bone outcomes. Ground-based research suggests that joint loads increase with increased running speed. However, it is unknown if increases in locomotion speed results in similar increases in joint loads in microgravity. Although data exist regarding the biomechanics of running and walking in microgravity, a majority were collected during parabolic flight or during investigations utilizing a microgravity analog. The Second Generation Treadmill (T2) has been in use on the International Space Station (ISS) and records the ground reaction forces (GRF) produced by crewmembers during exercise. Biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in typical gait motion and allow for modeling of the human body to determine joint and muscle forces during exercise. By understanding these mechanisms, more appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies. The objective of this evaluation is to collect biomechanical data from crewmembers during treadmill exercise prior to and during flight. The goal is to determine if locomotive biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of subject load and speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise. Further, the data will be used to characterize any differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in these two gravitational conditions.

PURPOSE: This study characterized iRED training responses in a 1-g environment by: 1) determining whether 16 wk of high-intensity training with iRED produces increases in muscle strength and volume and bone mineral density (BMD), 2) comparing training responses with iRED to free weights, and 3) comparing iRED training responses at two training volumes. METHODS: Twenty-eight untrained men were assigned to four groups of seven subjects each: a no exercise control group (CON), an iRED group who trained with three sets/exercise (iRED3), a free-weight group (FW) who trained with three sets/exercise, and an iRED group who trained with six sets/exercise (iRED6). Training exercises included squat (SQ), heel raise (HR), and dead lift (DL) exercises, 3 d.wk(-1) for 16 wk. RESULTS: For CON, no changes occurred pre- to posttraining. For iRED3, increases (P< or =0.05) in one-repetition maximum (1-RM) strength (SQ 21 +/- 4%, HR 17 +/- 4%, DL 29 +/- 5%), leg lean mass (3.1 +/- 0.5%) by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and thigh (4.5 +/- 0.9%) and calf (5.9 +/- 0.7%) muscle volume (by magnetic resonance imaging) occurred after training with no changes in BMD (DXA). For FW, increases in 1-RM strength (SQ 22 +/- 5%, HR 24 +/- 3%, DL 41 +/- 7%), whole body (3.0 +/- 1.1%) and leg lean mass (5.4 +/- 1.2%), thigh (9.2 +/- 1.3%) and calf (4.2 +/- 1.0%) muscle volumes, and lumbar BMD (4.2 +/- 0.7%) occurred after training.

20040073493,OTHER,Cell Science and Cell Biology Research at MSFC: Summary,undefined,"The common theme of these research programs is that they investigate regulation of gene expression in cells, and ultimately gene expression is controlled by the macromolecular interactions between regulatory proteins and DNA. The NASA Critical Path Roadmap identifies Muscle Alterations and Atrophy and Radiation Effects as Very Serious Risks and Severe Risks, respectively, in long term space flights. The specific problem addressed by Dr. Young's research (""Skeletal Muscle Atrophy and Muscle Cell Signaling"") is that skeletal muscle loss in space cannot be prevented by vigorous exercise. Aerobic skeletal muscles (i.e., red muscles) undergo the most extensive atrophy during long-term space flight. Of the many different potential avenues for preventing muscle atrophy, Dr. Young has chosen to study the beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) pathway. The reason for this choice is that a family of compounds called betaAR agonists will preferentially cause an increase in muscle mass of aerobic muscles (i.e., red muscle) in animals, potentially providing a specific pharmacological solution to muscle loss in microgravity. In addition, muscle atrophy is a widespread medical problem in neuromuscular diseases, spinal cord injury, lack of exercise, aging, and any disease requiring prolonged bedridden status. Skeletal muscle cells in cell culture are utilized as a model system to study this problem. Dr. Richmond's research (""Radiation & Cancer Biology of Mammary Cells in Culture"") is directed toward developing a laboratory model for use in risk assessment of cancer caused by space radiation. This research is unique because a human model will be developed utilizing human mammary cells that are highly susceptible to tumor development. This approach is preferential over using animal cells because of problems in comparing radiation-induced cancers between humans and animals.","[{""submissionId"":20040073493,""id"":""de9ba2cdae444866b315907683de6f75"",""publicationName"":""Biological and Physical Space Research Laboratory 2002 Science Review"",""publicationDate"":""2003-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20040073490,""title"":""Biological and Physical Space Research Laboratory 2002 Science Review""},{""id"":20040073490,""title"":""Biological and Physical Space Research Laboratory 2002 Science Review""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040073493

20100037232,ABSTRACT,A Ground-Based Comparison of the Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System (MARES) and a Standard Isokinetic Dynamometer,"[""Hackney, K. J."",""English, K. L."",""Redd, E."",""DeWitt, J. K."",""Ploutz-Snyder, R."",""Ploutz-Snyder, L. L.""]","PURPOSE: 1) To compare the test-to-test reliability of Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System (MARES) with a standard laboratory isokinetic dynamometer (ISOK DYN) and; 2) to determine if measures of peak torque and total work differ between devices. METHODS: Ten subjects (6M, 4F) completed two trials on both MARES and an ISOK DYN in a counterbalanced order. Peak torque values at 60 deg & 180 deg / s were obtained from five maximal repetitions of knee extension (KE) and knee flexion (KF). Total work at 180 deg / s was determined from the area under the torque vs. displacement curve during twenty maximal repetitions of KE and KF. Reliability of measures within devices was interpreted from the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and compared between devices using the ratio of the within-device standard deviations. Indicators of agreement for the two devices were evaluated from: 1) a calculation of concordance (rho) and; 2) the correlation between the mean of measures versus the delta difference between measures (m u vs delta). RESULTS: For all outcome measures ICCs were high for both the ISOK DYN (0.95-0.99) and MARES (0.90-0.99). However, ratios of the within-device standard deviation were 1.3 to 4.3 times higher on MARES. On average, a wide range (3.3 to 1054 Nm) of differences existed between the values obtained. Only KE peak torque measured at 60 deg & 180 deg / s showed similarities between devices (rho = 0.91 & 0.87; Pearson's r for m u vs delta = -0.22 & -0.37, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although MARES was designed for use in microgravity it was quite reliable during ground-based testing. However, MARES was consistently more variable than an ISOK DYN. Future longitudinal studies evaluating a change in isokinetic peak torque or total work should be limited within one device.","[{""submissionId"":20100037232,""id"":""698556dc9cb34cd7a1a7382024672db0"",""publicationDate"":""2010-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20100037232,""endDate"":""2011-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""18th IAA Humans in Space Symposium"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""080df76491264adba5f6efd0be461678"",""startDate"":""2011-04-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100037232

The purpose of the exercise device is to work various muscle groups of the astronaut to prevent muscle atrophy, the loss of muscle strength and mass from prolonged exposure to a microgravity environment. The measurement part of the machine will be used to collect data on the strength and power of the astronaut's muscle groups to be used in studies examining the effects of prolonged space inhabitation. The principle device used in this machine to both exercise and measure muscle performance is the dynamometer. The dynamometer converts electrical energy to mechanical energy and mechanical energy to electrical energy or signals. The task of the designer will be to incorporate a dynamometer into a device which can meet all of the needs discussed above. This memorandum has two sections which clarify the design task of producing a full-body dynamometer. The first section is a specification list.

Previous HDS experiments with rats have shown an impaired capacity to perform aerobic exercise as demonstrated by reductions in maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max), treadmill run time (RT), and mechanical efficiency (ME) of treadmill running at submaximal conditions. To determine whether endurance training (TR) before HDS would modify exercise performance, male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to nontrained (NT) or TR groups for 6 wk and exposed to HDS or cage control (CC) conditions for 29 days. The rats were tested for VO2 max, RT, and ME before treatment and on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. In addition, water and electrolyte excretion was measured on days 1 and 21 of the experimental period. Before HDS, the TR rats had significantly higher measures of VO2 max (15%) and RT (22%) than the NT rats. On day 28, HDS was associated with significant reductions in absolute VO2 max (ml/min) in TR (-30%) and NT (-14%) rats. Relative VO2 max (ml.min-1.kg-1) was significantly reduced in TR (-15%) but not NT rats. Similar reductions in RT occurred in TR (-37%) and NT (-35%) rats by day 28. ME was reduced 22% in both TR and NT rats after 28 days of suspension. HDS elicited diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis in TR rats after 21 days but not after 24 h.

Valsalva straining provokes a stereotyped succession of alternating positive and negative arterial pressure and heart rate changes mediated in part by arterial baroreceptors. Arterial pressure changes result primarily from fluctuating levels of venous return to the heart and changes of sympathetic nerve activity. Muscle sympathetic activity was measured directly in nine volunteers to explore quantitatively the relation between arterial pressure and human sympathetic outflow during pressure transients provoked by controlled graded Valsalva maneuvers. Our results underscore several properties of sympathetic regulation during Valsalva straining. First, muscle sympathetic nerve activity changes as a mirror image of changes in arterial pressure. Second, the magnitude of sympathetic augmentation during Valsalva straining predicts phase 4 arterial pressure elevations. Third, post-Valsalva sympathetic inhibition persists beyond the return of arterial and right atrial pressures to baseline levels which reflects an alteration of the normal relation between arterial pressure and muscle sympathetic activity. Therefore, Valsalva straining may have some utility for investigating changes of reflex control of sympathetic activity after space flight; however, measurement of beat-to-beat arterial pressure is essential for this use. The utility of this technique in microgravity can not be determined from these data. Further investigations are necessary to determine whether these relations are affected by the expansion of intrathoracic blood volume associated with microgravity.","[{""submissionId"":19940007528,""id"":""01787558d9954cdc8fd3310d8fedd191"",""publicationName"":""Krug Life Sciences, Inc., Proceedings of the First Joint NASA Cardiopulmonary Workshop"",""publicationDate"":""1991-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940007528
20050000371,REPRINT,Temporal changes in sarcomere lesions of rat adductor longus muscles during hindlimb reloading,"[""Krippendorf, B. B."",""Riley, D. A.""]","Focal sarcomere disruptions were previously observed in adductor longus muscles of rats flown approximately two weeks aboard the Cosmos 1887 and 2044 biosatellite flights. These lesions, characterized by breakage and loss of myofilaments and Z-line streaming, resembled damage induced by unaccustomed exercise that includes eccentric contractions in which muscles lengthen as they develop tension. We hypothesized that sarcomere lesions in atrophied muscles of space flow rats were not produced in microgravity by muscle unloading but resulted from muscle reloading upon re-exposure to terrestrial gravity. To test this hypothesis, we examined temporal changes in sarcomere integrity of adductor longus muscles from rats subjected to 12.5 days of hindlimb suspension unloading and subsequent reloading by return to vivarium cages for 0, 6, 12, or 48 hours of normal weightbearing. Our ultrastructural observations suggested that muscle unloading (0 h reloading) induced myofibril misalignment associated with myofiber atrophy. Muscle reloading for 6 hours induced focal sarcomere lesions in which cross striations were abnormally widened. Such lesions were electron lucent due to extensive myofilament loss. Lesions in reloaded muscles showed rapid restructuring. By 12 hours of reloading, lesions were moderately stained foci and by 48 hours darkly stained foci in which the pattern of cross striations was indistinct at the light and electron microscopic levels. These lesions were spanned by Z-line-like electron dense filamentous material. Our findings suggest a new role for Z-line streaming in lesion restructuring: rather than an antecedent to damage, this type of Z-line streaming may be indicative of rapid, early sarcomere repair.","[{""volume"":""238"",""submissionId"":20050000371,""issue"":""3"",""issn"":""0003-276X"",""id"":""fc6b738c559f418e901b2b7f3d278ff6"",""publicationName"":""The Anatomical record"",""publicationDate"":""1994-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050000371

Globus"",""Candice GT Tahimic""]","Space flight presents unique risks to human health. Microgravity and social isolation are important space flight stressors which have vast impact on multiple systems such as the musculoskeletal, immune and central nervous system (CNS). To explore candidate countermeasures against tissue decrements caused by spaceflight, we performed a pilot study with PLacental-eXpanded stromal (PLX) cells. PLX cells secrete factors that modulate the immune system, but do not trigger host immune responses, enabling treatment in subjects that have intact immune systems. These cells had previous success in treating critical limb ischemia and acute radiation syndrome in murine models. In this study, 4-month-old female mice underwent 30 days of hindlimb unloading (HU) in single housing conditions to simulate long-term weightlessness and isolation. HU and normally ambulating controls were administered with PLX cells or sham-injected with Plasmalyte. We hypothesized that administration of PLX cells will mitigate some of the effects caused by prolonged HU. We found that treatment with PLX cells was well tolerated as indicated by body weights, circulating corticosterone levels and immune organ response to injection of the cells. HU led to the expected decreases in soleus muscle weights and bone loss. We did not observe any protective properties of the PLX cells in the musculoskeletal system but found that the cell treatment partially protected from a subset of HU-induced immune and CNS changes. In the hippocampus, protein levels of 9 of 44 cytokines were downregulated by HU. PLX administration mitigated changes in expression of 8 of these cytokines, including IL-2, IL-6 and MCP-1.

Our findings warrant further studies, which includes testing in actual spaceflight.

Advancement in alleviating ground diseases such as muscle atrophy and osteoporosis can come from the study of similar conditions that are known to occur as a result of exposure to the spaceflight environment. During the completion of the flight phase of two missions, our practices, hardware and operations evolved from tested to developed standards, which successfully translated the studies from ground to space. Results from these studies contribute to the science community via both the primary investigation and banked samples that are shared in publicly available data repository such as GeneLab. Every completed mission sets a foundation to build and design greater complexity into future research and answer questions about common human diseases on ground and in space.

C.""]","Because resistance exercise (REX) and unloading induce opposing neuromuscular adaptations, we tested the efficacy of REX against the effects of 14 d of bed rest unloading (BRU) on the plantar flexor muscle group. Sixteen men were randomly assigned to no exercise (NOE, N = 8) or REX (N = 8). REX performed 5 sets x 6-10 repetitions to failure of constant resistance concentric/eccentric plantar flexion every other day during BRU. One-repetition maximum (1RM) strength was tested on the training device. The angle-specific torque-velocity relationship across 5 velocities (0, 0.52, 1.05, 1.75, and 2.97 rad.s-1) and the full range-of-motion power-velocity relationship were assessed on a dynamometer. Torque-position analyses identified strength changes at shortened, neutral, and stretched muscle lengths. Concentric and eccentric contractile work were measured across ten repetitions at 1.05 rad.s-1. Maximal neural activation was measured by surface electromyography (EMG). 1RM decreased 9% in NOE and improved 11% in REX (P < 0.05). Concentric (0.52 and 1.05 rad.s-1), eccentric (0.52 and 2.97 rad.s-1), and isometric angle-specific torques decreased (P < 0.05) in NOE, averaging 18%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. Power dropped (P < 0.05) in NOE at three eccentric (21%) and two concentric (14%) velocities. REX protected angle-specific torque and average power at all velocities. Concentric and eccentric strength decreased at stretched (16%) and neutral (17%) muscle lengths (P < 0.05) in NOE while REX maintained or improved strength at all joint positions. Concentric (15%) and eccentric (11%) contractile work fell in NOE (P < 0.05) but not in REX. Maximal plantar flexor EMG did not change in either group. In summary, constant resistance concentric/eccentric REX completely prevented plantar flexor performance deconditioning induced by BRU. The reported benefits of REX should prove useful in prescribing exercise for astronauts in microgravity and for patients susceptible to functional decline during bed- or chair-bound hospital stays.","[{""volume"":""29"",""submissionId"":20040172839,""issue"":""11"",""issn"":""0195-9131"",""id"":""2cab1e94b67e4b8584670c6680f311c0"",""publicationName"":""Medicine and science in sports and exercise"",""publicationDate"":""1997-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""M01 RR00073""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040172839

Astronauts on the International Space Station perform regular resistance exercise using the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED). Squat exercises on Earth entail moving a portion of the body weight plus the added bar load, whereas in microgravity the body weight is 0, so all load must be applied via the bar. Crewmembers exercising in microgravity currently add approx.70% of their body weight to the bar load as compensation for the absence of the body weight. This level of body weight replacement (BWR) was determined by crewmember feedback and personal experience without any quantitative data. The purpose of this evaluation was to utilize computational simulation to determine the appropriate level of BWR in microgravity necessary to replicate lower extremity joint work during squat exercise in normal gravity based on joint work.

20200002192,PRESENTATION,Circulating miRNA Signature Predicts Health Risks Associated with Cancer and Spaceflight,"[""Beheshti, Afshin""]","Biological risks associated with space radiation and microgravity are major concerns for long-term space travel. Through a Systems Biology approach, our previous NASA work has shown both TGF signaling pathways and miRNAs have a critical impact on defining health risks with and without space irradiation. We hypothesize that circulating microRNA (miRNA) signatures are driving microvascular disease and muscle degeneration associated with accelerating aging and will be enhanced by exposure to the space environment (radiation and microgravity). We are investigating this hypothesis with both in vivo and in vitro models to test novel antagonist therapies to these miRNA signatures as countermeasures to reduce space radiation-induced health risks. A comprehensive Systems Biology approach is utilized to examine the influence by high atomic number by high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) irradiation. To simulate low-dose exposure due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR), we used ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula of 7 different ions to represent GCR (referred to as GCR sim model). To similate high-dose radiation exposure due to solar particle events (SPE), we used a solar particle event (SPE) sim model which gave a total dose of 1Gy protons with energy ranges from 50MeV to 150MeV. C57BL/6 wild-type female mice were utilized for the irradiations with our established simulated microgravity model (hindlimb suspension model) and an in vitro 3D microvasculature tissue model under simulated microgravity (clinostat) conditions was also irradiated. To expand on the circulating miRNA signature determined from our preliminary data, we determined a group of conserved miRNAs which are commonly being regulated in the majority of the organs and tissues throughout the host using our established techniques. MiRNA-sequencing was done on serum (at time of sacrifice), liver, heart, and muscle (soleus muscle) tissue for all radiation groups. Additional validation of the key miRNAs was performed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). This revealed a key circulating miRNA signature (consisting of multiple miRNAs) impacting cardiovascular and muscular disease risk. Further in vitro experiments with CRISPR/Cas9 system to knockout the key miRNA signatures, novel self-delivering antagomirs, overexpression of the miRNAs test the functional impact of the miRNA signatures on both microvascular disease and muscle degeneration due to space irradiation. The current work has started to allow the possible development of a novel minimally invasive miRNA based radioprotector to be used as a countermeasure for space radiation. Collectively, understanding of how whole body space radiation impacts microvascular and tissue degeneration through circulating miRNAs will greatly enhance health risk prognostication and provide possible new mechanisms for protection against space radiation.

S.""]","Muscles of the hindlimb in the rat have been used to demonstrate the effects of unloading in weightlessness and in animal models used to mimic weightlessness. The vastus medialis (VM) is discussed here. Samples were obtained from rats exposed to weightlessness for 12 days in Cosmos 1887 (Experiment K-6-08, coordinated by Dr. V.S. Oganov). The principal objective of this study was to ascertain if the vastus medialis responded to 12 days of microgravity exposure. The loss in muscle mass is greatest, -43 percent, when comparing F vs B, and least, -13 percent, when comparing F vs. V. Taken at face value these differences may be misleading. Due to the variability of the muscle weight in the basal group, these muscle mass losses may be exaggerated. In terms of percent water, there were no differences between the flight and the control groups. In spite of the limited sample, researchers conclude that muscle mass changes in the VM are not significant. Although some of the morphological parameters suggest a small degree of atrophy in the vastus medialis, the biochemical analyses (protein, RNA and DNA) suggest that these may be minimal and functionally nonsignificant. The relatively similar CS and LDH activities of VM from F and various control groups, as well as the lack of difference in LPL activity between F and S rats, suggests that there is little or no effect on the oxidative or glycolytic function of this muscle. Since the VM is chiefly a mixed fast twitch muscle, these metabolic indices of energy production are relatively unchanged. The results of VM studies are in agreement with previous observations of another type II fast twitch muscle, the EDL, from SL-3 rats which did not respond markedly to weightlessness and whole body suspension.","[{""submissionId"":19900017146,""id"":""77ec5ad3921944f091fe0f19e449e83b"",""publicationName"":""NASA, Ames Research Center, The US Experiments Flown on the Soviet Biosatellite Cosmos 1887"",""publicationDate"":""1990-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19900017146
20210019591,CONFERENCE_PAPER,The Partial Gravity of the Moon and Mars Appears Insufficient to Maintain Human Health,"[""Harry W. Jones""]","Astronauts who spend many weeks or months in space in microgravity suffer serious
health problems including muscle atrophy, cardiovascular deconditioning, bone calcium loss,
impaired vision, and immune system changes. The debilitating effects of weightlessness were
first demonstrated on the early Skylab, Salyut, and Mir missions, but it was then hoped that
countermeasures including in-flight exercise and resistance training could reduce most of
these problems. Similar effects are anticipated in the partial gravity of the Moon and Mars.
Direct evidence of the long-term effects of partial gravity on humans is not yet available, but
indirect evidence suggests that partial gravity exposure below 0.4 g will be insufficient to
maintain musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary conditioning over the long term. Some studies
show a strong correlation between heart rate, oxygen consumption, net metabolic rate, and
simulated gravity from 0 to 1 g. Exposure to moon and Mars gravities will probably cause less
severe physiological deconditioning than microgravity, but the benefit of partial gravity seems

Significant changes in bone and muscle have been shown after long term space flight. Similar changes have been demonstrated due to bed rest. Bone demineralization is particularly profound in weight bearing bones. Much of the current techniques to monitor bone condition use bone mass measurements. However, bone mass measurements are not reliable to distinguish Osteoporotic and Normal subjects. It has been shown that the overlap between normals and osteoporosis is found for all of the bone mass measurement technologies: single and dual photon absorptiometry, quantitative computed tomography and direct measurement of bone area/volume on biopsy as well as radiogrammetry. A similar discordance is noted in the fact that it has not been regularly possible to find the expected correlation between severity of osteoporosis and degree of bone loss. Structural parameters such as trabecular connectivity have been proposed as features for assessing bone conditions. In this report, we use fractal analysis to characterize bone structure. We show that the fractal dimension computed with MRI images and X-Ray images of the patella are the same. Preliminary experimental results show that the fractal dimension computed from MRI images of vertebrae of human subjects before bedrest is higher than during bedrest.","[{""submissionId"":19950025998,""id"":""b4bb912af4eb4e45bf1bb8f71247a6dc"",""publicationName"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Summer Faculty Fellowship Program, 1994, Volume 1 15 p (SEE N95-32418 12-99)"",""publicationDate"":""1995-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":19950025898,""title"":""The 26th Annual Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) Applications and Planning Meeting""},{""id"":19950025898,""title"":""The 26th Annual Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) Applications and Planning Meeting""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19950025998

Artificial gravity (AG) paradigms may offer multisystem protection from the untoward effects of adaptation to the microgravity of space or the hypogravity of planetary surfaces. While the most effective AG designs would employ a rotating spacecraft, perceived issues may preclude their use. The questions of whether and how intermittent AG produced by a short radius centrifuge (SRC) could be employed have therefore sprung to the forefront of operational research.

In the 1887 experiment two issues were considered especially important. First, it was recognized that cells prepared from individual rat pituitary glands should be considered separately so that the data from the 5 glands could be analyzed in a statistically meaningful way. Second, results of the SL-3 flight involving the hollow fiber implant and HPLC GH-variant experiments suggested that the biological activity of the hormone had been negatively affected by flight. The results of the 1887 experiment documented the wisdom of addressing both issues in the protocol. Thus, the reduction in secretory capacity of flight cells during subsequent extended cell culture on Earth was documented statistically, and thereby established the validity of the SL-3 result. The results of both flight experiments thus support the contention that there is a secretory lesion in pituitary GH cells of flight animals. The primary objective of both missions was a clear definition of the effect of spaceflight on the GH cell system. There can no longer be any reasonable doubt that this system is affected in microgravity. One explanation for the reason(s) underlying the better known effects of spaceflight on organisms, viz. changes in bone, muscle and immune systems may very well rest with such changes in bGH. In spite of the fact that rats in the Cosmos 1887 flight were on Earth for two days after flight, the data show that the GH system had still not recovered from the effects of flight. Many questions remain. One of the more important concerns the GRF responsiveness of somatotrophs after flight. This will be tested in an upcoming experiment.","[{""submissionId"":19900017159,""id"":""daa3268918774d1291b44d2a3de4aa0b"",""publicationName"":""The US Experiments Flown on the Soviet Biosatellite Cosmos 1887"",""publicationDate"":""1990-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19900017159

E.""]","In order to minimize the loss of bone and muscle mass during spaceflight, the Multi-purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) will include an exercise device and enough free space within the cabin for astronauts to use the device effectively. The NASA Digital Astronaut Project (DAP) has been tasked with using computational modeling to aid in determining whether or not the available operational volume is sufficient for in-flight exercise.Motion capture data was acquired using a 12-camera Smart DX system (BTS Bioengineering, Brooklyn, NY), while exercisers performed 9 resistive exercises without volume restrictions in a 1g environment. Data were collected from two male subjects, one being in the 99th percentile of height and the other in the 50th percentile of height, using between 25 and 60 motion capture markers. Motion capture data was also recorded as a third subject, also near the 50th percentile in height, performed aerobic rowing during a parabolic flight. A motion capture system and algorithms developed previously and presented at last years HRP-IWS were utilized to collect and process the data from the parabolic flight [1]. These motions were applied to a scaled version of a biomechanical model within the biomechanical modeling software OpenSim [2], and the volume sweeps of the motions were visually assessed against an imported CAD model of the operational volume. Further numerical analysis was performed using Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) and the OpenSim API. This analysis determined the location of every marker in space over the duration of the exercise motion, and the distance of each marker to the nearest surface of the volume. Containment of the exercise motions within the operational volume was determined on a per-exercise and per-subject basis. The orientation of the exerciser and the angle of the footplate were two important factors upon which containment was dependent. Regions where the exercise motion exceeds the bounds of the operational volume have been identified by determining which markers from the motion capture exceed the operational volume and by how much. A credibility assessment of this analysis was performed in accordance with NASA-STD-7009 prior to delivery to the MPCV program.","[{""submissionId"":20170005224,""id"":""aff7bc787f46454bbe499d532c09d403"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20170005224,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst.

Both EMG and neurogram levels were increased when the gravity levels were elevated from 1-G to 2-G during the parabolic flight. They were decreased when the hindlimbs were unloaded by exposure to actual microgravity or by suspension. These phenomena were related to passive shortening of muscle fibers and/or sarcomeres. Unloading-related decrease in sarcomere length was greater at the central rather than the proximal and distal regions of fibers.

To combat spaceflight physiological deconditioning, astronauts will use resistive and aerobic exercise regimens for the duration of the space flight to minimize the loss of bone density, muscle mass and aerobic capacity that occurs during exposure to a reduced gravity environment. Unlike the International Space Station (ISS), the mass and volume available for an exercise device in the next generation of spacecraft is limited. Therefore, compact exercise device prototypes are being developed for human in the loop evaluations. The NASA Human Research Program (HRP) is managing Advanced Exercise Concepts (AEC) requirements development and candidate technology maturation for all exploration mission profiles from Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) exploration missions (e.g., EM-2, up to 21 day) to Mars Transit (up to 1000 day) missions. Numerous technologies have been considered and evaluated against HRP-approved functional requirements and include flywheel, pneumatic and closed-loop microprocessor-controlled motor driven power plants. Motor driven technologies offer excellent torque density and load accuracy characteristics as well as the ability to create custom mechanical impedance (the dynamic relationship between force and velocity) and custom load versus position exercise algorithms. Further, closed-loop motor-driven technologies offer the ability to monitor exercise dose parameters and adapt to the needs of the crewmember for real time optimization of exercise prescriptions. A simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is demonstrated in a prototype motor driven exercise device with comparison to resistive static and dynamic load set points and aerobic work rate targets. The resistive load term in the algorithm includes a constant force component (Fcmg) as well as inertial component (Fima) and a discussion of system tuning is presented in terms of addressing key functional requirements and human interfaces. The device aerobic modality is modelled as a rowing exercise using ground data sets obtained from Concept 2 rowers as well as competitive rowing1. A discussion of software and electronic implementations are presented which demonstrate unique approaches to meeting the constrained mass, volume and power requirements of the MPCV. . In addition to utilizing traditional PID control, controllers utilizing state feedback with gains solved using a Linear Quadratic Regulator will be developed. Controllability and observability will be utilized to investigate the need for state measurement in the design. As the control system directly interacts with human test subjects, robust methods such as H-infinity are also being investigated.1. Kleshnev V. Biomechanics.

One generalized response to a reduction in load is muscle fiber atrophy, although not all muscles respond the same. Our understanding of how muscles respond to microgravity, however, has come primarily from the examination of hindlimb muscles in the unrestrained rate in space. The non-human primate spaceflight paradigm differs considerably from the rodent paradigm in that the monkeys are restrained, usually in a sitting position, while in space. Recently, we examined the effects of microgravity on muscles of the Rhesus monkey by taking biopsies of selected hindlimb muscles prior to and following spaceflights of 14 and 12 day durations (Cosmos 2044 and 2229). Our results revealed that the monkey's response to microgravity differs from that of the rat. The apparent differences in the atrophic response of the hindlimb muscles of the monkey and rat to spaceflight may be attributed to the following: (1) a species difference; (2) a difference in the manner in which the animals were maintained during the flight (i.e., chair restraint or 'free-floating'); and/or (3) an ability of the monkeys to counteract the effects of spaceflight with resistive exercise.","[{""submissionId"":19960021692,""id"":""2dfb26265e364abbbcee319784492be4"",""publicationName"":""Journal of Gravitational Physiology, Volume 2, No. 1"",""publicationDate"":""1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG2-714"",""NAG2-653""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19960021692

Control of orientation, posture, and locomotion are functions of the vestibular system which are altered by changes in gravitational environment. Not only is the vestibular system involved with coordination and proprioception, but the gravity sensing portion of the vestibular system also plays a major role in maintaining muscle tone through projections to spinal cord motoneurons that control anti-gravity muscles. I have been involved with investigations of several aspects of the link between vestibular inputs and muscle morphology and function during my work with Dr. Nancy Daunton this summer and the previous summer. We have prepared a manuscript for submission (4) to Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine based on work that I performed last summer in Dr. Daunton's lab. Techniques developed for that project will be utilized in subsequent experiments begun in the summer of 1998.

The purpose of this project was to compare foot-ground reaction force during iRED exercise in normal gravity (1 G) vs. microgravity (0 G) achieved during parabolic flight. METHODS: There were four subjects who performed three exercises (squat, heel raise, and deadlift) using the iRED during 1 G and 0 G at a moderate intensity (60% of maximum strength during deadlift exercise). Foot-ground reaction force was measured in the three orthogonal axes (x, y, z) using a force plate, and the magnitude of the resultant force vector was calculated (r = square root(x2 + y2 + z2)). Linear displacement (LD) was measured using a linear transducer. Peak force (Fpeak) and an index of total work (TWi) were calculated using a customized computer program. Paired t-tests were used to test if significant differences (p < or = 0.05) were observed between 1 G and 0 G exercise. RESULTS: Fpeak and TWi measured in the resultant axis were significantly less in 0 G for each of the exercises tested. During 0 G, Fpeak was 42-46% and TWi was 33-37% of that measured during 1 G. LD and average time to complete each repetition were not different from 1 G to 0 G. CONCLUSIONS: Crewmembers who perform resistive exercises during spaceflight that include the movement of a large portion of their body mass will require much greater external resistive force during 0 G than 1 G exercise to provide a sufficient stimulus to maintain muscle and bone mass.","[{""volume"":""75"",""submissionId"":20050153307,""issue"":""5"",""issn"":""0095-6562"",""id"":""a478fe352b9047ab94b7ef4dcea29dfc"",""publicationName"":""Aviation, space, and environmental medicine"",""publicationDate"":""2004-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050153307

20140004048,ABSTRACT,A Case for Hypogravity Studies Aboard ISS,"[""Paloski, William H.""]","Future human space exploration missions being contemplated by NASA and other spacefaring nations include some that would require long stays upon bodies having gravity levels much lower than that of Earth. While we have been able to quantify the physiological effects of sustained exposure to microgravity during various spaceflight programs over the past half-century, there has been no opportunity to study the physiological adaptations to gravity levels between zero-g and one-g. We know now that the microgravity environment of spaceflight drives adaptive responses of the bone, muscle, cardiovascular, and sensorimotor systems, causing bone demineralization, muscle atrophy, reduced aerobic capacity, motion sickness, and malcoordination. All of these outcomes can affect crew health and performance, particularly after return to a one-g environment. An important question for physicians, scientists, and mission designers planning human exploration missions to Mars (3/8 g), the Moon (1/6 g), or asteroids (likely negligible g) is: What protection can be expected from gravitational levels between zero-g and one-g? Will crewmembers deconditioned by six months of microgravity exposure on their way to Mars experience continued deconditioning on the Martian surface? Or, will the 3/8 g be sufficient to arrest or even reverse these adaptive changes? The implications for countermeasure deployment, habitat accommodations, and mission design warrant further investigation into the physiological responses to hypogravity. It is not possible to fully simulate hypogravity exposure on Earth for other than transient episodes (e.g., parabolic flight). However, it would be possible to do so in low Earth orbit (LEO) using the centrifugal forces produced in a live-aboard centrifuge. As we're not likely to launch a rotating human spacecraft into LEO anytime in the near future, we could take advantage of rodent subjects aboard the ISS if we had a centrifuge that could accommodate the rodent subjects for extended periods (weeks to months) at various hypogravity levels. Experiments aboard such a centrifuge could provide important insight into human exploration questions and simultaneously answer fundamental questions in gravitational physiology.","[{""submissionId"":20140004048,""id"":""74ff425c9a0447aca45645652a3f8d07"",""publicationDate"":""2014-05-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140004048,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States"",""id"":""93ffbbeb45774a59bfe3f30a60b3ad3d""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140004048,""endDate"":""2014-05-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""ef67d12d294640c7a7d31a2705cc740e"",""id"":""7f523e2768034a849640bb3630b97b96""}],""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association 2014 Annual Meeting"",""location"":""San Diego, CA"",""id"":""ef67d12d294640c7a7d31a2705cc740e"",""startDate"":""2014-05-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140004048

Atrophy most likely results from changes at both the systemic level (e.g. decreased circulating growth hormone, increased circulating glucocorticoids) and locally (e.g. decreased myofiber resting tension). Differentiated skeletal myofibers in tissue culture have provided a model system over the last decade for gaining a better understanding of the interactions of exogenous growth factors, endogenous growth factors, and muscle fiber tension in regulating protein turnover rates and muscle cell growth. Tissue engineering these cells into three dimensional bioartificial muscle (BAM) constructs has allowed us to extend their use to Space flight studies for the potential future development of countermeasures. Embryonic avian muscle cells were isolated and BAMs tissue engineered as described previously. The myoblasts proliferate and fuse into aligned postmitotic myofibers after ten to fourteen days in vitro. A cylindrical muscle-like structure containing several thousand myofibers is formed which is approximately 30 mm in length, 2-3 mm in diameter, and attached at each end. For the Space Shuttle experiments, the BAMs were transferred to 55 mL bioreactor cartridges (6 BAMs/cartridge). At Kennedy Space Center, the cartridges were mounted in two Space Tissue Loss (STL) Modules (three to four cartridges per Module) and either maintained as ground controls or loaded in a Mid-Deck locker of the Space Shuttle. The BAM cartridges were continuously perfused during the experiment at 1.5 mL/ min with tissue culture medium. Eighteen BAMs were flown for nine days on Mission STS66 while eighteen BAMs served as ground controls. The complete experiment was repeated on Mission STS77 with twenty four BAMs in each group. BAMs could be maintained in a healthy state for at least 30 days in the perfusion bioreactor cartridges. The BAM muscle fibers directly detected both the loss of gravity and the reloading effects of 1 x g. While total cellular metabolism and total protein degradation rates were not altered during 9 to 10 days in Space, protein synthesis rates were significantly reduced and resulted in significant myofiber atrophy compared to ground controls. One g reloading of the flight muscle cells post-flight significantly increased protein synthesis rates and the synthesis rates of myosin heavy chain, fibronectin, and collagen. Tissue cultured muscle cells can directly ""sense"" changes in gravity and provide a valid model to begin the study of countermeasures. Based on our ground based experiments, and the experiments of others, growth hormone and/or insulin-like growth factors are attractive protein therapeutics which may assisting attenuating skeletal muscle wasting in space. Our laboratory is developing a new cell-based delivery system for this and other potential therapeutic factors for attenuating muscle and bone wasting.","[{""submissionId"":19990089312,""id"":""651ed25bb8514fe09111efd6df45718b"",""publicationName"":""Cells in Spaceflight: Past, Present and Future"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG2-1205"",""NAG2-914""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":19990089307,""title"":""Cells in Spaceflight: Past, Present and Future""},{""id"":19990089307,""title"":""Cells in Spaceflight: Past, Present and Future""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19990089312
20100039445,ABSTRACT,Stretch Reflex as a Simple Measure to Evaluate the Efficacy of Potential Flight Countermeasures Using the Bed Rest Environment,"[""Cerisano, J. M."",""Reschke, M. F."",""Kofman, I. S."",""Fisher, E. A."",""Harm, D. L.""]","INTRODUCTION: Spaceflight is acknowledged to have significant effects on the major postural muscles. However, it has been difficult to separate the effects of ascending somatosensory changes caused by the unloading of these muscles during flight from changes in sensorimotor function caused by a descending vestibulo-cerebellar response to microgravity. It is hypothesized that bed rest is an adequate model to investigate postural muscle unloading given that spaceflight and bed rest may produce similar results in both nerve axon and muscle tissue. METHODS: To investigate this hypothesis, stretch reflexes were measured on 18 subjects who spent 60 to 90 days in continuous 6 head-down bed rest. Using a motorized system capable of rotating the foot around the ankle joint (dorsiflexion) through an angle of 10 deg at a peak velocity of approximately 250 deg/sec, a stretch reflex was recorded from the subject's left triceps surae muscle group. Using surface electromyography, about 300 reflex responses were obtained and ensemble-averaged on 3 separate days before bed rest, 3 to 4 times in bed, and 3 times after bed rest. The averaged responses for each test day were examined for reflex latency and conduction velocity (CV) across gender and compared with spaceflight data. RESULTS: Although no gender differences were found, bed rest induced changes in reflex latency and CV similar to the ones observed during spaceflight. Also, a relationship between CV and loss of muscle strength in the lower leg was observed for most bed rest subjects. CONCLUSION: Even though bed rest (limb unloading) alone may not mimic all of the synaptic and muscle tissue loss that is observed as a result of spaceflight, it can serve as a working analog of flight for the evaluation of potential countermeasures that may be beneficial in mitigating unwanted changes in the major postural muscles that are observed post flight.","[{""submissionId"":20100039445,""id"":""5bba8ba1131845cd8efdc5468c4b3997"",""publicationDate"":""2010-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20100039445,""endDate"":""2011-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""18th IAA Humans in Space Symposium"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""aa1eaad91071486d836a3a2d6b16a6b3"",""startDate"":""2011-04-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100039445

Compared to upright-seated posture, 0 deg. supine, 6 deg. HDT, and 15 deg. HDT produced TMD changes of 317 +/- 112, 403 +/- 114, and 474 +/- 112 n1 (means +/- S.E.), respectively. Furthermore, postural transitions from 0 deg. supine to 6 deg. HDT and from 6 deg. to 15 deg. HDT generated significant TMD changes (p less than 0.05). There was no hysteresis when postural transitions to HDT were compared to reciprocal transitions toward upright seated posture. Currently, diagnosis of chronic compartment syndrome (CCS) depends on measurement of intramuscular pressure by invasive catheterization. We hypothesized that this syndrome can be detected noninvasively by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, which tracks variations in muscle hemoglobin/myoglobin oxygen saturation. CCS was simulated in the tibialis anterior muscle of 7 male and 3 female subjects by gradual inflation of a cuff placed around the leg to 40 mmHg during 14 minutes of cyclic isokinetic dorsiflexion exercise. On a separate day, subjects underwent the identical exercise protocol with no external compression. In both cases, tissue oxygenation (T(sub O2) was measured in the tibialis anterior by NIR spectroscopy and normalized to a percentage scale between baseline and a T(sub O2) nadir reached during exercise to ischemic exhaustion. Over the course of exercise, T(sub O2) declined at a rate of 1.4 +/- 0.3% per minute with model CCS, yet did not decrease during control exercise. Post-exercise recovery of T(sub O2) was slower with model CCS (2.5 +/- 0.6 min) than in control (1.3 +/- 0.2 min). These results demonstrate that NIR spectroscopy can detect muscle deoxygenation caused by pathologically elevated intramuscular pressure in exercising skeletal muscle. Consequently, this technique shows promise as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for CCS.","[{""submissionId"":20020009559,""id"":""64e86c4258014b038d0c21a03f7419d8"",""publicationDate"":""1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20020009559,""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""d41b4d00d0364b2d8082d38ef4cdf920""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20020009559,""endDate"":""1995-04-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""97e0ba377e634220a021507ca9e98db7"",""id"":""f300360207d34ea8bd949285d9fea006""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""97e0ba377e634220a021507ca9e98db7"",""id"":""5c530ae64be140abb166ee7bcbb12729""}],""name"":""AIAA/NASA Life Sciences and Space Medicine Conference"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""97e0ba377e634220a021507ca9e98db7"",""startDate"":""1995-04-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""RTOP 199-14-12-04""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020009559

20020034615,ABSTRACT,Adaptation to Space: An Introduction,"[""Hargens, Alan R.""]","The cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems are normally exposed to gradients of blood pressure and weight on Earth. These gradients increase blood pressure and tissue weight in dependent tissues of the body. Exposure to actual and simulated microgravity causes blood and tissue fluid to shift from the legs to the head. Studies of humans in space have documented facial edema, space motion sickness, decreased plasma volume, muscle atrophy, and loss of bone strength. Return of astronauts to Earth is accompanied by orthostatic intolerance, decreased neuromuscular coordination, and reduced exercise capacity. These factors decrease performance during descent from orbit and increase risk during emergency egress from the spacecraft. Models of simulated microgravity include 6 deg head-down tilt, immersion, and prolonged horizontal bedrest. Head-down tilt is the most accepted model and studies using this model of up to one year have been performed in Russia. Animal models which offer clear insights into the role of gravity on vertebrates include the developing giraffe and snakes from various habitats. Finally, possible countermeasures to speed readaptation of astronauts to gravity after prolonged space flight will be discussed.","[{""submissionId"":20020034615,""id"":""788e107e6faf4e9ebfbe0bce1792b84a"",""publicationDate"":""1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""India"",""submissionId"":20020034615,""endDate"":""1995-12-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""76a92a0b20e348548f73b99940a32dca"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Society for Adapt.

20070028552,PREPRINT,Artificial Gravity: Will it Preserve Bone Health on Long-Duration Missions?,"[""Davis-Street, Janis"",""Paloski, William H.""]","Prolonged microgravity exposure disrupts bone, muscle, and cardiovascular homeostasis, sensory-motor coordination, immune function, and behavioral performance. Bone loss, in particular, remains a serious impediment to the success of exploration-class missions by increasing the risks of bone fracture and renal stone formation for crew members. Current countermeasures, consisting primarily of resistive and aerobic exercise, have not yet proven fully successful for preventing bone loss during long-duration spaceflight. While other bone-specific countermeasures, such as pharmacological therapy and dietary modifications, are under consideration, countermeasure approaches that simultaneously address multiple physiologic systems may be more desirable for exploration-class missions, particularly if they can provide effective protection at reduced mission resource requirements (up-mass, power, crew time, etc). The most robust of the multi-system approaches under consideration, artificial gravity (AG), could prevent all of the microgravity-related physiological changes from occurring. The potential methods for realizing an artificial gravity countermeasure are reviewed, as well as selected animal and human studies evaluating the effects of artificial gravity on bone function. Future plans for the study of the multi-system effects of artificial gravity include a joint, cooperative international effort that will systematically seek an optimal prescription for intermittent AG to preserve bone, muscle, and cardiovascular function in human subjects deconditioned by 6 degree head-down-tilt-bed rest. It is concluded that AG has great promise as a multi-system countermeasure, but that further research is required to determine the appropriate parameters for implementation of such a countermeasure for exploration-class missions.","[{""submissionId"":20070028552,""id"":""31485529373b4f83b0cc9463b48540c0"",""publicationDate"":""2005-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20070028552,""name"":""Cleveland Clinic Foundation"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH, United States"",""id"":""95ca9578eb914e6f834864f1216e9f1d""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20070028552,""endDate"":""2005-06-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Cleveland Clinic Foundation"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH, United States""}},""meetingId"":""25e298bd3de04dfbb575faf9c6eac7a4"",""id"":""3af3694cbbdb4c89bc296709405f2eac""}],""name"":""Bone Loss During Space Flight"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH"",""id"":""25e298bd3de04dfbb575faf9c6eac7a4"",""startDate"":""2005-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070028552
20040089769,REPRINT,Review of spaceflight and hindlimb suspension unloading induced sarcomere damage and repair,"[""Riley, D. A."",""Thompson, J. L."",""Krippendorf, B. B."",""Slocum, G. R.""]","Hindlimb suspension unloading (HSU) and spaceflight microgravity induce atrophy of the slow adductor longus muscle fibers which, following reloading, exhibit eccentric contraction (EC)-like lesions (abnormal widening of sarcomeres with A band disruption and excessively wavy, extracted Z lines).  These lesions are similar morphologically to those produced in normal muscles after strenuous eccentric exercise.  It appears that atrophic muscles exhibit increased susceptibility to eccentric damage because lesions are produced during  nonstressful voluntary movements upon return to weightbearing.  The EC-like lesions are absent in the unweighted conditions, but appear in HSU rats 15-60 minutes after reloading and in space-flown rates about 4 hrs after landing.  By 12 hours, many EC-like lesioned sarcomeres are fully covered by longitudinal patches of Z line-like material which increases in density by 48 hours, producing the so-called ""Z line streaming"" morphology.  In this case, Z line streaming is indicative of rapid repair of damaged sarcomeres rather than the onset of sarcomere breakdown.  Immunoelectron microscopy is necessary to determine the composition of this dense material.  By 9 days of reloading at 1 gravity, sarcomeres have regained normal structure, except for very rare persistence of faint Z patches.  The morphological data indicate that Z patches serve at least two functions:  1) to permit contractile force to be transmitted across the damaged sarcomeres and 2) to provide a scaffold upon which sarcomeres are reconstructed in an active functional muscle.","[{""volume"":""5"",""submissionId"":20040089769,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""1120-9992"",""id"":""98325ec549e2455895d10c117bed33c7"",""publicationName"":""Basic and applied myology :  BAM"",""publicationDate"":""1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG2-633"",""NAGW-70"",""NAG2-522""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089769

As the gravitational force increases or decreases, the cell function responds in a linear fashion. This poses significant health risks for astronauts in long-term spaceflight. The application of light therapy with the use of NASA LEDs will significantly improve the medical care that is available to astronauts on long-term space missions. NASA LEDs stimulate the basic energy processes in the mitochondria (energy compartments) of each cell, particularly when near-infrared light is used to activate the color sensitive chemicals (chromophores, cytochrome systems) inside. Optimal LED wavelengths include 680, 730 and 880 nm and our laboratory has improved the healing of wounds in laboratory animals by using both NASA LED light and hyperbaric oxygen. Furthermore, DNA synthesis in fibroblasts and muscle cells has been quintupled using NASA LED light alone, in a single application combining 680, 730 and 880 nm each at 4 Joules per centimeter squared. Muscle and bone atrophy are well documented in astronauts, and various minor injuries occurring in space have been reported not to heal until landing on Earth. An LED blanket device may be used for the prevention of bone and muscle atrophy in astronauts. The depth of near-infrared light penetration into human tissue has been measured spectroscopically.","[{""submissionId"":20030001599,""id"":""9dcd708bb204464093aa8f5a64160be3"",""publicationName"":""Second International Conference on Near-Field Optical Analysis: Photodynamic Therapy and Photobiology Effects"",""publicationDate"":""2002-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAS8-01166"",""NAS8-99015""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20030001592,""title"":""Second International Conference on Near-Field Optical Analysis: Photodynamic Therapy and Photobiology Effects""},{""id"":20030001592,""title"":""Second International Conference on Near-Field Optical Analysis: Photodynamic Therapy and Photobiology Effects""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20030001599
20040172725,REPRINT,"The bearable lightness of being: bones, muscles, and spaceflight","[""Johnson, R. B.""]","Bones and muscles support and move the body. Tendons link the two tissues and serve as a mechanism for transfer of forces from muscle to bone. These three tissues interact and respond to periods of activity or inactivity with appropriate alterations in structure and strength. There is substantial evidence that an environment devoid of mechanical stress on the skeleton (such as reduced gravitational forces during spaceflight, a ""microgravity environment"") produces direct effects on bone structure and function. There is little agreement concerning the biologic mechanisms for these atrophic changes. Changes in fluid balance and distribution coincident to spaceflight also affect muscles and bones by an unknown mechanism. Tendon-bone junctions are presumed to be spared from the effects of spaceflight. However, recent evidence from rodents suggests that spaceflight profoundly effects both the skeleton and the tendon-bone junctions. These effects include cortical bone resorption, which undermines the Sharpey's fibers that anchor the tendon to the bone matrix. The challenge to biomedical scientists is to devise methods for protecting spaceflight crews from these atrophic changes; such protection would allow for longer and more extensive spaceflights.","[{""volume"":""253"",""submissionId"":20040172725,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""0003-276X"",""id"":""d9b3757647c44dc3861b6c2e927bf35f"",""publicationName"":""The Anatomical record"",""publicationDate"":""1998-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040172725

20080012487,ABSTRACT,16 Weeks of Training with the International Space Station Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (aRED) Is not Different than Training with Free Weights,"[""Loehr, J. A."",""Lee, S. M. C."",""English, K. E."",""Leach, M."",""Bentley, J."",""Nash, R."",""Hagan, R. D.""]","The advanced Resistive Exercise Device (aRED) is a resistive exercise system designed to maintain muscle mass and strength in microgravity by simulating free weight (FW) exercise. aRED utilizes vacuum cylinders and inertial flywheels to replicate the constant mass and inertial components, respectively, of FW exercise in normal gravity. PURPOSE: To compare the effectiveness of aRED and FW resistive exercise training in ambulatory subjects. METHODS: Untrained subjects were assigned to two groups, FW (6 males, 3 females) and aRED (8 males, 3 females), and performed squat (SQ), heel raise (HR), and deadlift (DL) exercises 3 d wk-1 for 16 wks. SQ, HR and DL strength (1RM) were measured using FW hardware pre-, mid- and post-training. Subjects participated in a periodized training protocol with the exercise prescription based on a percentage of 1RM. Thigh and lower leg muscle volume were assessed using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and leg (LLM) and total body lean mass (BLM) were measured using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) pre- and post-training. RESULTS: SQ 1RM increased in both FW (48.9+/-6.1%) and aRED (31.2+/-3.8%) groups, and there was a greater training response in FW compared with aRED (p=0.01). HR and DL 1RM increased in FW (HR: 12.3+/-2.4%, DL: 23.3+/-4.4%) and aRED (HR: 18.0+/-1.6%, DL: 23.2+'-2.8%), but there were no differences between groups. Thigh muscle volume was greater following training in both groups (FW: 9.8+/-0.9%, aRED: 7.1+/-1.2%) but lower leg muscle volume increased only in the FW group (3.0+/-1.1%). Lean tissue mass increased in both FW (LLM: 3.9+/-1.1%, BLM: 2.5+/-0.7%) and aRED (LLM: 4.8+/-0.7%, BLM: 2.6 0.7%). There were no between group differences in muscle volume or lean mass in response to training. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the increase in muscle strength, muscle volume, and lean tissue mass when training with aRED was not different than when using the same training protocol with FW. The smaller increase in SQ 1RM in the aRED group may be the result of undersizing the aRED flywheels which were intended to mimic the inertial component of the SQ movement when performing FW exercises. However, the biomechanical differences observed in body position during the performance of the aRED SQ, which may have affected training and testing, cannot be excluded as a factor that may have affected SQ 1RM results. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Improvements in muscle strength, muscle volume and lean mass similar to FW exercise training may be elicited using an alternative source of resistance during exercise training. The acceleration of a mass during resistive exercise may result in greater muscle tension when changing the direction of movement resulting in enhanced strength gains. Therefore, to maximize the benefits of resistive exercise, the inertial components of FW exercise should be considered during exercise selection and hardware design.

19990089313,CONFERENCE_PAPER,The Effect of Gravity Fields on Cellular Gene Expression,"[""Hughes-Fulford, Millie""]","Early theoretical analysis predicted that microgravity effects on the isolated cell would be minuscule at the subcellular level; however, these speculations have not proven true in the real world. Astronauts experience a significant bone and muscle loss in as little as 2 weeks of spaceflight and changes are seen at the cellular level soon after exposure to microgravity. Changes in biological systems may be primarily due to the lack of gravity and the resulting loss of mechanical stress on tissues and cells. Recent ground and flight studies examining the effects of gravity or mechanical stress on cells demonstrate marked changes in gene expression when relatively small changes in mechanical forces or gravity fields were made. Several immediate early genes (IEG) like c-fos and c-myc are induced by mechanical stimulation within minutes. In contrast, several investigators report that the absence of mechanical forces during space flight result in decreased sera response element (SRE) activity and attenuation of expression of IEGs such as c-fos, c-jun and cox-2 mRNAs. Clearly, these early changes in gene expression may have long term consequences on mechanically sensitive cells. In our early studies on STS-56, we reported four major changes in the osteoblast; 1) prostaglandin synthesis in flight, 2) changes in cellular morphology, 3) altered actin cytoskeleton and 4) reduced osteoblast growth after four days exposure to microgravity. Initially, it was believed that changes in fibronectin (FN) RNA, FN protein synthesis or subsequent FN matrix formation might account for the changes in cytoskeleton and/ or reduction of growth. However our recent studies on Biorack (STS-76, STS-81 and STS-84), using ground and in-flight 1-G controls, demonstrated that fibronectin synthesis and matrix formation were normal in microgravity. In addition, in our most recent Biorack paper, our laboratory has documented that relative protein synthesis and mRNA synthesis are not changed after 24 hours exposure to microgravity. We did, however, find significant changes in osteoblast gene expression of IEGs, c-fos and cox-2 in microgravity exposure as compared to ground and in-flight 1-G controls. Subsequent ground studies suggest that the molecular mechanism underlying these changes may involve prostaglandin c-AMP receptors (EPs) and/or subsequent alteration of intracellular signaling in the absence of gravity.","[{""submissionId"":19990089313,""id"":""57bba4a85c9a46c9b875af40be8b55be"",""publicationName"":""Cells in Spaceflight: Past, Present and Future"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAG2-1086""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":19990089307,""title"":""Cells in Spaceflight: Past, Present and Future""},{""id"":19990089307,""title"":""Cells in Spaceflight: Past, Present and Future""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19990089313

The stresses of space travel affect nutritional balance, as evidenced by interrelated changes in body composition, energy utilization, and endocrine function. The limited data gathered thus far suggest that space flight incurs acute decreases in fluid mass and chronic, ongoing changes in muscle and bone mass. Concurrent with these changes is an increase in energy used per unit body mass. Other preliminary data suggest that bed rest and space flight may incur increased sensitivity to insulin. Further research is needed to determine the human energy and protein requirements for space, as well as a means of quantifying changes in body composition during extended-duration space flight.","[{""volume"":""50"",""submissionId"":19920055514,""issue"":""1, Ja"",""issn"":""0029-6643"",""id"":""fe6dde1775fb47be98505001849762d9"",""publicationName"":""Nutrition Reviews"",""publicationDate"":""1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19920055514

We are evaluating LBNP as a means to load the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems without gravity. Such loading should help prevent physiologic deconditioning during space flight.

Szewczyk"",""Georg Vogler"",""Karen Ocorr"",""Siddhita D. Mhatre""]","Thriving In DEep Space (TIDES) initiative aims to comprehensively understand how hostile environments such as the Moon and Mars affect human physiology. Here we present two NASA-selected spaceflight experiments under the TIDES portfolio, iGCE (Integrated Gravity Continuum Experiment) and MitoFlyght (Mitochondrial Investigation of Oxidative Stress in Flies). We hypothesize that exposure to spaceflight conditions induces oxidative stress responses that negatively impact physiology. The iGCE mission employs two well-established spaceflight models, Drosophila melanogaster and C.elegans, using Redwire’s Multi-use Variable-g Platform (MVP) hardware to assess changes in cardiac, muscle, and nervous systems across five different gravities: Hypergravity (2g), Earth (1g), Mars (0.37g), Moon (0.16g), and microgravity (ug). This mission focuses on uncovering alterations in protein homeostasis, autophagy, and mitochondrial function conserved across species. In the MitoFlyght mission to the ISS, Drosophila will be housed in the Vented Fly Box (VFB). This mission evaluates the oxidative stress response and autophagic pathway in muscle, heart, and nervous system. Additionally, we will (a) use the genetic mutant, <i>Tor7/P</i> to test whether increased autophagy is beneficial or a maladaptive response to the spaceflight stressors, and (b) utilize fly lines with tissue-specific expression (neuronal, muscle, and cardiac) of an antioxidant gene, <i>SOD2</i> (superoxide dismutase) as a potential countermeasure. Data from these missions will be compared with previous LEO-based datasets to identify shared signatures. Furthermore, cross-species analysis of the transcriptomic data from other invertebrate and vertebrate spaceflight studies will help determine evolutionarily conserved pathways perturbed by space stressors. Overall, both these missions aim to provide crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying oxidative stress responses, synaptic changes, and heart and muscle deficits, facilitating the identification of diagnostic and therapeutic targets to mitigate the adverse health effects of long-duration space habitation. Ultimately, this research will enhance our ability to thrive in deep space and inform future missions.","[{""submissionId"":20240008004,""id"":""318fefbd21c24009b9545462330f6483"",""publicationDate"":""2024-12-01T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240008004,""endDate"":""2024-12-07T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""42ca85bbf3b75cad8841938b20f13730"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Springfield, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""a9c6bd5c5b534336b3e897e88ee7e326"",""id"":""f2c39645d1434522b400c10feb681ec1""}],""name"":""ASGSR 2024"",""location"":""Puerto Rico"",""id"":""a9c6bd5c5b534336b3e897e88ee7e326"",""url"":""https://asgsr.org/asgsr-2024-puerto-rico/"",""startDate"":""2024-12-03T08:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""80NSSC24K0293"",""80NSSC22K0278""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240008004

20000029459,OTHER,The Effects of Partial Mechanical Loading and Ibandronate on Skeletal Tissues in the Adult Rat Hindquarter Suspension Model for Microgravity,"[""Schultheis, Lester W.""]","We report initial data from a suspended rat model that quantitatively relates chronic partial weightbearing to bone loss. Chronic partial weightbearing is our simulation of the effect of limited artificial gravity aboard spacecraft or reduced planetary gravity. Preliminary analysis of bone by PQCT, histomorphometry, mechanical testing and biochemistry suggest that chronic exposure to half of Earth gravity is insufficient to prevent severe bone loss. The effect of episodic full weightbearing activity (Earth Gravity) on rats otherwise at 50% weightbearing was also explored. This has similarity to treatment by an Earth G-rated centrifuge on a spacecraft that normally maintained artificial gravity at half of Earth G. Our preliminary evidence, using the above techniques to analyze bone, indicate that 2 hours daily of full weightbearing was insufficient to prevent the bone loss observed in 50% weightbearing animals. The effectiveness of partial weightbearing and episodic full weightbearing as potential countermeasures to bone loss in spaceflight was compared with treatment by ibandronate. Ibandronate, a long-acting potent bisphosphonate proved more effective in preventing bone loss and associated functionality based upon structure than our first efforts at mechanical countermeasures. The effectiveness of ibandronate was notable by each of the testing methods we used to study bone from gross structure and strength to tissue and biochemistry. These results appear to be independent of generalized systemic stress imposed by the suspension paradigm. Preliminary evidence does not suggest that blood levels of vitamin D were affected by our countermeasures. Despite the modest theraputic benefit of mechanical countermeasures of partial weightbearing and episodic full weightbearing, we know that some appropriate mechanical signal maintains bone mass in Earth gravity. Moreover, the only mechanism that correctly assigns bone mass and strength to oppose regionally specific force applied to bone is mechanical, a process based upon bone strain. Substantial evidence indicates that the specifics of dynamic loading i.e. time-varying forces are critical. Bone strain history is a predictor of the effect that mechanical conditions have on bone structure mass and strength. Using servo-controlled force plates on suspended rats with implanted strain gauges we manipulated impact forces of ambulation in the frequency (Fourier) domain. Our results indicate that high frequency components of impact forces are particularly potent in producing bone strain independent of the magnitude of the peak force or peak energy applied to the leg. Because a servo-system responds to forces produced by the rat's own muscle activity during ambulation, the direction of ground-reaction loads act on bone through the rat's own musculature. This is in distinction to passive vibration of the floor where forces reach bone through the natural filters of soft tissue and joints. Passive vibration may also be effective, but it may or may not increase bone in the appropriate architectural pattern to oppose the forces of normal ambulatory activity. Effectiveness of high frequency mechanical stimulation in producing regional (muscle directed) bone response will be limited by 1. the sensitivity of bone to a particular range of frequencies and 2. the inertia of the muscles, limiting their response to external forces by increasing tension along insertions. We have begun mathematical modeling of normal ambulatory activity. Effectiveness of high frequency mechanical stimulation in producing regional (muscle directed) bone response will be limited by 1. the sensitivity of bone to a particular range of frequencies and 2. the inertia of the muscles, limiting their response to external forces by increasing tension along insertions. We have begun mathematical modeling of the rat forelimb as a transfer function between impact force and bone strain to predict optimal dynamic loading conditions for this system. We plan additional studies of mechanical counter-measures that incorporate improved dynamic loading, features relevant to anticipated evaluation of artificial gravity, exercise regimens and exposure to Martian gravity, The combination of mechanical countermeasures with ibandronate will also be investigated for signs of synergy.","[{""submissionId"":20000029459,""id"":""237adff5e3504a2d8294475641214311"",""publicationName"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute"",""publicationDate"":""1999-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""},{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000029459

S."",""Fisher, E. A."",""Esteves, J. T."",""Taylor, L. C."",""DeDios, Y. E."",""Harm, D. L.""]","Despite rigorous exercise and nutritional management during space missions, astronauts returning from microgravity exhibit neuromuscular deficits and a significant loss in muscle mass in the postural muscles of the lower leg. Similar changes in the postural muscles occur in subjects participating in long-duration bed rest studies. These adaptive muscle changes manifest as a reduction in reflex conduction velocity during head-down bed rest. Because the stretch reflex encompasses both the peripheral (muscle spindle and nerve axon) and central (spinal synapse) components involved in adaptation to calf muscle unloading, it may be used to provide feedback on the general condition of neuromuscular function, and might be used to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures aimed at preserving muscle mass and function during periods of unloading. Stretch reflexes were measured on 18 control subjects who spent 60 to 90 days in continuous 6 deg head-down bed rest. Using a motorized system capable of rotating the foot around the ankle joint (dorsiflexion) through an angle of 10 degrees at a peak velocity of about 250 deg/sec, a stretch reflex was recorded from the subject's left triceps surae muscle group. Using surface electromyography, about 300 reflex responses were obtained and ensemble-averaged on 3 separate days before bed rest, 3 to 4 times in bed, and 3 times after bed rest. The averaged responses for each test day were examined for reflex latency and conduction velocity (CV) across gender. Computerized posturography was also conducted on these same subjects before and after bed rest as part of the standard measures. Peak-to-peak sway was measured during Sensory Organization Tests (SOTs) to evaluate changes in the ability to effectively use or suppress visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive information for postural control. Although no gender differences were found, a significant increase in reflex latency and a significant decrease in CV were observed during the bed rest period, with a return to baseline 3 to 5 days after bed rest, depending on the duration of bed rest. In addition, a relationship between CV and loss of muscle strength in the lower leg was observed post bed rest for most subjects. Immediately post-bed rest, most subjects showed decreased performance on SOTs, with the greater decrements on sway-referenced support and head movement conditions. Post-bed rest decrements were less than typically observed following spaceflight. Decrements in postural control and the stretch reflex can be primarily attributed to the unloading mechanisms this ground-based analog provides. The stretch reflex is a concise test measurement that can be obtained during the head-down phase of bed rest, as it does not interfere with the bed rest paradigm. This makes it an ideal tool that can detect, early on, whether a countermeasure is successful in preserving muscle function.","[{""submissionId"":20110023207,""id"":""949cd53a4d434de284b37f0572990934"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110023207,""endDate"":""2012-02-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""e631641bbe224bf5b0f850187ff5c50a"",""startDate"":""2012-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110023207

Bone ash was reduced in vertebrae (L5) but not in the non-weight-bearing calvaria or mandibles. All tissues had a relatively normal percentage composition of Ca, P, and Mg. Nevertheless, flight rat calvaria and vertebral tissues tended to exhibit lower Ca/P and higher Ca/Mg ratios that any of their weight-matched controls groups, and gradient density analysis (calvaria) indicated a strong shift to the fractions lower specific gravity that was commensurate with impaired rates of matrix-mineral maturation. X-ray diffraction data were confirmatory. Bone hydroxyapatite crystal growth in the mandibles of flight rats was preferentially altered in such a way as to reduce their size (C-axis dimension). But in the mandibular diastemal region devoid of muscle attachments, flight rat bone and dentin were normal with respect to the Ca, P, Mg, and Zn concentrations and Ca/P and Ca/Mg ratios of age-matched controls.

The objective of this study was to determine decrements in muscle size, if any, in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles of male and female astronauts after 9 days of space flight. Methods: Eight astronauts, one female and seven male, between the ages of 31 and 59 years 59-84 kg in body weight were examined by MRI 2-3 times preflight within 16 days before launch, and 2 days, (n=6) and seven days (n=3) after landing.

Thirty to forty 3-5 mm thick slices were acquired in 256 x 128 or 256 x 256 matrices. Acquisition time lasted 20-40 minutes. Multiple slices were measured by computerized planimetry. Results: Compared to the preflight, the cross-sectoral areas (CSA) of the soleus, gastrocnemius, and the leg, at 2 days after landing were reduced (at least p less than 0.05) 8.9 percent, 13.2 percent, and 9.5 percent respectively. The soleus and the leg of three astronauts evaluated at 7 days postflight did not show full recovery compared to the preflight values.

The capabilities of the spacelab for life sciences research in space will be described. Among the many results to be discussed are the effects of microgravity on amphibian fertilization and early development, and on the rodent musculoskeletal and neural systems. Xenopus laevis eggs fertilized in space developed normally during and after an eight day spaceflight. Ultrastructural studies of rodent tissue demonstrated that spaceflight-induced atrophy of antigravity skeletal muscles renders muscle fibers susceptible to structural failure upon return to weight bearing postflight. Principle TEM changes in neuromuscular junctions are the decrease or absence of synaptic vesicles and degeneration of axon terminals. In bone, architectural rather than compositional changes may be the primary perturbation. Thus, many techniques used on Earth (such as density determinations) would not detect significant changes in bone strength. An increment in synaptic number and changes in synapse distribution occur in peripheral gravity sensors. There is a decrease in muscarinic cholinergic receptor density in the striatum. Striatal receptor changes suggest spaceflight-related alterations in motor activity.

19940009288,OTHER,Comparative measurement of visual stability in Earth and cosmic space (L-4),"[""Koga, Kazugo""]","The frequency and the intensity of space motion sickness was reviewed and investigated. Unusual induced-gravity situations, such as rotation, linear acceleration, parallel swinging etc. were investigated as well. Visually-induced motion sensation or distorted perception were evaluated with respect to visual stability by many investigators. These studies are all concerned with the effect of gravity and the induction of motion sickness through human visual perception. Direct investigation under the microgravity situation, such as parabolic flight, Skylab, and Spacelab, was carried out. These studies focused on how human visual stability is established through various sensory afferents in specific gravity conditions. Results from these investigations indicate that sensory mismatch probably plays an important role in space motion sickness. The interaction of visual, vestibular, and somatosensory perception is smoothly coordinated under normal gravitational conditions on the Earth in our daily life. When the cooperation is destroyed or a mismatch occurs among them, motion sickness may develop not only on the Earth but also in microgravity. The latter case may be the cause of space motion sickness or space adaption syndrome. How human beings obtain visual stability even with posture changes on the ground was investigated. Visual stability can be categorized as static or dynamic. Static visual stability is concerned with orientation and dynamic stability is concerned with object motion perception. The perception of visual stability is modified by many other sensations, such as somatosensory, vestibular, and muscle tension. We will mainly focus on modifications by vestibular inputs to visual perception produced by eye movements in microgravity. The Vestibular-Oscular Reflex (VOR) is a well-known characteristic which results from the relationship between eye mobility and vestibular afferent inputs. Eye movements also modify dynamic visual perception, such as perceived object motion velocity. The VOR is constantly simulated under 1-g conditions on Earth. In fact, human beings have been habituated and 'programmed' for orientation (visual stability) in their everyday, 1-g environment. When humans are exposed to a different gravity situation, this programmed behavior must change; that is, it is reprogrammed. This is called habituation or familiarization. We hope to examine how object motion perception is perturbed and subsequently adapted in the microgravity environment. This experiment is focused on the cooperation of visual, vestibular, and somatosensory perception coordination and how it is changed or reduced in space compared to 1-g environment. We will obtain information on the coordination between eye movement and neck muscle activity by using EOG and EMG. We will also collect data from Payload Specialists using a self-diagnostic questionnaire concerned with perceptual abnormality. When each sensory input function and its integration in the higher nervous system are well-characterized, then more effective techniques to control SAS may be developed.","[{""submissionId"":19940009288,""id"":""afc3ecb389004e48ade4f4218e800d2a"",""publicationName"":""NASA.

The main objectives of this functional performance evaluation were to investigate the physiological effects of long-duration spaceflight on skeletal muscle strength and endurance, as well as aerobic capacity and orthostatic function. Long-duration exposure to a microgravity environment may produce physiological alterations that affect crew ability to complete critical tasks such as extravehicular activity (EVA), intravehicular activity (IVA), and nominal or emergency egress. Ultimately, this information will be used to develop and verify countermeasures. The answers to three specific functional performance questions were sought: (1) What are the performance decrements resulting from missions of varying durations? (2) What are the physical requirements for successful entry, landing, and emergency egress from the Shuttle? and (3) What combination of preflight fitness training and in-flight countermeasures will minimize in-flight muscle performance decrements? To answer these questions, the Exercise Countermeasures Project looked at physiological changes associated with muscle degradation as well as orthostatic intolerance. A means of ensuring motor coordination was necessary to maintain proficiency in piloting skills, EVA, and IVA tasks. In addition, it was necessary to maintain musculoskeletal strength and function to meet the rigors associated with moderate altitude bailout and with nominal or emergency egress from the landed Orbiter. Eight investigations, referred to as Detailed Supplementary Objectives (DSOs) 475, 476, 477, 606, 608, 617, 618, and 624, were conducted to study muscle degradation and the effects of exercise on exercise capacity and orthostatic function (Table 3-1). This chapter is divided into three parts. Part 1 describes specific findings from studies of muscle strength, endurance, fiber size, and volume. Part 2 describes results from studies of how in-flight exercise affects postflight exercise capacity and orthostatic function. Part 3 focuses on the development of new noninvasive methods for assessing body composition in astronauts and how those methods can be used to correlate measures of exercise performance and changes in body composition.","[{""submissionId"":20040201536,""id"":""2dff17c2f864472782fbd233ef1bddce"",""publicationName"":""Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20040201524,""title"":""Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project""},{""id"":20040201524,""title"":""Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040201536

K."",""Monga, M."",""Rajasekaran, M."",""Ziegler, M. G."",""Smith, S. M."",""Schneider, S. M.""]","Previous exercise in space has lacked sufficient loads to maintain preflight cardiovascular and musculoskeletal mass and function. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) produces a static force equivalent to one Earth body weight by each 52 mm Hg of LBNP during supine posture. LBNP also provides transmural blood pressures simulating upright exercise. Thus, this artificial-gravity concept may help maintain cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems of crewmembers during prolonged exposure to microgravity. Currently available, bungee cord assisted, treadmill exercise is limited by harness discomfort, lower than normal loads, abnormal post-flight gait, and the absence of gravitational blood pressures within the vascular system. PURPOSE: This project evaluates a method to create artificial gravity using supine LBNP treadmill exercise to prevent loss of physiologic function in microgravity simulated by 30 days of bed rest. Identical twins were used as volunteers so that statistical power could be maximized. This countermeasure is being transitioned to space flight. CURRENT STATUS OF RESEARCH Methods: Six sets of identical twins (6 females and 14 males, 21-36 years) remained in 6 head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest for 30 days to simulate prolonged microgravity. Six subjects were randomly selected to exercise supine in an LBNP chamber for 40 minutes six days per week (EX group), while their twin brothers served as non-exercise controls (CON). Pressure within the exercise LBNP chamber was adjusted to increase load, hence increasing exercise intensity. During supine treadmill exercise, LBNP (52-63 mmHg) was applied to produce foot ward forces equivalent to those for upright running on Earth at 1.0-1.2 times body weight (BW) and subjects performed an interval exercise protocol (40-80% peak exercise capacity [VO2pk]). Five minutes of resting LBNP immediately followed each exercise session. Results: Orthostatic tolerance time decreased significantly after 30 days bed rest in the CON group, but was relatively maintained in the EX group. VO2pk was maintained in EX males, but not in CON males. Isokinetic knee strength (extension, peak torque) decreased significantly in CON males, but was preserved in EX males. The EX group had significantly higher spine muscle strength after bed rest than the CON group. The cross-sectional area of spinal muscle at L4/5 level decreased significantly in the CON group but not in the EX group. Urinary n-telopeptide excretion, an index of bone resorption, was increased during bed rest in CON, but not in EX subjects. This suggests protection by LBNP exercise against the increase in bone resorption typically seen in simulated and actual microgravity. Significant changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in the spine and ribs were observed in CON subjects, but not in EX subjects. Conclusions: Our treadmill exercise protocol within LBNP plus a short period of post-exercise LBNP maintains orthostatic responses, upright exercise capacity and other important physiologic parameters during bed rest. These results document the efficacy of our apparatus and exercise protocol for maintaining physiologic structure and function during long-duration microgravity as simulated by 30 days of HDT bed rest. FUTURE PLANS: More sets of female identical twins are needed to reach significance. The LBNP exercise chamber will be redesigned for flight.","[{""submissionId"":20100031151,""id"":""02d05b7711fd47c4af33e1778791a082"",""publicationDate"":""2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20100031151,""name"":""BloastronaUliCS Workshop"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""c1f40cfa07ed46df9e752cc24d66384b"",""startDate"":""2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""GCRC-M01-RR00827"",""NCC2-1133""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100031151

To meet this need, designers and scientists at NASA Ames Research Center, Life Science Division, have worked to develop more effective exercise devices for long-duration exposure to microgravity. One of these concepts is the Inter-Limb Resistance Device which allows the subject to exercise one limb directly against another, strengthening muscle groups in the arms, legs, and back. It features a modular harness with an inelastic cable and instrumented pulley. Forces similar to other high resistance exercise equipment are generated. Sensors in the pulley measure force and velocity for performance feedback display and data acquisition. This free-floating apparatus avoids vibration of sensitive experiments on board spacecraft. Compact with low mass, this hardware is also well suited for a 'safe haven' from radiation on board Space Station Freedom, and may prove useful in confined environments on Earth, such as Antarctic stations, submarines, and other underwater habitats.

In addition to uses within the space program, the compact resistive packs of the CFREU allow the unit to be small enough for easy use as a home gym for personal use, or as a supplement for rehabilitation programs. Resistive packs may be changed conveniently out of the CFREU according to the desired exercise regimen.

19940023860,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Eccentric exercise testing and training,"[""Clarkson, Priscilla M.""]","Some researchers and practitioners have touted the benefits of including eccentric exercise in strength training programs. However, others have challenged its use because they believe that eccentric actions are dangerous and lead to injuries. Much of the controversy may be based on a lack of understanding of the physiology of eccentric actions. This review will present data concerning eccentric exercise in strength training, the physiological characteristics of eccentric exercise, and the possible stimulus for strength development. Also a discussion of strength needs for extended exposure to microgravity will be presented. Not only is the use of eccentric exercise controversial, but the name itself is fraught with problems. The correct pronunciation is with a hard 'c' so that the word sounds like ekscentric. The confusion in pronunciation may have been prevented if the spelling that Asmussen used in 1953, excentric, had been adopted. Another problem concerns the expressions used to describe eccentric exercise. Commonly used expressions are negatives, eccentric contractions, lengthening contractions, resisted muscle lengthenings, muscle lengthening actions, and eccentric actions. Some of these terms are cumbersome (i.e., resisted muscle lengthenings), one is slang (negatives), and another is an oxymoron (lengthening contractions). Only eccentric action is appropriate and adoption of this term has been recommended by Cavanagh. Despite the controversy that surrounds eccentric exercise, it is important to note that these types of actions play an integral role in normal daily activities. Eccentric actions are used during most forms of movement, for example, in walking when the foot touches the ground and the center of mass is decelerated and in lowering objects, such as placing a bag of groceries in the car.","[{""submissionId"":19940023860,""id"":""556c596063214fd1ad5a82ff300ec180"",""publicationName"":""NASA.

Intelligent Automation, Inc., has developed ESPRIT to monitor exercise activities, detect body markers, extract image features, and recover three-dimensional (3D) kinematic body poses. The system relies on prior knowledge and modeling of the human body and on advanced statistical inference techniques to achieve robust and accurate motion capture.

C."",""Blaber, Elizabeth A.""]","Spaceflight environments and their associated conditions, such as microgravity and space radiation, cause many biological functions formerly considered to be standard to behave in nonstandard ways. Exposure to microgravity has shown to induce deleterious effects in stem cell-based tissue regeneration, leading to immune system and healing response impairments as well as muscle and bone density loss. Such risks must be mitigated in order for long-term human space exploration to proceed. Thus, our work seeks to explore mechanisms of stem cell-based tissue regeneration that experience changes in spaceflight environments. Cellular senescence is a process of inducing cell cycle arrest that can be initiated by various stimuli. This function is influenced by two major pathways, controlled by p53 and pRB tumor suppressor proteins. p53 activity targets the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene p21Cdkn1a in osteogenic cell cycle arrest. Under conditions of mechanical unloading, stem cell-based tissue regeneration has shown to be decreased in both proliferation and differentiation, as many cells are arrested in progenitor states. p21 has shown upregulation in expression under conditions of microgravity, suggesting its role in regenerative bone formation arrest in space. p21 levels are found to be elevated independent of p53, suggesting a decrease in proliferation and regeneration without apoptosis, but rather through cell cycle arrest alone. Thus, we hypothesize that p21 is a mediator of cellular senescence in bone marrow stem cells. Culturing of bone marrow stem cells from wild type and p21 knockout mice under osteoblastogenic conditions will be completed to explore the role of p21Cdkn1a in stem cell proliferation and maturation. We believe that decreases in somatic stem cell differentiation may occur after spaceflight due to signal pathway alterations that result in downstream inhibition of genes involved in differentiation, preventing tissue from repairing and regenerating normally.

The DAP Musculoskeletal Modeling effort is developing computational models to inform exercise countermeasure development and to predict physical performance capabilities after a length of time in space. For example, integrated exercise device-biomechanical models can determine localized loading, which will be used as input to muscle and bone adaptation models to estimate the effectiveness of the exercise countermeasure. In addition, simulations of mission tasks can be used to estimate the astronaut's ability to perform the task after exposure to microgravity and after using various exercise countermeasures. The software package OpenSim (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) (Ref. 1) is being used to create the DAP biomechanical models and its built-in muscle model is the starting point for the DAP muscle model. During Exploration missions, such as those to asteroids and Mars, astronauts will be exposed to reduced gravity for extended periods. Therefore, the crew must have access to exercise countermeasures that can maintain their musculoskeletal and aerobic health. Exploration vehicles may have very limited volume and power available to accommodate such capabilities, even more so than the International Space Station (ISS). The exercise devices flown on Exploration missions must be designed to provide sufficient load during the performance of various resistance and aerobic/anaerobic exercises while meeting potential additional requirements of limited mass, volume and power. Given that it is not practical to manufacture and test (ground, analog and/or flight) all candidate devices, nor is it always possible to obtain data such as localized muscle and bone loading empirically, computational modeling can estimate the localized loading during various exercise modalities performed on a given device to help formulate exercise prescriptions and other operational considerations.

Among the physiological functions that are affected when humans or animals are exposed to space flight conditions is the immune response. The focus of this review is on the function of the immune system in space flight conditions during actual space flights, as well as in models of space flight conditions on the earth. The experiments were carried out in tissue culture systems, in animal models, and in human subjects. The results indicate that space flight conditions alter cell-mediated immune responses, including lymphocyte proliferation and subset distribution, and cytokine production. The mechanism(s) of space flight-induced alterations in immune system function remain(s) to be established. It is likely, however, that multiple factors, including microgravity, stress, neuroendocrine factors, sleep disruption, and nutritional factors, are involved in altering certain functions of the immune system. Such alterations could lead to compromised defenses against infections and tumors.","[{""volume"":""18"",""submissionId"":20040087589,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""0048-7554"",""id"":""51fc7aa52ed642258c6dc5603eb939e3"",""publicationName"":""Reviews on environmental health"",""publicationDate"":""2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040087589

This experimental paradigm produces an environment in which, from the cell's perspective, the gravitational vector is ""nulled"" by continuous averaging. In that respect, the clinostat simulates one aspect of space microgravity where the gravity force is greatly reduced. After clinorotation, the AChR channel mean open-time and conductance were statistically not different from control values but showed a rotation-dependent trend that suggests a process of cellular adaptation to clinorotation. These findings therefore suggest that the ACHR channel function may not be affected in the microgravity of space despite changes in the receptor's cellular organization.","[{""volume"":""8"",""submissionId"":20040088953,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""0914-9201"",""id"":""6cd9bfe2537f4588ac761cd03a663a9a"",""publicationName"":""Uchu seibutsu kagaku"",""publicationDate"":""1994-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NAGW-1705"",""HL 07249""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088953
20160014528,ABSTRACT,Translational Cellular Research on the International Space Station,"[""Love, John"",""Cooley, Vic""]","The emerging field of Translational Research aims to coalesce interdisciplinary findings from basic science for biomedical applications. To complement spaceflight research using human subjects, translational studies can be designed to address aspects of space-related human health risks and help develop countermeasures to prevent or mitigate them, with therapeutical benefits for analogous conditions experienced on Earth. Translational research with cells and model organisms is being conducted onboard the International Space Station (ISS) in connection with various human systems impacted by spaceflight, such as the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and immune systems. Examples of recent cell-based translational investigations on the ISS include the following. The JAXA investigation Cell Mechanosensing seeks to identify gravity sensors in skeletal muscle cells to develop muscle atrophy countermeasures by analyzing tension fluctuations in the plasma membrane, which changes the expression of key proteins and genes. Earth applications of this study include therapeutic approaches for some forms of muscular dystrophy, which appear to parallel aspects of muscle wasting in space. Spheroids is an ESA investigation examining the system of endothelial cells lining the inner surface of all blood vessels in terms of vessel formation, cellular proliferation, and programmed cell death, because injury to the endothelium has been implicated as underpinning various cardiovascular and musculoskeletal problems arising during spaceflight. Since endothelial cells are involved in the functional integrity of the vascular wall, this research has applications to Earth diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and hypertension. The goal of the T-Cell Activation in Aging NASA investigation is to understand human immune system depression in microgravity by identifying gene expression patterns of candidate molecular regulators, which will provide further insight into factors that may play a critical role in immune function loss during aging. In addition, Omics investigations with cells have synergistic applications ranging from the evaluation of pharmacological countermeasures to drug discovery. Thus, cell-based translational research onboard the ISS is bidirectionally bridging cutting-edge cellular and molecular approaches with space bioastronautics and human health methodologies on Earth.","[{""submissionId"":20160014528,""id"":""f505bdf9439b4e7888626d6fc3a4b66a"",""publicationDate"":""2016-12-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Russia"",""submissionId"":20160014528,""endDate"":""2016-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""3fb4413e9fb94183b854aa10d06439f4"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Institute of Biomedical Problems"",""location"":""Moscow, Russian Federation""}},""meetingId"":""d59b3e2026a54c4ebf3808b2f8482885"",""id"":""ab000840e429421aa147ff99189d4376""}],""name"":""Conference on Space Biology and Medicine"",""location"":""Moscow"",""id"":""d59b3e2026a54c4ebf3808b2f8482885"",""startDate"":""2016-12-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160014528

The sitting or horizontal position is sought by the body to relieve the strain of the upright or vertical postures, for example during syncopal situations, bone fractures, muscle injuries, fatigue, and probably also to reduce energy expenditure. Most health-care personnel are aware that adaptive responses occurring during bed rest proceed concomitantly with the healing process; signs and symptoms associated with the former should be differentiated from those of the latter. Not all illnesses and infirmities benefit from prolonged bed rest. Considerations in prescribing bed rest for patients-including duration, body position, mode and duration of exercise, light-dark cycles, temperature, and humidity-have not been investigated adequately. More recently, adaptive physiological responses have been measured in normal, healthy subjects in the horizontal or slightly head-down postures during prolonged bed rest as analogs for the adaptive responses of astronauts exposed to the microgravity environment of outer and bed-rest research.","[{""volume"":""2"",""submissionId"":20000065651,""issue"":""Chapter 39"",""publisher"":""Oxford University Press"",""id"":""5b5cf31dd4d74da3ac4a847fdffadce8"",""publicationName"":""Handbook of Physiology.

One of these techniques is electrical bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS). Although not new, this is a technique whose applications to biomedical research are fairly recent. What is new is the development of instrumentation that has made practical the use of impedance spectroscopy in the biomedical setting, particularly in studies involving human subjects. The purpose of this paper is to report impedance spectroscopy observations made on a subject who was submitted to bed rest for a period of thirty days. These observations were made as part of a study on muscle atrophy during a thirty day head down bed rest.

Habitation in space poses unique challenges to human cells and organ systems. Biomedical research with rodents (primarily mice and rats) can help to both unravel molecular, cellular and physiologic mechanisms relevant to humans and test candidate interventions that mitigate adverse effects of space on humans, such as muscle atrophy, bone loss and cardiovascular deconditioning. One favored hypothesis that may explain the detrimental effects of spaceflight on humans is that reduced mechanical loading in microgravity accelerates aging. Rodents provide a relevant model system to study this problem as they age 40 times faster than humans. Now scientists from both public and commercial sectors conduct rodent experiments on the ISS using a new capability developed primarily at ARC. Results from the maiden voyage of the Rodent Research Project on the ISS reveal that long duration effects of spaceflight appear far different than short duration effects. Thus, Rodent Research missions on the ISS usher in a new era for exploration and biological discovery in space.","[{""submissionId"":20190000449,""id"":""096e81cd0e2b4c2cbce66098bd141724"",""publicationDate"":""2015-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190000449,""name"":""NASA Ames Research Center"",""location"":""Moffett Field, CA, United States"",""id"":""af4a1d62b71040309f83652678fb784f""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190000449,""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Ames Research Center"",""location"":""Moffett Field, CA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""416808edf84c44fd96f8ba76e372c3c4"",""id"":""c0b22eb79cc14b22bd68bf69416a0af0""}],""name"":""Seminar at ARC Summer Series"",""location"":""Moffett Field, CA"",""id"":""416808edf84c44fd96f8ba76e372c3c4"",""startDate"":""2015-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 904211.01.30.41""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190000449
20020042355,ABSTRACT,Gravity of Living Systems: May the Force Be With You,"[""Hargens, Alan R."",""Holton, Emily M.""]","Gravity, the force which shapes the architecture of organisms from single cells to dinosaurs, has been the most constant environmental factor during the evolution of species on Earth. With long-duration space flight, an understanding of how gravity affects living systems gains greater urgency in order to maintain the health and performance of crews who will explore the solar system. For example, the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems are normally exposed to gravitational gradients of blood pressure and weight on Earth. Such gradients increase blood pressure and tissue weight in dependent tissues of the body. Thus, from a physiologic standpoint, these systems are greatly affected by altered gravity. Exposure to actual and simulated microgravity causes blood and tissue fluid to shift from the legs to the head. Studies of humans in space have documented facial edema, space adaptation syndrome, decreased plasma volume, muscle atrophy, and loss of bone strength. Return of astronauts to Earth is accompanied by orthostatic intolerance, decreased neuromuscular coordination, and reduced exercise capacity. These factors decrease performance during descent from orbit and increase risk during emergency egress from the space craft. Models of simulated microgravity include 60 head-down tilt, immersion, and prolonged horizontal bedrest. Head-down tilt and dry immersion are the most accepted models and studies using these models of up to one year have been performed in Russia. Sensitive animal models which offer clear insights into the role of gravity on structure and function include the developing giraffe and snakes from various habitats. Finally, possible countermeasures to speed readaptation of astronauts to gravity after prolonged space flight include exercise, lower body negative pressure, and centrifugation.","[{""submissionId"":20020042355,""id"":""da73b8e4941b415eb5786765fbe4d59e"",""publicationDate"":""1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20020042355,""endDate"":""1997-09-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""International Symposium of Adaptive Physiology"",""location"":""Framingham, MA"",""id"":""4c75708fcbc649e6be852d2288553b83"",""startDate"":""1997-09-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""RTOP 199-26-12-34""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020042355
20060023359,PREPRINT,The Art of Space Flight Exercise Hardware: Design and Implementation,"[""Beyene, Nahom M.""]","The design of space flight exercise hardware depends on experience with crew health maintenance in a microgravity environment, history in development of flight-quality exercise hardware, and a foundation for certifying proper project management and design methodology. Developed over the past 40 years, the expertise in designing exercise countermeasures hardware at the Johnson Space Center stems from these three aspects of design. The medical community has steadily pursued an understanding of physiological changes in humans in a weightless environment and methods of counteracting negative effects on the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system. The effects of weightlessness extend to the pulmonary and neurovestibular system as well with conditions ranging from motion sickness to loss of bone density. Results have shown losses in water weight and muscle mass in antigravity muscle groups. With the support of university-based research groups and partner space agencies, NASA has identified exercise to be the primary countermeasure for long-duration space flight. The history of exercise hardware began during the Apollo Era and leads directly to the present hardware on the International Space Station. Under the classifications of aerobic and resistive exercise, there is a clear line of development from the early devices to the countermeasures hardware used today. In support of all engineering projects, the engineering directorate has created a structured framework for project management. Engineers have identified standards and ""best practices"" to promote efficient and elegant design of space exercise hardware. The quality of space exercise hardware depends on how well hardware requirements are justified by exercise performance guidelines and crew health indicators. When considering the microgravity environment of the device, designers must consider performance of hardware separately from the combined human-in-hardware system. Astronauts are the caretakers of the hardware while it is deployed and conduct all sanitization, calibration, and maintenance for the devices. Thus, hardware designs must account for these issues with a goal of minimizing crew time on orbit required to complete these tasks. In the future, humans will venture to Mars and exercise countermeasures will play a critical role in allowing us to continue in our spirit of exploration. NASA will benefit from further experimentation on Earth, through the International Space Station, and with advanced biomechanical models to quantify how each device counteracts specific symptoms of weightlessness. With the continued support of international space agencies and the academic research community, we will usher the next frontier in human space exploration.","[{""submissionId"":20060023359,""id"":""bf4c77e6dfeb4220ae6f0ecb662a2fc2"",""publicationDate"":""2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20060023359,""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""dc89a2436e4a4b52b0d4b46bda38e6c6""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20060023359,""endDate"":""2004-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""a54fdea3af9f4930bfcaf774b40d9eff"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Northrop Grumman Corp."",""location"":""Los Angeles, CA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""8b099242ea2349c18eff1d603113eba8"",""id"":""c696a61598084017bce784b95e3731fa""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""United States""}},""meetingId"":""8b099242ea2349c18eff1d603113eba8"",""id"":""af1a96c308ab4c468f02f3bb42e424cb""}],""name"":""AIAA Space 2004 Conference and Exposition"",""location"":""San Diego, CA"",""id"":""8b099242ea2349c18eff1d603113eba8"",""startDate"":""2004-09-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20060023359

Researchers have shown that gravity plays a role in ventilation and blood flow distribution, gas exchange, alveolar size and mechanical stresses within the lung. Short exposure to microgravity produced marked alterations in lung blood flow and ventilation distribution while hypergravity exaggerated the regional differences in lung structure and function resulting in reduced ventilation at the base and no ventilation of the upper half of the lung. Microgravity also decreased metabolic activity in cardiac cells, WI-38 embryonic lung cells, and human lymphocytes. Rats, in the tail-suspended head-down tilt model, experienced transient loss of lung water, contrary to an expected increase due to pooling of blood in the pulmonary vasculature. Hypergravity has also been found to increase the proliferation of several different cell lines (e.g., chick embryo fibroblasts) while decreasing cell motility and slowing liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy. These studies show that changes in the gravity environment will affect several aspects of organ and cellular function and produce major change in blood flow and tissue/organ perfusion. However, these past studies have not addressed whether ischemia-reperfusion injury will be exacerbated or ameliorated by changes in the gravity environment, e.g., space flight. Currently, nothing is known about how gravity will affect the susceptibility of different lung and vascular cells to this type of injury. We conducted studies that addressed the following question: Does the susceptibility of lung fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle, and endothelial cells to anoxia/reoxygenation injury change following exposure to hypergravity conditions?","[{""volume"":""1"",""submissionId"":20010000510,""id"":""84368fc1710d4802838ba1571d48a224"",""publicationName"":""NASA University Research Centers Technical Advances in Education, Aeronautics, Space, Autonomy, Earth and Environment"",""publicationDate"":""1997-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NCCW-85"",""NAG9-644""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20010000359,""title"":""NASA University Research Centers Technical Advances in Education, Aeronautics, Space, Autonomy, Earth and Environment""},{""id"":20010000359,""title"":""NASA University Research Centers Technical Advances in Education, Aeronautics, Space, Autonomy, Earth and Environment""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20010000510

Currently, an Interim Resistive Exercise Device (iRED) is being flown on board the ISS to help counteract these losses. Free weight training has shown successful positive musculoskeletal adaptations. In biomechanical research, ground reaction forces (GRF) trajectories are used to define differences between exercise devices. The purpose of this evaluation is to quantify the differences in GRF between the iRED and free weight exercise performed on a Smith machine during a squat. Due to the differences in resistance properties, inertial loading and load application to the body between the two devices, we hypothesize that subjects using iRED will produce GRF that are significantly different from the Smith machine. There will be differences in bar/harness range of motion and the time when peak GRF occurred in the ROMbar. Three male subjects performed three sets of ten squats on the iRED and on the Smith Machine on two separate days at a 2-second cadence. Statistically significant differences were found between the two devices in all measured GRF variables. Average Fz and Fx during the Smith machine squat were significantly higher than iRED. Average Fy (16.82 plus or minus.23; p less than .043) was significantly lower during the Smith machine squat. The mean descent/ascent ratio of the magnitude of the resultant force vector of all three axes for the Smith machine and iRED was 0.95 and 0.72, respectively. Also, the point at which maximum Fz occurred in the range of motion (Dzpeak) was at different locations with the two devices.","[{""submissionId"":20040077030,""id"":""ede154c602594552898d6566f762a1bb"",""publicationDate"":""2004-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040077030

Subjects estimated targeted joint angles during isovelocity (IsoV) joint movements with agonist muscle groups either active or relaxed. These movements included elbow extension (EE) and elbow flexion (EF), and plantarflexion (PF) and dorsiflexion (DF) of the ankle. Subjects also estimated these joint positions while moving the dynamometer at their chosen (variable) velocity (VarV) during EE and PF. For IsoV tests, no differences were observed between active and passive movements for either the ankle or elbow. Compared with those of pre-flight test days, estimates of targeted elbow joint angles were approximately 5 degrees to 15 degrees more flexed in-flight, and returned toward the pre-flight values during recovery. The spaceflight effects for the ankle were inconsistent and less prevalent than those for the elbow. The VarV PF test condition for the 120 degrees target angle at the ankle exhibited approximately 5 degrees to 7 degrees more DF target angle estimates in-flight compared with those pre- or post-flight. In contrast, during IsoV PF there was a tendency for ankle estimates to be approximately 2 degrees to 3 degrees more PF after 2-3 days exposure to spaceflight. These data indicate that during spaceflight the perception of elbow extension is greater than actuality, and are consistent with the interpretation that microgravity induced a flexor bias in the estimation of the actual elbow joint position. Moreover, these effects in joint proprioception during spaceflight were observed in individual isolated single-joint movements during tasks in which vestibular function in maintaining posture were minimal.","[{""volume"":""152"",""submissionId"":20040087608,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""0014-4819"",""id"":""fec9cae122084d6293efe7bb4a0d3423"",""publicationName"":""Experimental brain research.

J."",""Powell, D.""]","The UTMB/NASA Flight Analog Research Unit is an inpatient unit with a bionutrition kitchen and unique testing areas for studying subjects subjected to 6 degree head-down complete bed rest for prolonged periods as an analog for zero gravity. Bed rest allows study of physiological changes and performance of functional tasks representative of critical interplanetary mission operations and measures of the efficacy of countermeasures designed to protect against the resulting deleterious effects. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Subjects are healthy adults 24-55 years old; 60 75 in tall; body mass index 18.5-30; and bone mineral density normal by DXA scan. Over 100 subjects have been studied in 7 campaigns since 2004. The iRAT countermeasure combines high intensity interval aerobic exercises on alternating days with continuous aerobic exercise. Resistance exercise is performed 3 days per week. Subjects are tested on an integrated suite of functional and interdisciplinary physiological tests before and after 70 days of total bed rest. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: It is anticipated that post-bed rest functional performance will be predicted by a weighted combination of sensorimotor, cardiovascular and muscle physiological factors. Control subjects who do not participate in the exercise countermeasure will have significantly greater decreases in these parameters. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Astronauts experience alterations in multiple physiological systems due to exposure to the microgravity, leading to disruption in the ability to perform functional tasks after reintroduction to a gravitational environment. Current flight exercise countermeasures are not fully protective of cardiovascular, muscle and bone health. There is a need to refine and optimize countermeasures to mitigate health risks associated with long-term space missions.","[{""submissionId"":20120000718,""id"":""404df04db1954eb9996a6e6353cecd05"",""publicationDate"":""2012-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120000718

Alterations in autonomic nervous system and neuromuscular function after spaceflight might contribute to this problem. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to microgravity impairs autonomic neural control of sympathetic outflow in response to peripheral afferent stimulation produced by handgrip and a cold pressor test in humans. We studied five astronauts approximately 72 and 23 days before, and on landing day after the 16 day Neurolab (STS-90) space shuttle mission, and four of the astronauts during flight (day 12 or 13). Heart rate, arterial pressure and peroneal muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) were recorded before and during static handgrip sustained to fatigue at 40 % of maximum voluntary contraction, followed by 2 min of circulatory arrest pre-, in- and post-flight. The cold pressor test was applied only before (five astronauts) and during flight (day 12 or 13, four astronauts). Mean (+/- S.E.M.) baseline heart rates and arterial pressures were similar among pre-, in- and post-flight measurements. At the same relative fatiguing force, the peak systolic pressure and mean arterial pressure during static handgrip were not different before, during and after spaceflight. The peak diastolic pressure tended to be higher post- than pre-flight (112 +/- 6 vs. 99 +/- 5 mmHg, P = 0.088). Contraction-induced rises in heart rate were similar pre-, in- and post-flight. MSNA was higher post-flight in all subjects before static handgrip (26 +/- 4 post- vs. 15 +/- 4 bursts min(-1) pre-flight, P = 0.017). Contraction-evoked peak MSNA responses were not different before, during, and after spaceflight (41 +/- 4, 38 +/- 5 and 46 +/- 6 bursts min(-1), all P > 0.05). MSNA during post-handgrip circulatory arrest was higher post- than pre- or in-flight (41 +/- 1 vs. 33 +/- 3 and 30 +/- 5 bursts min(-1), P = 0.038 and 0.036). Similarly, responses of MSNA and blood pressure to the cold pressor test were well maintained in-flight. We conclude that modulation of muscle sympathetic neural outflow by muscle metaboreceptors and skin nociceptors is preserved during short duration spaceflight.","[{""volume"":""544"",""submissionId"":20040088044,""issue"":""Pt 2"",""issn"":""0022-3751"",""id"":""ee97de11ac9c4f67bc41d7ca007d7e21"",""publicationName"":""The Journal of physiology"",""publicationDate"":""2002-10-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088044

20000020542,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Cardiovascular Session Summary,"[""Raven, Peter"",""Schneider, Sue""]","It was apparent that the bed-rest and spaceflight data indicated that decreases in plasma volume and cardiac atrophy along with cardiac remodeling were fundamental changes which predisposed many astronauts to post flight orthostatic intolerance. Despite the recently acquired in-flight and post-flight muscle sympathetic nerve activity findings suggesting that the sympathetic nerve responses were appropriate there remains significant contrary data from bed-rest studies, post- flight stand tests and hind-limb unweighted rat studies that suggest that the vasoconstrictive responses were compromised at least insufficient in susceptible individuals. The key issues raised is whether a diminished increase in sympathetic activity from baseline without changes in 254 First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators'Workshop Cardiovascular peak response or receptor adaptations is an abnormal response or is an individual variance of response to the accentuated decrease in stroke volume. Data relating autonomic neural control of heart rate were presented to suggest that the vagal and sympathetic control of heart rate was attenuated. Also, bed-rest and space flight induced attenuated baroreflex control of heart rate was shown to be restored to pre-bedrest function by one bout of maximal dynamic exercise. However, these data were confounded by relying on the use of R-R interval as a measure of efferent responses of the baroreflex during a condition in which the baseline heart rate was changed. Clearly the idea that the autonomic control of heart rate may be changed by microgravity needs further investigation. This direction is suggested despite the fact that in the triple product (HR x SV x TPR = MAP) assessment of the regulation of arterial blood pressure during orthostasis the role of the HR reflex may be less influential than that associated. with cardiac atrophy (SV changes) and aberrant sympathetic vasoconstriction (resistance) changes. Although sympathetic nerve activity responses in-flight and post-flight on neurolab appeared appropriate, enough bed-rest and post-flight stand test data, along with animal model data suggest that vasoconstriction was compromised. The mechanism of this compromised vasoconstriction needs to be delineated. Other major findings concerning microgravity and physiological regulatory systems are that: I . Thermoregulatory adaptation appear to suggest some decrements in the control of cutaneous vasodilation and sweating; 2. Calcium resorption and dietary calcium need to be defined for differing durations of spaceflight, especially as the effects of excess calcium on vasomotor function appears to be detrimental; 3. Neurohumoral mechanisms of microgravity induced changes in neural function and the regulation of plasma volume and total body water, bone resorption and autonomic neural control of the circulation need further delineation; 4. As performance of work tasks become prolonged, the mechanisms of blood pressure regulation in microgravity needs to be used in the recovery period from prolonged work tasks.","[{""submissionId"":20000020542,""id"":""00559f006ebf41f4ab21cf8897eb34f7"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""},{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000020542
20205004970,CONTRACTOR_OR_GRANTEE_REPORT,Development and Comparison of an Artificial Gravity Concept for Human Spaceflight,"[""Alice Elberfeld""]","This Internship served as a resource to find specific research about the many facets of artificial gravity. With three main areas to be addressed in detail: the negative health effects of microgravity and how current mitigation methods fall short, the knowns and unknowns of artificial gravity as a countermeasure, and past artificial gravity habitat concepts. This report primarily focuses on the negative health effects of microgravity and how current mitigation methods fall short. Through NASA resources such as the NTRS, and external sources such as the AIAA, research papers were gathered that were pertinent to the topic. Each paper was uploaded to a NASA SharePoint and abstracts were drafted to highlight the important information. The expected results were to build a library of easily accessible information that would allow for Ryan Joyce and Gabe Merrill to easily get up to speed on relevant information. This process should allow for a faster period of understanding with high relevancy material. The ability to quickly reference data will help to build an informed and detailed case for any future proposals on artificial gravity. This also prevents the need to spend many hours searching for relevant documentation, allowing for more time to be dedicated to the creation process. The project has successfully met expectations and is continuing to add pertinent documentation. Current research shows great potential for artificial gravity as a countermeasure on long duration missions. The gravity like forces created in an artificial gravity ship could help to prevent serious problems such as muscle loss, bone fractures, vision loss due to increased intracranial pressure, and would allow for transition to other gravity environments with little to no recovery period. These conditions are highly favorable for long duration missions as current mitigation methods have yet to be proven beyond one year in space and often only slow symptoms instead of preventing them.","[{""submissionId"":20205004970,""id"":""30a785e965fa4a589280be5356c28586"",""publicationDate"":""2020-08-07T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20205004970,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""68603dff261e5d2d9de5a550aa9e6b30"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Langley Research Center"",""location"":""Hampton, Virginia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""5c01af80ecd74948b7b7af630e0417e2"",""id"":""54992319ae7e44e88c8cc1982f23b350""}],""name"":""Summer Interns 2020 Exit Deliverable Presentations"",""location"":""Online"",""id"":""5c01af80ecd74948b7b7af630e0417e2"",""startDate"":""2020-07-31T04:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNX15AI20H""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205004970
20190033192,PRESENTATION,Investigating Neuro-Consequences of Spaceflight Using Drosophila Melanogaster,"[""Iyer, Janani""]","Research on human acclimation to spaceflight, including the recent NASA's Twin Study, reports complex effects of the spaceflight environment on health, with both acute and prolonged changes in multiple tissues. Spaceflight includes multiple factors such as microgravity, ionizing radiation, physiological stress, and disrupted circadian rhythms, that have been shown to contribute to pathophysiological responses that target immunity, bone and muscle integrity, cardiovascular and nervous systems. In this study, we used a well-established spaceflight model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to assess spaceflight-associated changes on the nervous system. With 75% disease gene orthology to humans, short generation time, large sample size and ease of genetic, neuronal and behavioral studies, Drosophila is an excellent model to study nervous system dysfunction. Here, we present results from MVP-Fly-01 spaceflight mission that was launched on SpaceX CRS-14. The MVP hardware (developed by Techshot) used in this mission enabled us to have an in-flight 1g centrifuge, to distinguish the changes resulting from gravity versus those induced by other environmental factors associated with spaceflight. We observe behavioral impairments (p<0.001) and synaptic deficits, including decreased synaptic connections (p<0.05), in 3rd instar larvae which were developed in space. Furthermore, space-grown microgravity adults show a decrease in neuronal (p<0.05) and dendritic field (p<0.01) in adult brains coupled with an increased number of apoptotic cells (p<0.001) compared to in-flight 1g controls, suggesting increased neuronal loss under spaceflight conditions. In summary, we observe that altered gravity leads to gross neurological deficits. To better understand the long-term effects of spaceflight on the nervous system, longitudinal and multigenerational changes were also identified. This study will help elucidate the different approaches to prevent nervous system dysfunction in astronauts during spaceflight, while also contributing to a better understanding of the pathways that are related to some CNS disorders on Earth.","[{""submissionId"":20190033192,""id"":""7c5460005f554624b20ca428fc88fef8"",""publicationDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190033192,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""a96a5035dbd240fa8611c37fd1675b6a""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190033192,""endDate"":""2019-11-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""5e80796db7c84e2eada24484f559aee0"",""id"":""276049a0bf6549078f824825eb92eed1""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""5e80796db7c84e2eada24484f559aee0"",""startDate"":""2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190033192

Holton is designed to produce a headward shift of fluid and unload the hindlimbs in rodents, causing changes in bone and muscle similar to those in animals and humans exposed to spaceflight. While the Holton suspension system simulates many of the conditions observed in the spaceflight animal, it does not provide for the collection of urine and feces needed to monitor some metabolic activities. As a result, only limited information has been gathered on the nutritional status, and the gastrointestinal and renal function of animals using that model. Although commercial metabolic cages are available, they are usually cylindrical and require a centrally located suspension system and thus, do not readily permit movement of the rats. The limited floor space of commercial cages may affect comparisons with studies using the Holton model which has more than twice the living space of most commercially available cages. To take advantage of the extra living space and extensive data base that has been developed with the Holton model, Holton's cage was modified to make urine and fecal collections possible.","[{""submissionId"":19950004416,""id"":""a8e17c0096104703bb59156c354c3c3b"",""publicationDate"":""1994-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""RTOP 199-26-12-02""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19950004416

A number of questions remain to be answered. At a time when plasma volume and extracellular fluid volume are contracted and salt and water intake is unrestricted. ADH does not correct the volume deficit and serum sodium decreases. Change in secretion or activity of a natriuretic factor during spaceflight is one possible explanation. Recent identification of a polypeptide hormone produced in cardiac muscle cells which is natiuretic, is hypotensive, and has an inhibitory effect on renin and aldosterone secretion has renewed interest in the role of a natriuretic factor. The role of this atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in both long- and short-term variation in extracellular volumes and in the inability of the kidney to bring about an escape from the sodium-retaining state accompanying chronic cardiac dysfunction makes it reasonable to look for a role of ANF in the regulation of sodium during exposure to microgravity. Prostaglandin-E is another hormone that may antagonize the action of ADH. Assays of these hormones will be performed on samples from crew members in the future.","[{""submissionId"":19910016264,""id"":""4f8f5255762949a0806e556748065441"",""publicationName"":""Spacelab Life Sciences 1: Reprints of Background Life Sciences Publications"",""publicationDate"":""1991-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19910016264

R.""]","Artificial gravity paradigms may offer effective, efficient, multi-system protection from the untoward effects of adaptation to the microgravity of space or the hypogravity of planetary surfaces. Intermittent artificial gravity (AG) produced by a horizontal short-radius centrifuge (SRC) has recently been utilized on human test subjects deconditioned by bed rest. This presentation will review preliminary results of a 41 day study conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX bed rest facility. During the first eleven days of the protocol, subjects were ambulatory, but confined to the facility. They began a carefully controlled diet, and participated in multiple baseline tests of bone, muscle, cardiovascular, sensory-motor, immunological, and psychological function. On the twelfth day, subjects entered the bed rest phase of the study, during which they were confined to strict 6deg head down tilt bed rest for 21 days. Beginning 24 hrs into this period, treatment subjects received one hour daily exposures to artificial gravity which was produced by spinning the subjects on a 3.0 m radius SRC. They were oriented radially in the supine position so that the centrifugal force was aligned with their long body axis, and while spinning, they ""stood"" on a force plate, supporting the centrifugal loading (2.5 g at the feet, 1.0 g at the heart). The subject station allowed free translation over approximately 10 cm to ensure full loading of the lower extremities and to allow for anti-orthostatic muscle contractions. Control subjects were positioned on the centrifuge but did not spin. Following the bed rest phase, subjects were allowed to ambulate again, but remained within the facility for an additional 9 days and participated in multiple follow-up tests of physiological function.","[{""submissionId"":20060051791,""id"":""76c09e50fcff4c3ea277d5b93aabcd2b"",""publicationDate"":""2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20060051791,""endDate"":""2006-11-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology Conference"",""location"":""Arlington, VA"",""id"":""cb5f2fcff5ea4e79a50e9c6b71fb212e"",""startDate"":""2006-11-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20060051791

Body fluid volumes, electrolyte levels, and bone and muscle undergo changes as the human body adapts to the weightless environment. Changes in the urinary biochemistry occur as early as flight day 3-4 in the short duration Shuttle crewmembers. Significant decreases were observed both in fluid intake and urinary output. Other significant changes were observed in the urinary pH, calcium, potassium and uric acid levels. During Shuttle missions, the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation increased early in the flight, continued at elevated levels throughout the flight and remained in the increased risk range on landing day. The calcium phosphate risk was significantly increased early in-flight and remained significantly elevated throughout the remainder of the mission. Results from the long duration Shuttle-Mir missions followed a similar trend. Most long duration crewmembers demonstrated increased urinary calcium levels despite lower dietary calcium intake. Fluid intake and urine volumes were significantly lower during the flight than during the preflight. The calcium oxalate risk was increased relative to the preflight levels during the early in-flight period and continued in the elevated risk range for the remainder of the space flight and through two weeks postflight. Calcium phosphate risk for these long duration crewmembers increased during flight and remained in the increased risk range throughout the flight and following landing. The complexity, expense and visibility of the human space program require that every effort be made to protect the health of the crewmembers and ensure the success of the mission. Results from our early investigations clearly indicate that exposure to the microgravity environment of space significantly increases the risk of renal stone formation. The early studies have indicated specific avenues for development of countermeasures for the increased renal stone risk observed during and following space flight. Increased hydration and implementation of pharmacological countermeasures are being tested for their efficacy in mitigating the in-flight risk of renal stones. Maintaining the health and well-being of crewmembers during space flight requires a means of minimizing potential detrimental health effects of microgravity. The formation of a renal stone during flight obviously has severe consequences for the affected crewmember as well as the success of the mission.","[{""submissionId"":20100033500,""id"":""353c4dfcbdf9475bb942a3f954755097"",""publicationDate"":""2001-10-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20100033500,""name"":""American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"",""location"":""United States"",""id"":""ec31d54887804746adcfb3f47b8c3039""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100033500
20000073392,REPRINT,Neuroendocrine and Immune System Responses with Spaceflights,"[""Tipton, Charles M."",""Greenleaf, John E."",""Jackson, Catherine G. R.""]","Despite the fact that the first human was in space during 1961 and individuals have existed in a microgravity environment for more than a year, there are limited spaceflight data available on the responses of the neuroendocrine and immune systems. Because of mutual interactions between these respective integrative systems, it is inappropriate to assume that the responses of one have no impact on functions of the other. Blood and plasma volume consistently decrease with spaceflight; hence, blood endocrine and immune constituents will be modified by both gravitational and measurement influences. The majority of the in-flight data relates to endocrine responses that influence fluids and electrolytes during the first month in space. Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), aldo-sterone. and anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) appear to be elevated with little change in the atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP). Flight results longer than 60 d show increased ADH variability with elevations in angiotensin and cortisol. Although post-flight results are influenced by reentry and recovery events, ACTH and ADH appear to be consistently elevated with variable results being reported for the other hormones. Limited in-flight data on insulin and growth hormone levels suggest they are not elevated to counteract the loss in muscle mass. Post-flight results from short- and long-term flights indicate that thyroxine and insulin are increased while growth hormone exhibits minimal change. In-flight parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are variable for several weeks after which they remain elevated. Post-flight PTH was increased on missions that lasted either 7 or 237 d, whereas calcitonin concentrations were increased after 1 wk but decreased after longer flights. Leukocytes are elevated in flights of various durations because of an increase in neutrophils. The majority of post-flight data indicates immunoglobulin concentrations are not significantly changed from pre-flight measurements. However, the numbers of T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells are decreased with post-flight conditions. Of the lymphokines, interleukin-2 production, lymphocyte responsiveness, and the activity of natural killer cells are consistently reduced post-flight. Limited head-down tilt (HDT) data suggest it is an effective simulation model for microgravity investigations. Neuroendocrine and pharmacological countermeasures are virtually nonexistent arid should become high priority items for future research. Although exercise has the potential to be an effective countermeasure for various neuroen-docrine-immune responses in microgravity, this concept must be tested before flights to Mars are scheduled.","[{""submissionId"":20000073392,""issn"":""0195-9131"",""publisher"":""American College of Sports Medicine"",""id"":""f4b0452541de4d7d97420702c2f9adde"",""publicationName"":""Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise"",""publicationDate"":""1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000073392
20190030357,PRESENTATION,Systemic Alterations with Spaceflight Associated Health Risks Originating from Both Circulating miRNAs and Mitochondrial Biology,"[""Beheshti, Afshin""]","The many known health risks currently associated with space travel include increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, central nervous system related diseases, muscle degeneration, and changes with host-gut microbiome interactions that can have profound impact with these and other health risks. The majority of the risk from space travel stem of the two components of the space environment which are microgravity and radiation. Two specific systemic effects have been uncovered by us to impact the body as a whole due to the space environment. One factor is related from our earlier work (Beheshti et al, PLOS One, 2018), we predicted that there is a systemic component of the host that causes general increased health risks due to spaceflight driven by a circulating microRNA (miRNA) signature consisting of 13 miRNAs that directly regulates both p53 and TGF1. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules with a negative and post-transcriptional regulation on gene expression) are increasingly recognized as major systemic regulators of responses to stressors, including microgravity, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. In addition, due to the size and stability of miRNAs, it is known that miRNAs can circulate throughout the body and have been found in the majority of the bodily fluids including blood, urine, saliva, and tears. Here, we start to dissect the actual impact of this miRNA signature on both the radiation and microgravity components and prove that this miRNA signature actually exists in the circulation of a host. The other systemic factor we uncovered was the impact the mitochondria on the whole body due to spaceflight. We hypothesize that spaceflight may promote a physiologic response driven by systemic mitochondria pathways leading to metabolic disorder stemming from the liver and directly impacting other organs and tissues. A systems biology method was implemented utilizing GeneLab datasets that involved in vitro experiments performed at the low Earth orbit, in vivo experiments involving mice flown to space, and finally human physiological data from astronauts. A comprehensive multi-omics approach was implemented which involved correlating transcriptomic analysis with proteomics, metabolomics, and methylation analysis. This approach led us to confirm our hypothesis that a systemic mitochondrial driven response is responsible for increasing potential health risk and is conserved from the in vitro studies, to the in vivo studies, and finally confirmed in astronauts.","[{""submissionId"":20190030357,""id"":""029a6220eca64030bcd65d1849c42d28"",""publicationDate"":""2019-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190030357

M."",""Gresser, A. L."",""Sato, Kevin Y."",""Taylor, Elizabeth M.""]","Laboratory strains of mice and rat are widely used to study mammalian responses to stimulus, and both have been studied under a variety of gravity conditions, including space flight. We compared results obtained from exposure to spaceflight and microgravity, hyper gravity via centrifugation, earth gravity, and models of simulated partial gravity (hind-limb unloading and partial weight bearing treatments). We examined the reported changes in survival, body mass, circadian rhythm (body temperature and activity levels), behavior, bone, muscle, immune, cardio-vasculature, vestibular, reproduction and neonate survival, microbiome, and the visual system. Not all categories have published data for both species, some have limited data, and there are variations in experiment design that allow for only relative comparisons to be considered. The data reveal species differences in both the level of gravity required to obtain a response, degree of response, and in temporal expression of responses. Examination of the data across the gravity levels allows consideration of the hypothesis that gravitational responses follow a continuum, and organ specific differences are noted. In summary, we present advantages and caveats of each model system as pertains to gravitational biology research and identify gaps in our knowledge of how these mammals respond to gravity.","[{""submissionId"":20180002559,""id"":""8dabaa304c16417d8033d5d6736bad46"",""publicationDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20180002559,""endDate"":""2018-01-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b32837228621498f924119d72949c653"",""id"":""cf8307009ca24dabb0bd3844effe2249""}],""name"":""2018 NASA Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""b32837228621498f924119d72949c653"",""startDate"":""2018-01-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180002559
20070025042,ABSTRACT,Artificial Gravity: Effects on Bone Turnover,"[""Heer, M."",""Zwart, S /R."",""Baecker, N."",""Smith, S. M.""]","The impact of microgravity on the human body is a significant concern for space travelers. Since mechanical loading is a main reason for bone loss, artificial gravity might be an effective countermeasure to the effects of microgravity. In a 21-day 6 head-down tilt bed rest (HDBR) pilot study carried out by NASA, USA, the utility of artificial gravity (AG) as a countermeasure to immobilization-induced bone loss was tested. Blood and urine were collected before, during, and after bed rest for bone marker determinations. Bone mineral density was determined by DXA and pQCT before and after bed rest. Urinary excretion of bone resorption markers (n-telopeptide and helical peptide) were increased from pre-bed rest, but there was no difference between the control and the AG group. The same was true for serum c-telopeptide measurements. Bone formation markers were affected by bed rest and artificial gravity. While bone-specific alkaline phosphatase tended to be lower in the AG group during bed rest (p = 0.08), PINP, another bone formation marker, was significantly lower in AG subjects than CN before and during bed rest. PINP was lower during bed rest in both groups. For comparison, artificial gravity combined with ergometric exercise was tested in a 14-day HDBR study carried out in Japan (Iwase et al. J Grav Physiol 2004). In that study, an exercise regime combined with AG was able to significantly mitigate the bed rest-induced increase in the bone resorption marker deoxypyridinoline. While further study is required to more clearly differentiate bone and muscle effects, these initial data demonstrate the potential effectiveness of short-radius, intermittent AG as a countermeasure to the bone deconditioning that occurs during bed rest and spaceflight. Future studies will need to optimize not only the AG prescription (intensity and duration), but will likely need to include the use of exercise or other combined treatments.","[{""submissionId"":20070025042,""id"":""83e756d2a4be4731a67f531ad2e29c94"",""publicationDate"":""2007-09-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Germany"",""submissionId"":20070025042,""endDate"":""2007-09-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Medicine and Mobility"",""location"":""Cologne"",""id"":""5c8c7383017c40d3a2ccb72a926dc12d"",""startDate"":""2007-09-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070025042
20070023306,OTHER,Preliminary Assessment of Artificial Gravity Impacts to Deep-Space Vehicle Design,"[""Joosten, B. Kent""]","Even after more than thirty years of scientific investigation, serious concerns regarding human physiological effects of long-duration microgravity exposure remain. These include loss of bone mineral density, skeletal muscle atrophy, and orthostatic hypertension, among others. In particular, ""Safe Passage: Astronaut Care for Exploration Missions,"" states ""loss of bone density, which apparently occurs at a rate of 1% per month in microgravity, is relatively manageable on the short-duration missions of the space shuttle, but it becomes problematic on the ISS [International Space Station]. ...If this loss is not mitigated, interplanetary missions will be impossible."" While extensive investigations into potential countermeasures are planned on the ISS, the delay in attaining full crew complement and onboard facilities, and the potential for extending crews tours of duty threaten the timely (< 20 years!) accumulation of sufficient data for countermeasures formulation. Indeed, there is no guarantee that even with the data, a practical or sufficiently robust set of countermeasures will be forthcoming. Providing an artificial gravity (AG) environment by crew centrifugation aboard deep-space human exploration vehicles, long a staple technique of science fiction, has received surprisingly limited engineering assessment. This is most likely due to a number of factors: the lack of definitive design requirements, especially acceptable artificial gravity levels and rotation rates, the perception of high vehicle mass and performance penalties, the incompatibility of resulting vehicle configurations with space propulsion options (i.e., aerocapture), the perception of complications associated with de-spun components such as antennae and photovoltaic arrays, and the expectation of effective crew micro-gravity countermeasures. These perception and concerns may have been overstated, or may be acceptable alternatives to countermeasures of limited efficacy. This study was undertaken as an initial step to try to understand the implications of and potential solutions to incorporating artificial gravity in the design of human deep-space exploration vehicles. Of prime interest will be the mass penalties incurred by incorporating AG, along with any mission performance degradation.","[{""submissionId"":20070023306,""id"":""a35e21e71c4a44bf96e077bc93431c90"",""publicationDate"":""2007-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""WBS 604746.04.01""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070023306
20200001516,POSTER,The Role of Nuclear Cytoskeleton in the Osteocytic Response to Simulated Weightlessness,"[""Touchstone, Hallie"",""Uzer, Gunes"",""Alwood, Joshua S."",""Schreurs, Ann-Sofie""]","While in space, astronauts exercise frequently to combat bone and muscle loss due to weightlessness. This loss in bone can lead to serious health problems, such as increased fracture risk. Osteocytes are known to play a vital role in bone resorption and formation. It is also theorized that osteocytes act as the mechanosensors of bone, detecting mechanical stimulus and relaying these signals to surrounding cells. Previous research suggests that, during space flight, osteocytes exhibit matrix remodeling and resorption capabilities (osteocytic osteolysis) leading to an enlargement of the lacunae and contributing to overall bone degradation. The intercellular causes of these changes has not yet been determined. LINC or Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton is a protein complex that forms a connection between the nucleus and cytoskeleton. LINC serves as a way to transmit mechanical signals to the nucleus and is also involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling via KASH proteins (Nesprin -1 and Nesprin -2). Wnt signaling in osteocytes assists with bone homeostasis and perturbed Wnt signaling can lead to bone loss. This suggests that LINC may contribute to the bone diminishing effects of microgravity. Therefore, we hypothesize that the disruption of LINC or LINC components by simulated microgravity (using the hindlimb unloading model, HU) affects Wnt signaling in osteocytes affecting bone formation and leading to increased osteocyte lacunar size. To test these hypotheses, we plan to conduct an animal study using 16 week old male mice (n6group). The mice will undergo HU for up to 7 days. After the desired time point, we will utilize quantitative real-time PCR techniques to determine the changes in gene expression of seven LINC complex genes (Sun -1, Sun -2, Nesprin -1, Nesprin -2, Lamin AC, Lamin B, and Emerin) and genes related to bone formation and osteocyte signaling. To determine changes osteocytic remodeling activity we will immunostain for osteocyte markers (Dmp-1 and Sost) and osteolysis markers (TRAP, MMPs) and measure lacunar size.","[{""submissionId"":20200001516,""id"":""19323c71ef704850b71fa6db6442cbdd"",""publicationDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20200001516,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""5fbf0ee6386c48238466c1d8e1866b6d""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20200001516,""endDate"":""2017-10-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9eb947eeb946460d9bb8d193257a511e"",""id"":""a6f652f1e6aa45389fd18e01831fc449""}],""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Seattle, WA"",""id"":""9eb947eeb946460d9bb8d193257a511e"",""startDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20200001516
20000085958,ABSTRACT,Space Medicine: A Surgeon's Perspective,"[""Dawson, David L.""]","For the first four decades of human space flight NASA's priorities in life sciences and medical programs have been preventative medicine (astronaut selection and training); assessment of the physiologic effects of microgravity and other unique aspects of space flight, implementation of countermeasures to protect against adverse effects, and amelioration of these adverse effects. Because most of the U.S. space flight experience has been on short duration missions, the need for medical and diagnostic treatment capabilities have been limited.The first long-term crews will arrive on the International Space Station (ISS) in early 2000. This will usher in a new era, an era of sustained human presence in Low Earth Orbit. One of the principal purposes of the ISS program is to increase the knowledge of the effects of long duration space flight on humans, a pre-requisite to future exploration class missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (e.g., a return to the Moon or an exploration of Mars). Areas of particular interest include protection from radiation, muscle atrophy, bone loss, cardiovascular alterations, immune dysfunction, adverse psychological response to hazards and confinement, and neurovestibular alterations. In addition, long duration space flight requires the development of autonomous medical care capabilities, as the distances involved eliminate the possibility of real-time telemedicine or robotic intervention, and prevent a mission abort and a rapid return to Earth. The objectives of this presentation include: 1. A description of the International Space Station project, including its research facilities and on-orbit medical capabilities; 2. An overview of the physiological and medical problems associated with microgravity in space flight; 3. A review of NASA's biomedical research priorities and ongoing work to develop clinical care capabilities for space flight crews (including surgical interventions) and; 4.

For example, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy may be induced physiologically (via exercise training) or pathologically (via hypertension or valvular heart disease). If hypertension is treated, LV hypertrophy regresses, suggesting a sensitivity to LV work. However, whether physical inactivity in nonathletic populations causes adaptive changes in LV mass or even frank atrophy is not clear. We exposed previously sedentary men to 6 (n = 5) and 12 (n = 3) wk of horizontal bed rest. LV and right ventricular (RV) mass and end-diastolic volume were measured using cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 2, 6, and 12 wk of bed rest; five healthy men were also studied before and after at least 6 wk of routine daily activities as controls. In addition, four astronauts were exposed to the complete elimination of hydrostatic gradients during a spaceflight of 10 days. During bed rest, LV mass decreased by 8.0 +/- 2.2% (P = 0.005) after 6 wk with an additional atrophy of 7.6 +/- 2.3% in the subjects who remained in bed for 12 wk; there was no change in LV mass for the control subjects (153.0 +/- 12.2 vs. 153.4 +/- 12.1 g, P = 0.81). Mean wall thickness decreased (4 +/- 2.5%, P = 0.01) after 6 wk of bed rest associated with the decrease in LV mass, suggesting a physiological remodeling with respect to altered load. LV end-diastolic volume decreased by 14 +/- 1.7% (P = 0.002) after 2 wk of bed rest and changed minimally thereafter. After 6 wk of bed rest, RV free wall mass decreased by 10 +/- 2.7% (P = 0.06) and RV end-diastolic volume by 16 +/- 7.9% (P = 0.06). After spaceflight, LV mass decreased by 12 +/- 6.9% (P = 0.07). In conclusion, cardiac atrophy occurs during prolonged (6 wk) horizontal bed rest and may also occur after short-term spaceflight. We suggest that cardiac atrophy is due to a physiological adaptation to reduced myocardial load and work in real or simulated microgravity and demonstrates the plasticity of cardiac muscle under different loading conditions.","[{""volume"":""91"",""submissionId"":20040112365,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""8750-7587"",""id"":""2558a31599574445a5689f7840c63874"",""publicationName"":""Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. :  1985)"",""publicationDate"":""2001-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""MO1-RR-00633""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040112365

Postflight observations of alterations in nutritional status for several nutrients are troubling, and we require the ability to monitor the status of these nutrients during flight to determine if there is a specific impetus or timeframe for these changes. In addition to the monitoring of crew nutritional status during flight, in-flight sample collection would allow better assessment of countermeasure effectiveness. SMO 016E is also designed to expand the current medical requirement for nutritional assessment (MR016L) to include additional normative markers for assessing crew health and countermeasure effectiveness. Additional markers of bone metabolism will be measured to better monitor bone health and the effectiveness of countermeasures to prevent bone resorption. New markers of oxidative damage will be measured to better assess the type of oxidative insults that occur during space flight. The array of nutritional assessment parameters will be expanded to include parameters that will allow us to better understand changes in folate and vitamin B6 status, and related cardiovascular risk factors during and after flight. Additionally, stress hormones and hormones that affect bone and muscle metabolism will also be measured. This additional assessment will allow us to better monitor the health of crew members and make more accurate recommendations for their rehabilitation. Several nutritional assessment parameters are altered at landing, but it is not known how long these changes persist. We extended the current protocol to include an additional postflight blood and urine sample collection 30 days after landing. Data are being collected before, during, and after flight. These data will provide a complete survey of how nutritional status and related systems are affected by space flight. Analyzing the data will help us to define nutritional requirements for long-duration missions.

B."",""Wood, S.""]","Astronauts experience alterations in multiple physiological systems due to exposure to the microgravity conditions of space flight. These physiological changes include sensorimotor disturbances, cardiovascular deconditioning and loss of muscle mass and strength. These changes might affect the ability of crewmembers to perform critical mission tasks immediately after landing on lunar and Martian surfaces. To date, changes in functional performance have not been systematically studied or correlated with physiological changes. To understand how changes in physiological function impact functional performance an interdisciplinary pre/postflight testing regimen (Functional Task Test, FTT) has been developed that systematically evaluates both astronaut postflight functional performance and related physiological changes. The overall objective of the FTT is to identify the key underlying physiological factors that contribute to performance of functional tests that are representative of critical mission tasks. This study will identify which physiological systems contribute the most to impaired performance on each functional test. This will allow us to identify the physiological systems that play the largest role in decrement in functional performance. Using this information we can then design and implement countermeasures that specifically target the physiological systems most responsible for the altered functional performance associated with space flight. The functional test battery was designed to address high priority tasks identified by the Constellation program as critical for mission success. The set of functional tests making up the FTT include the: 1) Seat Egress and Walk Test, 2) Ladder Climb Test, 3) Recovery from Fall/Stand Test, 4) Rock Translation Test, 5) Jump Down Test, 6) Torque Generation Test, and 7) Construction Activity Board Test.

20190025476,PRESENTATION,The Effects of CDKN1a/p21 on Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Function During Long Duration Spaceflight,"[""Stimpel, Olivia "",""Almeida, Eduardo A. C."",""Blaber, Elizabeth A."",""Cheng-Campbell, Margareth Ann"",""Jonscher, Karen"",""Pecaut, Michael"",""Schrepfer, Sonja""]","Spaceflight factors, such as microgravity and space radiation, are known to put astronauts at risk for negative effects to their tissue regeneration and degenerative conditions. On our previous spaceflight research, we found that long duration spaceflight produced increased oxidative stress and activation of the inflammatory response as a major contributor to physiological changes, including alterations to the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems, metabolism, and the liver. Proliferation, apoptosis, and ion-channel remodeling of vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as endothelial inflammation, and nitric oxide synthase-nitric oxide system regulation have been shown by spaceflight and simulated spaceflight projects. CDKN1ap21 is a regulatory gene for tissue regeneration and also plays an important role in upregulating oxidative stress caused by radiation. In further research, we have also determined CDKN1ap21 to be overexpressed during spaceflight. When knocked out in mice, however, it protects against unloading-induced changes to the morphology and physiology of carotid arteries. In this proposal, we seek to test a potential dietary countermeasure to down-regulate CDKN1ap21 in the mice and protect against oxidative stress in the rodents. Specifically, we will expose both Wildtype and CDKN1ap21-null mice to hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative stress and observe the molecular mechanisms in which a dietary supplement protects vascular smooth muscle cells against the consequences of the apoptotic environment within Wildtype mice versus the, hypothetically, sound physiology of CDKN1ap21-null mice. The successful completion of this experiment will conclusively determine accuracy of a dietary supplement as a CDKN1ap21 suppressor. This will provide a new perspective on the problem of increased oxidative stress developing into cardiovascular disease as a result of long-term space flight. This research will address the Human Research Plan Roadmaps Risk of Cardiac Rhythm Problems including CV-8, the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Other Degenerative Tissue Effects from Radiation Exposure including Degen-6 and Degen-7, and the Risk of Adverse Health Event from Radiation Exposure including IM-8. Additionally, this research will address Space Biology Research Plans questions SBP CMB-1, SBP CMB-3, and SB AN-2.","[{""submissionId"":20190025476,""id"":""4d591065725c41c38e5a2009069d897d"",""publicationDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20190025476,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""5fa9414392964908b4b13a9e7ecdaba3""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190025476,""endDate"":""2017-10-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f4d97b9ad94443129e7bd66b41eb24a5"",""id"":""c33648aa522349159d2159d523359de6""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Seattle, WA"",""id"":""f4d97b9ad94443129e7bd66b41eb24a5"",""startDate"":""2017-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA16BD14C"",""NNX15AG98A""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Life Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20190027604,""title"":""Current Status of Shock Layer Radiation Studies for Planetary Probes""},{""id"":20190027605,""title"":""The Effects of CDKN1a/p21 on Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Function During Long Duration Spaceflight""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190025476
19900017154,OTHER,Experiment K-6-17. Structural changes and cell turnover in the rats small intestine induced by spaceflight,"[""Phillips, R. W."",""Sawyer, H. R."",""Smirnov, K. V.""]","The purpose of this project was to test the hypothesis that the generalized, whole body decrease in synthetic activity associated with microgravity conditions of space flight as evidenced by negative nitrogen balance and muscle atrophy (Nicogossian and Parker, 1982; Oganov, 1981), as well as inhibited lymphocyte proliferation (Bechler and Cogoli, 1986), would be evident in cells characterized by a rapid rate of turnover. As a model, researchers chose to study the turnover of mucosal cells lining the jejunum of the small intestine, since these cells are among the most rapidly proliferating in the body. Under normal conditions, epithelial cells that line the small intestine are continually produced in the crypts of Lieberkuhn. These cells migrate out of the crypts onto intestinal villi, are progressively pushed up the villus as new crypt cells are formed, and ultimately reach the tip of villi where they are then descquamated. In rats, the entire process, from initial proliferation in crypts to desquamation, takes approximately 2 days (Cairnie et al., 1965; Lipkin, 1973). In this study, researchers determined the mitotic index for mucosal cells lining the proximal, middle, and distal regions of the jejunum in rats from three treatment groups (synchronous control, vivarium control and flight), and measured the depth of the crypts of Lieberkuhn and the length of villi present in each of the three jejunal regions sampled.","[{""submissionId"":19900017154,""id"":""4a90e191d63f4ad08d5f194d43a2f74b"",""publicationName"":""NASA, Ames Research Center, The US Experiments Flown on the Soviet Biosatellite Cosmos 1887"",""publicationDate"":""1990-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19900017154

At 2.5-microm sarcomere length, thick filament density is approximately 1,012 filaments/microm(2) in all fiber types and unchanged by spaceflight. In preflight aldehyde-fixed biopsies, gastrocnemius fibers possess higher percentages (approximately 23%) of short thin filaments than soleus (9%). In type I fibers, spaceflight increases short, thin filament content from 9 to 24% in soleus and from 26 to 31% in gastrocnemius. Thick and thin filament spacing is wider at short sarcomere lengths. The Z-band lattice is also expanded, except for soleus type I fibers with presumably stiffer Z bands. Thin filament packing density correlates directly with specific tension for gastrocnemius fibers but not soleus. Thin filament density is inversely related to shortening velocity in all fibers. Thin filament structural variation contributes to the functional diversity of normal and spaceflight-unloaded muscles.","[{""volume"":""92"",""submissionId"":20040088516,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""8750-7587"",""id"":""5cd797954b3b479f828cb8bf385dff5d"",""publicationName"":""Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. :  1985)"",""publicationDate"":""2002-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""U01 NS-33472""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088516

20000020539,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Renal Stone Risk During Space Flight,"[""Whitson, Peggy A."",""Pietrzyk, Robert A."",""Sams, Clarence F."",""Pak, Charles Y. C."",""Jones, Jeffrey A.""]","Space flight produces a number of metabolic and physiological changes in the crewmembers exposed to microgravity. Following launch, body fluid volumes, electrolyte levels, and bone and muscle undergo changes as the human body adapts to the weightless environment. Changes in the urinary chemical composition may lead to the potentially serious consequences of renal stone formation. Previous data collected immediately after space flight indicate changes in the urine chemistry favoring an increased risk of calcium oxalate and uric acid stone formation (n = 323). During short term Shuttle space flights, the changes observed include increased urinary calcium and decreased urine volume, pH and citrate resulting in a greater risk for calcium oxalate and brushite stone formation (n = 6). Results from long duration Shuttle/Mir missions (n = 9) followed a similar trend and demonstrated decreased fluid intake and urine volume and increased urinary calcium resulting in a urinary environment saturated with the calcium stone-forming salts. The increased risk occurs rapidly upon exposure to microgravity, continues throughout the space flight and following landing. Dietary factors, especially fluid intake, or pharmacologic intervention can significantly influence the urinary chemical composition. Increasing fluid intake to produce a daily urine output of 2 liters/day may allow the excess salts in the urine to remain in solution, crystals formation will not occur and a renal stone will not develop. Results from long duration crewmembers (n = 2) who had urine volumes greater than 2.5 L/day minimized their risk of renal stone formation. Also, comparisons of stone-forming risk in short duration crewmembers clearly identified greater risk in those who produced less than 2 liters of urine/day. However, hydration and increased urine output does not correct the underlying calcium excretion due to bone loss and only treats the symptoms and not the cause of the increased urinary salts. Dietary modification and promising pharmacologic treatments may also be used to reduce the potential risk for renal stone formation. Potassium citrate is being used clinically to increase the urinary inhibitor levels to minimize the development of crystals and the growth of renal stones. Bisphosphonates are a class of drugs recently shown to help in patients with osteoporosis by inhibiting the loss of bones in elderly patients. This drug could potentially prevent the bone loss observed in astronauts and thereby minimize the increase in urinary calcium and reduce the risk for renal stone development. Results of NASA's renal stone risk assessment program clearly indicate that exposure to microgravity changes the urinary chemical environment such that there is an increased risk for supersaturation of stone-forming salts, including calcium oxalaie and brushite. These studies have indicated specific avenues for development of countermeasures for the increased renal stone risk observed during and following space flight. Increased hydration and implementation of pharmacologic countermeasures should largely mitigate the in-flight risk of renal stones.","[{""submissionId"":20000020539,""id"":""a3fc504e55f741dd8239295b94644d64"",""publicationName"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop"",""publicationDate"":""1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""},{""id"":20000020485,""title"":""Proceedings of the First Biennial Space Biomedical Investigators' Workshop""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000020539
20240008204,ABSTRACT,Exploration Exercise System (EES) Development,"[""Kent Lawrence Kalogera"",""Scott Jonathan Wood""]","Exploration class missions will be required to have an exercise device that is lightweight, has a small footprint, and is capable of providing enough physical stimulus and exercise variability to be an effective countermeasure against muscle and bone loss that results from the microgravity environment. Exploration exercise device prototypes should be evaluated on the ground and in-orbit for feasibility of use in microgravity for long and short duration exploration missions and efficacy of the device to maintain multi-system health and performance.

The European Enhanced Exploration Exercise Device (E4D) was selected as the exploration prototype device to be evaluated on ISS for efficacy and feasibility of use as a single multi-modality device for the exercise system for exploration missions. This effort supports the continued development, testing, and verification of E4D hardware and software, internal NASA integration (Human Health and Performance, ISS Vehicle Office, Engineering, and Flight Operations), and external integration across NASA, ESA, and the Danish Aerospace Company (DAC). Providing a feasibility and acceptability assessment from a physiological efficacy and hardware durability standpoint are critical for informing use and risk associated with use on exploration missions. Clearly defined objectives from end users, stakeholders, and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) will be tested by crewmembers during acute use sessions and long duration use of the exercise device while on ISS. This effort will include a flight study where crewmembers will be asked to exercise using only the E4D during the duration of their mission and participate in a battery of physiological testing to evaluate the efficacy. Hardware is scheduled to launch in FY25 followed by 2 years of operational use after activation and checkout. A final recommendation will be provided to the Artemis program on acceptability of the device for exploration missions.

The E4D needs a vibration isolation stabilization (VIS) system that serves as a platform for the exercise hardware to protect the vehicle from loads imparted during exercise. Exploration forward VIS systems will need to protect the vehicle and provide sufficient stabilization for the exerciser during performance of all critical exercises. These enabling capabilities need to be achieved within exploration vehicle power, thermal, mass, and volume limitations.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20240008204,""endDate"":""2024-05-16T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Mars Campaign Office""}},""meetingId"":""110ab50afb924c58a4672ec574c9eb29"",""id"":""f49765d87ca24b07899e81cb133da30f""}],""name"":""MCO Mid-Year Review"",""location"":""Mountain View, CA"",""id"":""110ab50afb924c58a4672ec574c9eb29"",""startDate"":""2024-05-14T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""251546.06.15.05.01.72.01""]",undefined,"[""Man/System Technology and Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240008204
20160006438,ABSTRACT,"Space Biophysics: Accomplishments, Trends, Challenges","[""Smith, Jeffrey D.""]","Physics and biology are inextricably linked. All the chemical and biological processes of life are dutifully bound to follow the rules and laws of physics. In space, these physical laws seem to turn on their head and biological systems, from microbes to humans, adapt and evolve in myriad ways to cope with the changed physical influences of the space environment. Gravity is the most prominent change in space that influences biology. In microgravity, the physical processes of sedimentation, density-driven convective flow, influence of surface tension and fluid pressure profoundly influence biology at the molecular and cellular level as well as at the whole-body level. Gravity sensing mechanisms are altered, structural and functional components of biology (such as bone and muscle) are reduced and changes in the way fluids and gasses behave also drive the way microbial systems and biofilms grow as well as the way plants and animals adapt. The radiation environment also effects life in space. Solar particle events and high energy cosmic radiation can cause serious damage to DNA and other biomolecules. The results can cause mutation, cellular damage or death, leading to health consequences of acute radiation damage or long-term health consequences such as increased cancer risk. Space Biophysics is the study and utilization of physical changes in space that cause changes in biological systems. The unique physical environment in space has been used successfully to grow high-quality protein crystals and 3D tissue cultures that could not be grown in the presence of unidirectional gravitational acceleration here on Earth. All biological processes that change in space have their root in a biophysical alteration due to microgravity and/or the radiation environment of space. In order to fully-understand the risks to human health in space and to fully-understand how humans, plants, animals and microbes can safely and effectively travel and eventually live for long periods beyond the protective environment of Earth, the biophysical properties underlying these changes must be studied, characterized and understood. This lecture reviews the current state of NASA biophysics research accomplishments and identifies future trends and challenges for biophysics research on the International Space Station and beyond.","[{""submissionId"":20160006438,""id"":""43b302c3f85248e1b9d1a2964bb39c93"",""publicationDate"":""2015-04-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160006438,""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""2c51575915fa4ff7bbd82ba95b283640"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Miami Univ."",""location"":""Oxford, OH, United States""}},""meetingId"":""b7fe71a3606a4251b7c026f101214f02"",""id"":""78eab42f41cc43e0afc0b0cede335d00""}],""name"":""Benson Memorial Lecture"",""location"":""Oxford, OH"",""id"":""b7fe71a3606a4251b7c026f101214f02"",""startDate"":""2015-04-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""WBS 904211.01.01.30.01""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160006438
20190002151,PRESENTATION,Effects of Altered Gravity on the Central Nervous System of Drosophila melanogaster,"[""Mhatre, Siddhita D."",""Iyer, Janani S."",""Paul, Amber M."",""Zavaleta, Jhony A."",""Hosamani, Ravikumar""]","A comprehensive understanding of the effects of spaceflight and altered gravity on human physiology is necessary for continued human space exploration and long-term space habitation. Spaceflight includes multiple factors such as microgravity, hypergravity, ionizing radiation, physiological stress, and disrupted circadian rhythms and these have been shown to contribute to pathophysiological responses that target immunity, bone and muscle integrity, cardiovascular and nervous systems. In terrestrial conditions, some of these factors can lead to cancer and neuroimmunological disorders. In this study, we used a well-established spaceflight model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to assess spaceflight-associated changes in the nervous system. We hypothesize that exposure to altered gravity triggers the oxidative stress response, leading to impairments in the nervous system. To test this hypothesis, we used two experimental paradigms: 1) hypergravity, using the ground-based chronic acceleration model, and 2) spaceflight conditions, which includes exposure to microgravity and in-flight space 1g controls. In our ground studies, acute hypergravity resulted in an induction of oxidative stress-related genes with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fly brains. Additionally, we observed a depressed locomotor phenotype in these flies (p<0.05). These flies also show a decreased dopaminergic neuron counts in the fly brain upon exposure to acute hypergravity (p<0.05). Thus, the data suggest that altered gravity has a profound effect on the fly nervous system. Similarly, we observe behavioral impairments (p<0.001) and synaptic deficits, including decreased synaptic connections (p<0.05), in 3rd instar larvae which were developed in space. Furthermore, space-grown adults show a decrease in neuronal (p<0.05) and dendritic field (p<0.01) in adult brains coupled with an increased number of apoptotic cells (p<0.001), suggesting increased neuronal loss under spaceflight conditions. In summary, we observe that altered gravity leads to gross neurological deficits. To better understand the long-term effects of spaceflight on the nervous system, longitudinal and multigenerational changes were also identified. This study will help elucidate the different approaches to prevent nervous system dysfunction in astronauts during spaceflight, while also contributing to a better understanding of the pathways that are related to some CNS disorders on Earth.","[{""submissionId"":20190002151,""id"":""489443cdff864e87918f90275ca0c18a"",""publicationDate"":""2019-03-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20190002151,""endDate"":""2019-03-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""a14254d8f0b24ef68c85ba77bac2dc73"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Genetics Society of America"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d72d168cff0b487f917216bf769ed9f3"",""id"":""08f64542aad140f3bbcaf5bbbae18702""}],""name"":""Annual Drosophila Research Conference"",""location"":""Dallas, TX"",""id"":""d72d168cff0b487f917216bf769ed9f3"",""startDate"":""2019-03-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C"",""NNA16BD14C"",""NNH15CO48B"",""80NSSC18M0060""]",undefined,"[""Exobiology""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190002151

These physiological changes cause balance, gait and visual disturbances, cardiovascular deconditioning, and loss of muscle mass and strength. These changes may affect a crewmember's ability to perform critical mission tasks immediately after landing on a planetary surface. To understand how changes in physiological function affect functional performance, an interdisciplinary pre- and postflight testing regimen, Functional Task Test (FTT), was developed to systematically evaluate both astronaut functional performance and related physiological changes. Ultimately this information will be used to assess performance risks and inform the design of countermeasures for exploration class missions. We are currently conducting the FTT study on International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers before and after 6-month expeditions. Additionally, in a corresponding study we are using the FTT protocol on subjects before and after 70 days of 6deg head-down bed-rest as an analog for space flight. Bed-rest provides the opportunity for us to investigate the role of prolonged axial body unloading in isolation from the other physiological effects produced by exposure to the microgravity environment of space flight. Therefore, the bed rest analog allows us to investigate the impact of body unloading on both functional tasks and on the underlying physiological factors that lead to decrement in performance and then compare them with the results obtained in our space flight study. Functional tests included ladder climbing, hatch opening, jump down, manual manipulation of objects and tool use, seat egress and obstacle avoidance, recovery from a fall and object translation tasks. Physiological measures included assessments of postural and gait control, dynamic visual acuity, fine motor control, plasma volume, heart rate, blood pressure, orthostatic intolerance, upper- and lower-body muscle strength, power, endurance, control, and neuromuscular drive. ISS crewmembers were tested three times before flight, and on 1, 6, and 30 days after landing. Bed-rest subjects were tested three times before bed-rest and immediately after getting up from bed-rest as well as 1, 6, and 12 days after reambulation.","[{""submissionId"":20140005022,""id"":""6d383ffb17f14f54a16a7472b1676d1f"",""publicationDate"":""2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140005022,""name"":""American Astronautical Society"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States"",""id"":""162428b878f24594a88874d55027f2ca""},{""submissionId"":20140005022,""endDate"":""2014-06-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Astronautical Society"",""location"":""Springfield, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""7b133735b9ae45edb304a755b700beb7"",""id"":""be317c34b388407b87f3f513e903db35""}],""name"":""American Astronautical Society - ISS Research and Development Conference"",""location"":""Chicago, IL"",""id"":""7b133735b9ae45edb304a755b700beb7"",""startDate"":""2014-06-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140005022

L.""]","Locomotion on a treadmill in 0 G will probably remain a centerpiece of NASA's exercise countermeasures programme. This form of physical activity has the potential to cause large bone and muscle forces as well as loading during a period of continuous treadmill exercise. A critical concern is the provision of a treadmill which can approximate 1 G performance in space. At this point, no adequate objective measurements of in-flight treadmill kinetics or of the human response to this activity have been made. Interpretation of the results obtained in the present study is limited by the following: (1) bungee tensions were not measured; (2) ground reaction forces were not measured in parallel with the kinematic measurements; and (3) the instrumentation used to film the astronauts could itself have been affected by microgravity. Despite these shortcomings, what is apparent is that exercise during NASA missions STS 7 and STS 8 resulted in leg motions that were similar to those found during 1 G locomotion on an inclined passive treadmill and on an active treadmill at an even steeper grade. In addition, it was apparent that the majority of the loads were transmitted through the forefoot, and one can surmise that this style of running would result in physiologically significant tensions in the calf musculature and resultant ankle compressive loading. Further speculation regarding limb loading is complicated by the fact that varying amounts of force are transmitted through (1) the treadmill handle and (2) bungee cords that act as a tether. New generations of treadmills are being manufactured that could provide I important information for planners of long-duration space missions. If these types of treadmill are flown on future missions, it will be possible to control bungee tensions more precisely, control for grade and speed, and, most importantly, provide data on the rates and magnitudes of limb loading. These data could then be incorporated into biomechanical models of the lower limb to more fully understand mechanisms of load transmission from distal to proximal structures and to optimize in-flight exercise protocols in such a way that muscle and bone loss could be reduced.","[{""submissionId"":20000039761,""id"":""7476a20059524ca49de2566c28af186e"",""publicationName"":""Three-Dimensional Analysis of Human Locomotion"",""publicationDate"":""1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000039761
19960050288,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Trabecular Bone Mechanical Properties and Fractal Dimension,"[""Hogan, Harry A.""]","Countermeasures for reducing bone loss and muscle atrophy due to extended exposure to the microgravity environment of space are continuing to be developed and improved. An important component of this effort is finite element modeling of the lower extremity and spinal column. These models will permit analysis and evaluation specific to each individual and thereby provide more efficient and effective exercise protocols. Inflight countermeasures and post-flight rehabilitation can then be customized and targeted on a case-by-case basis. Recent Summer Faculty Fellowship participants have focused upon finite element mesh generation, muscle force estimation, and fractal calculations of trabecular bone microstructure. Methods have been developed for generating the three-dimensional geometry of the femur from serial section magnetic resonance images (MRI). The use of MRI as an imaging modality avoids excessive exposure to radiation associated with X-ray based methods. These images can also detect trabecular bone microstructure and architecture. The goal of the current research is to determine the degree to which the fractal dimension of trabecular architecture can be used to predict the mechanical properties of trabecular bone tissue. The elastic modulus and the ultimate strength (or strain) can then be estimated from non-invasive, non-radiating imaging and incorporated into the finite element models to more accurately represent the bone tissue of each individual of interest. Trabecular bone specimens from the proximal tibia are being studied in this first phase of the work. Detailed protocols and procedures have been developed for carrying test specimens through all of the steps of a multi-faceted test program. The test program begins with MRI and X-ray imaging of the whole bones before excising a smaller workpiece from the proximal tibia region. High resolution MRI scans are then made and the piece further cut into slabs (roughly 1 cm thick). The slabs are X-rayed again and also scanned using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Cube specimens are then cut from the slabs and tested mechanically in compression. Correlations between mechanical properties and fractal dimension will then be examined to assess and quantify the predictive capability of the fractal calculations.","[{""volume"":""1"",""submissionId"":19960050288,""id"":""e1702a9fa4d845339e652a6b2b341b49"",""publicationName"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Summer Faculty Fellowship Program: 1995"",""publicationDate"":""1996-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":19960050278,""title"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Summer Faculty Fellowship Program: 1995""},{""id"":19960050278,""title"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Summer Faculty Fellowship Program: 1995""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19960050288

A."",""Lupton, J.""]","Until 2006, it was not been possible to assess nutritional status of crewmembers on the ISS during flight because blood and urine could not be collected during ISS missions. Postflight observations of alterations in status of several nutrients are troubling, and we require the ability to monitor the status of these nutrients during flight to determine if there is a specific impetus or timeframe for these changes. In addition to the monitoring of crew nutritional status during flight, in-flight sample collection would allow better assessment of countermeasure effectiveness. Collecting samples during flight is one of the objectives of SMO 016E, and it is also designed to expand the current medical requirement for nutritional assessment (MR016L) to include additional normative markers for assessing crew health and countermeasure effectiveness. Additional markers of bone metabolism will be measured to better monitor bone health and the effectiveness of countermeasures to prevent bone resorption. New markers of oxidative damage will be measured to better assess the type of oxidative insults that occur during space flight. The array of nutritional assessment variables will be expanded to include ones that will allow us to better understand changes in folate, vitamin K, and vitamin B6 status, as well as risk factors for cardiovascular and oxidative damage during and after flight. Stress hormones and hormones that affect bone and muscle metabolism will also be measured. Measuring these additional variables will allow us to better monitor the health of crewmembers and make more accurate recommendations for their rehabilitation. Several nutritional assessment variables are altered at landing, but it is not known how long these changes persist. We extended the original protocol to include an additional postflight blood and urine sample collection 30 days after landing. Data are being collected before, during, and after flight. These data will provide a complete survey of how nutritional status and related systems are affected by space flight. Analyzing the data will help us to define nutritional requirements for long-duration missions. This expanded set of measurements will also aid in the identification of nutritional countermeasures to counteract, for example, the deleterious effects of microgravity on bone and muscle and the effects of space radiation.","[{""submissionId"":20080048284,""id"":""536c618aa70b46aab98028ac13504ab4"",""publicationDate"":""2009-02-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20080048284,""endDate"":""2010-02-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""NASA Human Research Program"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""b8f3a2689d7742d6978c8fc45982dc8a"",""startDate"":""2010-02-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20080048284,""endDate"":""2009-02-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""League City, TX"",""id"":""f64912ba09114b4dbba7a8b3fe542fcb"",""startDate"":""2009-02-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080048284

These physiological changes include sensorimotor disturbances, cardiovascular deconditioning and loss of muscle mass and strength. These changes might affect the ability of crewmembers to perform critical mission tasks immediately after landing on lunar and Martian surfaces. To date, changes in functional performance have not been systematically studied or correlated with physiological changes. To understand how changes in physiological function impact functional performance an interdisciplinary pre/postflight testing regimen (Functional Task Test, FTT) has been developed that systematically evaluates both astronaut postflight functional performance and related physiological changes. The overall objectives of the FTT are to: Develop a set of functional tasks that represent critical mission tasks for Constellation. Determine the ability to perform these tasks after flight. Identify the key physiological factors that contribute to functional decrements. Use this information to develop targeted countermeasures. The functional test battery was designed to address high priority tasks identified by the Constellation program as critical for mission success. The set of functional tests making up the FTT include the: 1) Seat Egress and Walk Test, 2) Ladder Climb Test, 3) Recovery from Fall/Stand Test, 4) Rock Translation Test, 5) Jump Down Test, 6) Torque Generation Test, and 7) Construction Activity Board Test. Corresponding physiological measures include assessments of postural and gait control, dynamic visual acuity, fine motor control, plasma volume, orthostatic intolerance, upper and lower body muscle strength, power, fatigue, control and neuromuscular drive. Crewmembers will perform both functional and physiological tests before and after short (Shuttle) and long-duration (ISS) space flight. Data will be collected on R+0 (Shuttle only), R+1, R+6 and R+30. Using a multivariate regression model we will identify which physiological systems contribute the most to impaired performance on each functional test. This will allow us to identify the physiological systems that play the largest role in decrement in functional performance. Using this information we can then design and implement countermeasures that specifically target the physiological systems most responsible for the altered functional performance associated with space flight.","[{""submissionId"":20090004156,""id"":""9fd700e7aaba4e96a88dd89749027b8b"",""publicationDate"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20090004156,""endDate"":""2009-02-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop"",""location"":""League City, TX"",""id"":""625bd43cb2c94537a9ae67c8940813c3"",""startDate"":""2009-02-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090004156
20010122940,PREPRINT,Effects of Spaceflight and Hindlimb Suspension on the Posture and Gait of Rats,"[""Fox, R. A."",""Corcoran, M."",""Daunton, N. G."",""Morey-Holton, E.""]","Instability of posture and gait in astronauts following spaceflight (SF) is thought to result from muscle atrophy and from changes in sensory-motor integration in the CNS (central nervous system) that occur during adaptation to microgravity (micro-G). Individuals are thought to have developed, during SF, adaptive changes for the processing of proprioceptive, vestibular and visual sensory inputs with reduced weighting of gravity-based signals and increased weighting of visual and tactile cues. This sensory-motor rearrangement in the CNS apparently occurs to optimize neuromuscular system function for effective movement and postural control in micro-G. However, these adaptive changes are inappropriate for the 1 g environment and lead to disruptions in posture and gait on return to Earth. Few reports are available on the effects of SF on the motor behavior of animals. Rats studied following 18.5 - 19.5 days of SF in the COSMOS program were described as being ..'inert, apathetic, slow'.. and generally unstable. The hindlimbs of these rats were ..'thrust out from the body with fingers pulled apart and the shin unnaturally pronated'. On the 6th postflight day motor behavior was described as similar to that observed in preflight observations. Improved understanding of the mechanisms leading to these changes can be obtained in animal models through detailed analysis of neural and molecular mechanisms related to gait. To begin this process the posture and gait of rats were examined following exposure to either SF or hindlimb suspension (HLS), and during recovery from these conditions.","[{""submissionId"":20010122940,""id"":""10849384de6e442695285abc1626e256"",""publicationDate"":""1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Unknown"",""submissionId"":20010122940,""name"":""12th International Symposium on Posture and Gait"",""id"":""c928ae1d04d6485093a591bd0e06db77""}]",PUBLIC,"[""RTOP 199-16-12-01""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20010122940

Beneath the allure of weightlessness and cosmic views, however, lies a set of serious health risks for space travelers, including muscle and bone issues, heart problems, and cognitive impairment. In this mini review, we delve into the topic of metabolic suppression, an innovative approach to mitigating the deleterious effects of space travel that has been proposed for astronauts that may be appropriate for space tourists as well. Drawing inspiration from the survival strategies observed in hibernating animals and often depicted in sci-fi narratives where crews are in “suspended animation” throughout most of the voyage, this method involves inducing a reversible state of dormancy, akin to torpor, in human space travelers. The objective of metabolic suppression is to safeguard space travelers from the adverse impacts of extended exposure to microgravity and space radiation on long duration expeditions, so that on arrival at their destination, they can be healthy and ready to go.  We shed light on ongoing research endeavors led by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and other prominent organizations dedicated to investing in and advancing metabolic suppression technologies for professional space travel, that may also enable space tourism to ever more distant destinations","[{""volume"":""12"",""submissionId"":20230018387,""issue"":""6"",""issn"":""2167-0269"",""publisher"":""MDPI"",""id"":""aa1b1697203744f7a81175aae3d83785"",""publicationName"":""Journal of Tourism and Hospitality"",""publicationDate"":""2024-01-18T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""issuePublicationDate"":""2024-01-18T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""url"":"""",""doi"":""10.35248/2167-0269.24.12.537""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""919125.01.04.02.01""]",undefined,"[""Lunar and Planetary Science and Exploration"",""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230018387

The design team divided the functions of the device into three major groups: methods of supplying force, methods of adjusting force, and methods of transmitting the force to the user. After analyzing the three main functions of the RED and developing alternatives for each, the design team used a comparative decision process to choose the most feasible components for the overall design. The design team selected the constant force spring alternative for further embodiment. The device consists of an array of different sized constant force springs which can be pinned in different combinations to produce the required output forces. The force is transmitted by means of a shaft and gear system. The final report is divided into four sections. An introduction section discusses the sponsor background, problem background and requirements of the device. The second section covers the alternative designs for each of the main functions.

Dehydrated cysts were activated, on orbit, by addition of salt water to the cysts, and then development was terminated by the addition of fixative. Development took place in 5 ml syringes, connected by tubing to activation syringes, containing salt water, and termination syringes, containing fixative. Comparison of space results with simultaneous ground control experiments showed that equivalent percentages of naupliar larvae hatched in the syringes (40%). Thus, reactivation of development, completion of embryogenesis, emergence and hatching took place, during spaceflight, without recognizable alteration in numbers of larvae produced. Post-hatching larval development was studied in experiments where development was terminated, by introduction of fixative, 2 days, 4 days, and 8 days after reinitiation of development. During spaceflight, successive larval instars or stages, interrupted by molts, occurred, generating brine shrimp at appropriate larval instars. Naupliar larvae possessed the single naupliar eye, and development of the lateral pair of adult eyes also took place in space. Transmission electron microscopy revealed extensive differentiation, including skeletal muscle and gut endoderm, as well as the eye tissues. These studies demonstrate the potential value of Artemia for developmental biology studies during spa ceflight, and show that extensive degrees of development can take place in this microgravity environment.","[{""volume"":""14"",""submissionId"":19950029060,""issue"":""8"",""issn"":""0273-1177"",""isbn"":""0-08-042485-6"",""id"":""e9f0a9b05db14dd1bdae05a077e11bb3"",""publicationName"":""Life sciences and space research 25 (1).

20140002357,OTHER,On-Command Force and Torque Impeding Devices (OC-FTID) Using ERF,"[""Bar-Cohen, Yoseph"",""Badescu, Mircea"",""Sherrit, Stewart""]","Various machines have been developed to address the need for countermeasures of bone and muscle deterioration when humans operate over extended time in space. Even though these machines are in use, each of them has many limitations that need to be addressed in an effort to prepare for human missions to distant bodies in the solar system. An exercise exoskeleton was conceived that performs on-demand resistivity by inducing force and torque impedance via ElectroRheological Fluid (ERF). The resistive elements consist of pistons that are moving inside ERF-filled cylinders or a donut-shaped cavity, and the fluid flows through the piston when the piston is moved. Tests of the operation of ERF against load showed the feasibility of this approach. ERF properties of high yield stress, low current density, and fast response (less than one millisecond) offer essential characteristics for the construction of the exoskeleton. ERFs can apply very high electrically controlled resistive forces or torque while their size (weight and geometric parameters) can be very small. Their long life and ability to function in a wide temperature range (from -40 to 200 C) allows for their use in extreme environments. ERFs are also nonabrasive, non-toxic, and nonpolluting (meet health and safety regulations). The technology is applicable as a compact exercise machine for astronauts' countermeasure of microgravity, an exercise machine for sport, or as a device for rehabilitation of patients with limb issues.","[{""submissionId"":20140002357,""id"":""c1089f57de624a5dbddd52aaa6565c42"",""publicationName"":""NASA Tech Briefs, January 2014"",""publicationDate"":""2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]","[{""id"":20140001109,""title"":""NASA Tech Briefs, January 2014""},{""id"":20140001109,""title"":""NASA Tech Briefs, January 2014""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140002357

However, data has shown that existing exercise countermeasures are not as effective as desired for preventing bone loss in long duration, 4 to 6 months, spaceflight [1,3,5,6]. This spaceflight related bone loss may cause early onset of osteoporosis to place the astronauts at greater risk of fracture later in their lives. Consequently, NASA seeks to have improved understanding of the mechanisms of bone demineralization in microgravity in order to appropriately quantify this risk, and to establish appropriate countermeasures [7]. In this light, NASA's Digital Astronaut Project (DAP) is working with the NASA Bone Discipline Lead to implement well-validated computational models to help predict and assess bone loss during spaceflight, and enhance exercise countermeasure development. More specifically, computational modeling is proposed as a way to augment bone research and exercise countermeasure development to target weight-bearing skeletal sites that are most susceptible to bone loss in microgravity, and thus at higher risk for fracture. Given that hip fractures can be debilitating, the initial model development focused on the femoral neck. Future efforts will focus on including other key load bearing bone sites such as the greater trochanter, lower lumbar, proximal femur and calcaneus. The DAP has currently established an initial model (Beta Version) of bone loss due to skeletal unloading in femoral neck region. The model calculates changes in mineralized volume fraction of bone in this segment and relates it to changes in bone mineral density (vBMD) measured by Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT). The model is governed by equations describing changes in bone volume fraction (BVF), and rates of changes in bone cell populations that remove and replace bone in packets within the bone region. The DAP bone model is unique in several respects. In particular in takes former models of volume fraction changes one step higher in fidelity and separates BVF into separate equations for mineralized and osteoid volume fractions governed by a mineralization rate. This more closely follows the physiology of the remodeling unit cycles where bone is first resorbed and then followed by the action of osteoblasts to lay down collagen matrix which eventually becomes mineralized. In another respect, the modules allow the functional description of the time rate of change of other parameters and variables in the model during a computational simulation. More detailed description of the model, preliminary validation results, current limitation and caveats, and planned advancements are provided in sections 2 through 5. The DAP bone model is being developed primarily as a research tool, and not as a clinical tool like QCT. Even if it transitions to a clinical tool, it is not intended to replace QCT or any other clinical tool. Moreover, the DAP bone model does not predict bone fracture. Its purpose is to provide valuable additional data via ""forward prediction"" simulations for during and after spaceflight missions to gain insight on, (1) mechanisms of bone demineralization in microgravity, and (2) the volumetric changes at the various bone sites in response to in-flight and post-flight exercise countermeasures. This data can then be used as input to the Keyak [8] (or equivalent) FE analysis method to gain insight on how bone strength may change during and after flight. This information can also be useful to help optimize exercise countermeasure protocols to minimize changes in bone strength during flight, and improve regain of bone strength post-flight. To achieve this goal, the bone model will be integrated with DAP's exercise countermeasure models to simulate the effect of exercise prescriptions on preserving bone. More specifically, the model will accept loading history due to muscle and joint force on bone and produce quantified remodeling within the bone region under influence of the applied stress. Furthermore, because they tend to respond differently, the bone remodeling model includes both trabecular bone and cortical bone.","[{""submissionId"":20140003236,""id"":""3a8a047a0c814feeac0caae5ff4479d7"",""publicationDate"":""2013-09-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140003236,""endDate"":""2013-11-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""8ccaff322ecb48d2811364bf91d9f59d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""91f6e89baa2a48caad25dcfc6c8244eb"",""id"":""f1d60adba7b84e618ed2529f484c1366""}],""name"":""Bone Summit II Research and Clinical Advisory Panel Meeting"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""91f6e89baa2a48caad25dcfc6c8244eb"",""startDate"":""2013-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140003236
20230000609,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Modeling and Simulation for Exercise Vibration Isolation and Stabilization System Design,"[""Leslie Quiocho"",""Kaitlin Lostroscio"",""Sanjay Joshi"",""Erik Kovel"",""Keith Vetter"",""David Frenkel"",""Charlotte Bell"",""Lauren Nilsson"",""Angela Reeves"",""John R MacLean""]","The microgravity environment that crew members experience on orbit presents a well-known health challenge, particularly when it comes to loss of muscle and bone mass. To counteract these negative effects, exercise countermeasures play a critical role in the daily routine of the crew on the International Space Station (ISS). To help inform requirements for upcoming exploration missions such as the Gateway Program, a new device, called the European Enhanced Exploration Exercise Device (E4D), is being built by the European Space Agency through their contractor, the Danish Aerospace Company. The E4D is being demonstrated on the ISS and is unique from other current exercise devices in that it provides four separate modalities in a single device: resistive, cycle ergometry, seated aerobic rowing, and rope pulling. To support the integration of E4D on ISS, a passive Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (VIS) system was required by NASA, and this responsibility was given to the Johnson Space Center.

This paper describes the end-to-end process of modeling, simulation, and analysis used to inform the mechanical design of the VIS system. The process begins with the collection of representative exerciser motion capture (MoCap) through ground-based testing with the developmental E4D in both the Prototype Immersive Technology (PIT) Laboratory and the Active Response Gravity Offload System (ARGOS) facility at the Johnson Space Center. These collected MoCap data are processed through human biomechanics modeling to create forcing functions as input to a multibody dynamics simulation of the combined E4D/VIS system, with numerous resulting outputs. These outputs include microgravity accelerations, overall system displacements, internal and transmitted loads, as well as collisions. Microgravity accelerations are compared for compliance against ISS requirements while  displacements are used for sway space determinations on the design and volumetric constraints within the targeted module. Internal loads are supplied to the supporting stress analysis teams and external loads for structural loads and dynamics teams, both at NASA and ESA. Finally, contact and clearance analysis is performed using the simulation to eliminate potential design issues. To ensure that the elements of the multibody simulation were verified and validated, correlation against multiple VIS related ground hardware testbeds was performed and characterized.

In addition to the isolation part of the VIS problem, stabilization is also key to the integrated performance and evaluation. Due to the difficulty in defining ISS requirements in this area, the stability of the exerciser was inspected via analysis. Loss of balance was defined analytically as occurring when the resultant force vector acting on the exerciser lies outside the base of support of the feet.

Both the VIS and E4D teams have recently gone through their Critical Design Reviews (CDRs) and the iterative model-based approach has been integral to inform mechanical design, particularly in the case of the VIS. This same end-to-end approach is now being applied for the Gateway Program, where an Exploration Exercise Device (EED) derived from the E4D and notional VIS for the device are under concept development.","[{""volume"":"""",""submissionId"":20230000609,""issn"":""1095-323X"",""isbn"":""9781665490337"",""publisher"":""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"",""id"":""9d7ba464d10f4685bfb538d249295427"",""eisbn"":""9781665490320"",""publicationName"":""2023 IEEE Aerospace Conference"",""publicationDate"":""2023-05-15T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""doi"":""10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115861""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230000609,""endDate"":""2023-03-11T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""c89d4cba478b520a8c47b5bcac2f6911"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"",""location"":""Piscataway, New Jersey, United States""}},""meetingId"":""3d46037df0fc4ea9ad8aab42f038866e"",""id"":""a2e06455f1c4438394fc2c993fab5732""}],""name"":""IEEE Aerospace Conference"",""location"":""Big Sky, MT"",""id"":""3d46037df0fc4ea9ad8aab42f038866e"",""url"":""aeroconf.org"",""startDate"":""2023-03-04T06:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""251546.06.15.05.01.72.03"",""80JSC020D0060"",""80JSC023DA010""]",undefined,"[""Numerical Analysis""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230000609

M.""]","Results from previous studies have shown that the reduction in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) with simulated microgravity is attenuated in chemically sympathectomized rats. To determine the contributions of the catecholamines from the adrenal medulla in this process, investigations were conducted with 65 saline injected (SAL) and chemically sympathectomized (SX) female rats that were either surgically demedullated (DM), or intact (IN). Microgravity conditions were simulated by head-down suspension (HDS) while controls were assigned to individual cages (CC). The experimental period was 14 d. The rats were tested for VO2max, treadmill run time (RT), and submaximal mechanical efficiency (ME) prior to suspension and on days 7 and 14. Saline injected rats that had intact adrenal medullas (SAL-IN) exhibited significantly reduced measures of VO2max after 7 and 14 d by 15% and 21%, respectively. No significant reduction in VO2max was observed with HDS in the SX-IN animals. Sympathectomized rats that were demedullated (SX-DM) also exhibited a significant reduction in VO2max (12%). In addition, HDS was associated with a marked and significant reduction in RT in all groups. ME for submaximal exercise was significantly reduced after HDS in SAL-IN rats but not in the SX-IN rats. SX-DM rats experienced significant reductions in ME similar in magnitude to the SAL-IN rats. These results confirm that chemical sympathectomy attenuates the expected decrease in VO2max with HDS and suggests that circulating epinephrine contributes to this response.","[{""volume"":""63"",""submissionId"":20050000755,""issue"":""3"",""issn"":""0095-6562"",""id"":""7a735da002dc4558b4ac733fdf9328fe"",""publicationName"":""Aviation, space, and environmental medicine"",""publicationDate"":""1992-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050000755

As we move nearer to assembly complete, replanning activities by NASA and ISS International Partners have been completed and the final complement of research facilities on ISS is becoming more certain. This paper will review pans for facilities in the US On-orbit Segment of ISS, including contributions from International Partners, to provide a vision of the research capabilities that will be available starting in 2010. At present, in addition to research capabilities in the Russian segment, the United States Destiny research module houses nine research facilities or racks. These facilities include five multi-purpose EXPRESS racks, two Human Research Facility (HRF) racks, the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG), and the Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI), enabling a wide range of exploration-related applied as well as basic research. In the coming years, additional racks will be launched to augment this robust capability: Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR), Fluids Integrated Rack (FIR), Window Observation Rack Facility (WORF), Microgravity Science Research Rack (MSRR), Muscle Atrophy Research Exercise System (MARES), additional EXPRESS racks and possibly a second MELFI. In addition, EXPRESS Logistics Carriers (ELC) will provide attach points for external payloads. The European Space Agency s Columbus module will contain five research racks and provide four external attach sites. The research racks are Biolab, European Physiology Module (EPM), Fluid Science Lab (FSL), European Drawer System (EDS) and European Transport Carrier (ETC). The Japanese Kibo elements will initially support three research racks, Ryutai for fluid science, Saibo for cell science, and Kobairo for materials research, as well as 10 attachment sites for external payloads. As we look ahead to assembly complete, these new facilities represent a threefold increase from the current research laboratory infrastructure on ISS. In addition, the increase in resident crew size will increase from three to six in 2009, will provide the long-term capacity for completing research on board ISS. Transportation to and from ISS for crew and cargo will be provided by a fleet of vehicles from the United States, Russia, ESA and Japan, including accommodations for thermally-conditioned cargo. The completed ISS will have robust research accommodations to support the multidisciplinary research objective of scientists worldwide.","[{""submissionId"":20070011621,""id"":""5984d9f688db4cbebeff97d8250cbad0"",""publicationDate"":""2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20070011621,""name"":""International Astronautical Federation"",""location"":""Paris, France"",""id"":""7d2c9639b447427abc7e630517af671e""},{""country"":""India"",""submissionId"":20070011621,""endDate"":""2007-09-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Astronautical Federation"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""7b75f0af4e2b4151a01fc6c8f13b50a6"",""id"":""901ff446771f4ae9b1b3220ff2804412""}],""name"":""58th International Astronautical Congress"",""location"":""Hyderabad"",""id"":""7b75f0af4e2b4151a01fc6c8f13b50a6"",""startDate"":""2007-09-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Space Processing""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070011621

As humans explore and develop space, however, we must learn to adapt to an environment with little or no gravity. Studies indicate that lack of weightbearing for vertebrates occurring with immobilization, paralysis, or in a microgravity environment may cause muscle and bone atrophy through cellular and subcellular level mechanisms. We hypothesize that gravity is needed for the efficient transduction of cell growth and survival signals from the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) (consisting of molecules such as collagen, fibronectin, and laminin) in mechanosensitive tissues. We test for the presence of gravity-sensitive pathways in bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) using hypergravity applied by a cell culture centrifuge. Stimulation of 50 times gravity (50-g) increased proliferation in primary rat osteoblasts for cells grown on collagen Type I and fibronectin, but not on laminin or uncoated surfaces. Survival was also enhanced during hypergravity stimulation by the presence of ECM. Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in proliferating cells showed an increase in the number of actively dividing cells from about 60% at 1-g to over 90% at 25-g. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to test for all possible integrins. Our combined results indicate that beta1 and/or beta3 integrin subunits may be involved. These data indicate that gravity mechanostimulation of osteoblast proliferation involves specific matrix-integrin signalling pathways which are sensitive to g-level. Further research to define the mechanisms involved will provide direction so that we may better adapt and counteract bone atrophy caused by the lack of weightbearing.","[{""submissionId"":20040081243,""id"":""67c53af7b7554678bdb8996aaa273775"",""publicationDate"":""2004-03-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Unknown"",""submissionId"":20040081243,""endDate"":""2004-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""Astrobiology Conference"",""id"":""8d83e9cff74e4ee0a1f7b19b35f982ca"",""startDate"":""2004-03-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NASA-00-OBPR-01-066""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040081243

The Neuroscience Laboratory at JSC is developing a method based on stochastic resonance to enhance the brain s ability to detect signals from the balance organs of the inner ear and use them for rapid improvement in balance skill, especially when combined with balance training exercises. This method involves a stimulus delivery system that is wearable/portable providing imperceptible electrical stimulation to the balance organs of the human body. Stochastic resonance (SR) is a phenomenon whereby the response of a nonlinear system to a weak periodic input signal is optimized by the presence of a particular non-zero level of noise. This phenomenon of SR is based on the concept of maximizing the flow of information through a system by a non-zero level of noise. Application of imperceptible SR noise coupled with sensory input in humans has been shown to improve motor, cardiovascular, visual, hearing, and balance functions. SR increases contrast sensitivity and luminance detection; lowers the absolute threshold for tone detection in normal hearing individuals; improves homeostatic function in the human blood pressure regulatory system; improves noise-enhanced muscle spindle function; and improves detection of weak tactile stimuli using mechanical or electrical stimulation. SR noise has been shown to improve postural control when applied as mechanical noise to the soles of the feet, or when applied as electrical noise at the knee and to the back muscles.","[{""submissionId"":20120014149,""id"":""8c851d2f22dc4f288c06c1d4619ca3c9"",""publicationName"":""NASA Tech Briefs, September 2012"",""publicationDate"":""2012-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]","[{""id"":20120014089,""title"":""NASA Tech Briefs, September 2012""},{""id"":20120014089,""title"":""NASA Tech Briefs, September 2012""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120014149

Beyond this, food provides psychosocial benefits throughout a mission. Objective: The purpose of this presentation is to discuss dietary intake data from multiple space programs, including Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. Description: These data arise from medical monitoring of both dietary intake and crew health, as well as research protocols designed to assess the role of diet in counteracting bone loss and other health concerns. Ground-based studies are conducted to better understand some of the negative issues related to space flight. Examples of these analog studies are extended bed rest studies, vitamin D supplementation studies in Antarctica, and saturation diving missions on the floor of the ocean. Methods and findings will be presented describing the use of weighed records, diet diaries, and food frequency questionnaires in these various environments. Provision of food and nutrients in spaceflight is important for many body systems including cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, endocrine, immune, and others. Some key areas of concern are loss of body mass, bone and muscle loss, radiation exposure, nutrient intakes during spacewalks, depletion of nutrient stores, and inadequate dietary intake. Initial experimental research studies using food and nutrition as a countermeasure to aid in mitigating these concerns are underway. Conclusion: Beyond their importance for the few individuals leaving the planet, these studies have significant implications for those remaining on Earth.","[{""submissionId"":20110016714,""id"":""ec991322d41441d79a2e8e0febd0ae06"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110016714,""endDate"":""2012-03-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""36th National Nutrient Databank Conference"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""effc98a62a684a84bdbcc06cf3a47d84"",""startDate"":""2012-03-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110016714

Animals in the experimental cohort consisted of mice that spent 37 days on the ISS within the Rodent Habitat. Ground control animals consisted of mice of identical age, sex, strain, in a terrestrial Rodent Habitat controlled for temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide levels, to match ISS conditions as closely as possible. RNA extracted from eye, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney tissue specimens was subjected to next-generation sequencing to acquire primary data.

Our analysis employed cutting-edge software developed at NASA Ames Research Center, executed on the NASA Ames Supercomputer and on another high-performance computer, for accurate variant calling of single point mutations.  ISS-flown mice exhibited a notably heightened level of somatic mutation compared to control mice.  The degree of somatic mutation correlated  with the degree of gene expression across the four tissue types, i.e., the greatest rate of mutation accumulation was seen in highly expressed genes.

We discovered that guanine substitutions were the most common type of somatic mutation. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that DNA mutation events stem from reactive oxygen/nitrogen/chlorine species-mediated guanine oxidation induced by the spaceflight environment.  Since guanine oxidation is a prominent feature of the DNA mutation landscape that accompanies malignant transformation, our findings suggest a possible link between the spaceflight environment and cancer risk that is independent of radiation carcinogenesis.

20090002502,OTHER,LED Device Illuminates New Path to Healing,undefined,"Among NASA s research goals is increased understanding of factors affecting plant growth, including the effects of microgravity. Impeding such studies, traditional light sources used to grow plants on Earth are difficult to adapt to space flight, as they require considerable amounts of power and produce relatively large amounts of heat. As such, an optimized experimental system requires much less energy and reduces temperature variance without negatively affecting plant growth results. Ronald W. Ignatius, founder and chairman of the board at Quantum Devices Inc. (QDI), of Barneveld, Wisconsin, proposed using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the photon source for plant growth experiments in space. This proposition was made at a meeting held by the Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics, a NASA-sponsored research center that facilitates the commercialization of robotics, automation, and other advanced technologies. The Wisconsin group teamed with QDI to determine whether an LED system could provide the necessary wavelengths and intensities for photosynthesis, and the resultant system proved successful. The center then produced the Astroculture3, a plant growth chamber that successfully incorporated this LED light source, which has now flown on several space shuttle missions. NASA subsequently identified another need that could be addressed with the use of LEDs: astronaut health. A central concern in astronaut health is maintaining healthy growth of cells, including preventing bone and muscle loss and boosting the body s ability to heal wounds all adversely affected by prolonged weightlessness. Thus, having determined that LEDs can be used to grow plants in space, NASA decided to investigate whether LEDs might be used for photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT).","[{""submissionId"":20090002502,""id"":""f4dc7d5e193042e0aad6e88372efa4b6"",""publicationName"":""Spinoff 2008: 50 Years of NASA-Derived Technologies (1958-2008)"",""publicationDate"":""2008-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support""]","[{""id"":20090002466,""title"":""Spinoff 2008: 50 Years of NASA-Derived Technologies (1958-2008)""},{""id"":20090002466,""title"":""Spinoff 2008: 50 Years of NASA-Derived Technologies (1958-2008)""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090002502

Bion-M2 is the second biosatellite in the Bion-M series and its goal is to investigate how the space environment affects living organisms, with emphasis on physiological changes in rodents, gravitational biology using a wide variety of specimens, and radiation biology. The Bion-M2 biosatellite will complete a 30-day low earth orbit (LEO) flight to study the combined effects of microgravity and ionizing radiation (IR) on multiple organisms, where the payload may be exposed to IR at 20-30 times thedose rate seen on the International Space Station. Following return, nine U.S. collaborators selected through the NASA Space Biology Research Announcement will conduct post-flight rodent experiments using male C57BL/6 mice. The post-flight experiments will investigate the effects of the space environment on bone and skeletal muscle health, cardiac function, reproductive system function, neurovascular systems, protein composition in plasma, and thermoregulation in the mice. Currently, the Bion-M2 mission is in the development phase of theproject lifecycle. The mission objectives, constraints, requirements, and timeline have been defined in the project plan and contracts. Technology for the mission is under development and science procedures will be finalized by FY22. The aim of this presentation is to highlight the importance of the Bion-M2 mission and provide insight into the mission development process, including an overview of the project plan and the tissue sharing plan that will be utilized during the post-flight dissection procedures.

A. C.""]","Reduced weight-bearing caused by immobilization, bed-rest or microgravity leads to atrophy in mechanosensitive tissue such as muscle and bone. We hypothesize that bone tissue requires earth s gravity (1-g) for the maintenance of extracellular matrix, integrin, and kinase-mediated cell growth and survival pathways. We investigate the role of matrix-integrin signaling in bone cells using cell culture centrifugation to provide different levels of hypergravity mechanostimulation. The 10-50-g range we use also mimics physiological intermedullary pressure (1.2 - 5 kPa). 24 hours at 50-g increased primary rat osteoblast proliferation on collagen Type I and fibronectin, but not laminin or uncoated plastic. BrdU incorporation in primary osteoblasts over 24 h showed hypergravity increased the number of cells actively synthesizing DNA from about 60% at 1-g to over 90% at 25-g. Primary rat fibroblasts grown at 50-g (24 h) showed no proliferation increase, suggesting this is a tissue-specific phenomenon. These results suggest that the betal and alpha4 integrins may be involved. To further test this, we used osteocytic-like MLO-Y4 cells that showed increased proliferation at 1-g with stable expression of a betal integrin cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain construct. At 50-g, MLO-Y4/betal cells showed greater MAPK activation than MLO-Y4 vector controls, suggesting that betal integrin is involved in transducing mitogenic signals in response to hypergravity. Preliminary results also show that interfering with the alpha4 integrin in primary osteoblasts grown on fibronectin blocked the proliferation response. These results indicate that cells from mechanosensitive bone tissue can respond to gravity-generated forces, and this response involves specific matrix and integrin-dependent signaling pathways.","[{""submissionId"":20030107647,""id"":""266669f80b3848d0a103be494f68c7ba"",""publicationDate"":""2003-12-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20030107647,""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States"",""id"":""a6b46c760c86430e982d44ded2793200""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20030107647,""endDate"":""2003-12-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology"",""location"":""Bethesda, MD, United States""}},""meetingId"":""45dda09d47a14bd58e9e8bb92d985d01"",""id"":""99b7859678fb42fab6ce752ef7ab097f""}],""name"":""American Society for Cell Biology Conference"",""location"":""San Francisco, CA"",""id"":""45dda09d47a14bd58e9e8bb92d985d01"",""startDate"":""2003-12-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20030107647

It not only impacts the injury biomechanics of soft tissue but also the physiological responses of the cardiovascular system both due to fluid redistribution and the effect of tissue-related transmural pressure on the large venous blood vessels. Understanding the effects of tissue weight relief is especially important because of the role it may play in understanding the cause of Space Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS). SANS can be characterized by a number of ocular changes which reduce visual acuity and SANS related symptoms occur in up to 51% of astronauts. A prevailing theory for the causation of SANS is that of headward (cephalad) fluid shift and a prolonged increase of Intracranial Pressure (ICP) similar to intracranial hypertension, which is not fully supported by the experimental data or astronaut symptom reporting. However, it is still believed that SANS is caused by a pressure change in the eye and the surrounding tissues. It has been proposed that TWR plays a substantial role in affecting internal pressures and fluid shifts in microgravity.

In this effort, two whole-body Finite Element (FE) models – Elemance and THUMS – are used to ascertain the microgravity-associated TWR of the musculature surrounding the lower body veins. Elemance and THUMS are physics-based computational models that have been validated and verified for several automotive and domestic applications, and as such, can simulate the relief of soft tissue weight due to changes in the gravitation vector. Specifically, the current effort modeled the transition of the gravitational vector from 1G to 0G, applied across the whole-body model in a supine position. For each 1G to 0G transition simulation, the lower body vein’s transmural pressure-time profile was extracted and averaged around the anterior portion of the thigh muscle. The ascertained transmural pressure changes from 1G to 0G transition are given in Figure 1 for the Elemance and the THUMS FE models. The transmural pressure changes of 10 mmHg and 21 mmHg are in the same order of magnitude as Lu’s value of 44 mmHg. It is to be noted that Lu implemented a 0D to 1D lumped parameter model and the Elemance and THUMS are 3D higher order computational models. This proof-of-concept approach demonstrates that TWR pressure can be adequately estimated with in silico techniques however, further in silico investigations need to be conducted to address the unique contributions to the transmural pressure from each of the computational models.",[],"[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230001279,""endDate"":""2023-02-09T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""location"":""Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States""}},""meetingId"":""6009c335aba946598875f4a79a6af84b"",""id"":""4d8ffb60a184476a9132514c4df85e7d""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop (HRP IWS)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""6009c335aba946598875f4a79a6af84b"",""url"":""https://web.cvent.com/event/08d8f955-514e-4e10-b860-bd009811ec13/summary"",""startDate"":""2023-02-07T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""836954.02.02.01""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Mathematical And Computer Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230001279
20240008206,ABSTRACT,Exploration Exercise System (EES) Physiology,"[""Kent Lawrence Kalogera"",""Scott Jonathan Wood""]","Exploration class missions will be required to have an exercise device that is lightweight, has a small footprint, and is capable of providing enough physical stimulus and exercise variability to be an effective countermeasure against muscle, bone, aerobic fitness, and sensorimotor loss that results from the microgravity environment. Ground studies, inflight studies, and results analyses are required to inform Moon2Mars Design Reference Missions (DRMs) and vehicle designs.

This activity encompasses two related projects, an evaluation study called Zero T2 and a requirements development for an exploration treadmill (ET). Exploration class missions’ mass/power/volume restrictions have resulted in the development of exercise devices that are motorized and flywheel-based to provide both aerobic and resistive training on one platform. These devices provide a variety of full body resistance exercise options as well as rowing and cycling for aerobic exercise, but do not provide ambulatory exercise via a treadmill. Because a treadmill has been available for use on the ISS since 2001, we do not understand the efficacy of exploration exercise modalities on muscle performance, aerobic fitness, bone health, or sensorimotor performance. A retrospective study was performed to quantify the association between total exercise (including specific contributions of treadmill exercise) and functional performance upon landing. Due to the relatively small variation in treadmill usage inflight, there is a need to do a controlled study where inflight crewmembers will not use the ISS treadmill (called T2) for the duration of their flights. There will be 3 arms to the Zero T2 study: 1) participants use all currently available exercise platforms aboard ISS (control group), 2) participants use only ARED and CEVIS, and 3) participants use only European Enhanced Exploration Device (E4D). (Please see the TechPort Entry for Exploration Exercise System Development for further detail on the E4D.) This study started in Oct 2020 and will continue through Sep 2027.

In a parallel effort, a team will be developing requirements for an exploration treadmill. This project will be broken into two phases. Phase 1 will develop and implement energy prediction models based on available in-flight exercise data to quantify energy expenditure during 0g treadmill running. Phase 2 will then use the available biomechanical and metabolic evidence from Phase 1 to determine the hardware specification requirements essential to providing the desired exercise stimulus. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) will then leverage the Standardized Process for Evaluating Exercise Devices (SPEED) developed by the team to 1) assess available technologies for candidate treadmills which meet defined requirements, 2) perform hands-on evaluations of top candidates, 3) provide evaluation outcomes and recommendations to developers.

20000029495,OTHER,Sustained Partial Sleep Deprivation: Effects on Immune Modulation and Growth Factors,"[""Mullington, Janet M.""]","The vulnerability to medical emergencies is greatest in space where there are real limits to the availability or effectiveness of ground based assistance. Moreover, astronaut safety and health maintenance will be of increasing importance as we venture out into space for extended periods of time. It is therefore critical to understand the mechanisms of the regulatory physiology of homeostatic systems (sleep, circadian, neuroendocrine, fluid and nutritional balance) and the key roles played in adaptation. This synergy project has combined aims of the ""Human Performance Factors, Sleep and Chronobiology Team""; the ""Immunology, Infection and Hematology Team""; and the ""Muscle Alterations and Atrophy Team"", to broadly address the effects of long term sleep reduction, as is frequently encountered in space exploration, on neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and circulating growth factors. Astronaut sleep is frequently curtailed to averages of between 4- 6.5 hours per night. There is evidence that this amount of sleep is inadequate for maintaining optimal daytime functioning. However, there is a lack of information concerning the effects of chronic sleep restriction, or reduction, on regulatory physiology in general, and there have been no controlled studies of the cumulative effects of chronic sleep reduction on neuroendocrine and neuroimmune parameters. This synergy project represents a pilot study designed to characterize the effects of chronic partial sleep deprivation (PSD) on neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and growth factors. This project draws its subjects from two (of 18) conditions of the larger NSBRI project, ""Countermeasures to Neurobehavioral Deficits from Cumulative Partial Sleep Deprivation During Space Flight"", one of the projects on the ""Human Performance Factors, Sleep and Chronobiology Team "". For the purposes of this study, to investigate the effects of chronic sleep loss on neuroendocrine and neuroimmune function, we have focused on the two extreme sleep conditions from this larger study: a 4.2 hour per night condition, and a 8.2 hour per night condition. During space flight, muscle mass and bone density are reduced, apparently due to loss of GH and IGF-I, associated with microgravity. Since >70% of growth hormone (GH) is secreted at night in normal adults, we hypothesized that the chronic sleep restriction to 4 hours per night would reduce GH levels as measured in the periphery. In this synergy project, in collaboration with the ""Muscle Alterations and Atrophy Team "", we are measuring insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in peripheral circulation to test the prediction that it will be reduced by chronic sleep restriction. In addition to stress modulation of immune function, recent research suggests that sleep is also involved. While we all have the common experience of being sleepy when suffering from infection, and being susceptible to infection when not getting enough sleep, the mechanisms involved in this process are not understood and until recently have gone largely overlooked. We believe that the immune function changes seen in spaceflight may also be related to the cumulative effects of sleep loss. Moreover, in space flight, the possibility of compromised immune function or of the reactivation of latent viruses are serious potential hazards for the success of long term missions. Confined living conditions, reduced sleep, altered diet and stress are all factors that may compromise immune function, thereby increasing the risks of developing and transmitting disease. Medical complications, which would not pose serious problems on earth, may be disastrous if they emerged in space.","[{""submissionId"":20000029495,""id"":""0663d0035a9e4dfea1e9008af1f489f1"",""publicationName"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute"",""publicationDate"":""1999-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""},{""id"":20000029456,""title"":""National Space Biomedical Research Institute""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20000029495
19990047433,OTHER,"Comparison of Gait During Treadmill Exercise While Supine in Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP), Supine with Bungee Resistance and Upright in Normal Gravity","[""Boda, Wanda"",""Hargens, Alan R."",""Aratow, Michael"",""Ballard, Richard E."",""Hutchinson, Karen"",""Murthy, Gita"",""Campbell, James""]","The purpose of this study is to compare footward forces, gait kinematics, and muscle activation patterns (EMG) generated during supine treadmill exercise against LBNP with the same parameters during supine bungee resistance exercise and upright treadmill exercise. We hypothesize that the three conditions will be similar. These results will help validate treadmill exercise during LBNP as a viable technique to simulate gravity during space flight. We are evaluating LBNP as a means to load the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems without gravity. Such loading should help prevent physiologic deconditioning during space flight. The best ground-based simulation of LBNP treadmill exercise in microgravity is supine LBNP treadmill exercise on Earth because the supine footward force vector is neither directed nor supplemented by Earth's gravity. Previous results from HR-95 (""Dynamics of footward force and leg intramuscular pressure during exercise against supine LBNP and upright standing in normal gravity"") indicate that supine plantar-/dorsiflexion exercise in LBNP at 100 mm Hg produces similar ground reaction forces, musculoskeletal stress, and VO2 to those during upright exercise against Earth's gravity. However, elevations of leg volume and heart rate indicate that cardiovascular stress during 100 mm Hg LBNP exercise exceeds that during 1 g exercise. Therefore, the need arose to reduce the cardiovascular stress of LBNP, while maintaining LBNP-induced reaction forces. To this end, we determined that mild plantar-/dorsiflexion exercise during LBNP significantly improves tolerance to LBNP via musculovenous pumping and sympathoexcitation; more intense exercise such as walking and running may further improve LBNP tolerance. In addition, two methodological advances have permited us to simulate upright 1 g exercise better with supine LBNP exercise. First, a newly-designed waist seal allows decreased levels of LBNP (50-60 mm Hg) to produce a footward force equaling one body weight","[{""submissionId"":19990047433,""id"":""472980d6f73a4703adc630e24ac2bb1b"",""publicationDate"":""1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NCC2-930""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19990047433

L."",""Peters, B. T."",""Bloomberg, J.

Astronauts returning from space flight exhibit impaired ability to coordinate effective landing strategies when jumping from a platform to the ground. This study compares the jump strategies used by astronauts before and after flight, the changes to those strategies within a test session, and the recoveries in jump-down performance parameters across several postflight test sessions. These data were obtained as part of an ongoing interdisciplinary study (Functional Task Test, FTT) designed to evaluate both astronaut postflight functional performance and related physiological changes. METHODS Six astronauts from short-duration (Shuttle) and three from long-duration (International Space Station) flights performed 3 two-footed jumps from a platform 30 cm high. A force plate measured the ground reaction forces and center-of-pressure displacement from the landings. Muscle activation data were collected from the medial gastrocnemius and anterior tibialis of both legs using surface electromyography electrodes. Two load cells in the platform measured the load exerted by each foot during the takeoff phase of the jump. Data were collected in 2 preflight sessions, on landing day (Shuttle only), and 1, 6, and 30 days after flight. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Many of the astronauts tested were unable to maintain balance on their first postflight jump landing but recovered by the third jump, showing a learning progression in which the performance improvement could be attributed to adjustments of strategy on takeoff, landing, or both. Takeoff strategy changes were evident in air time (time between takeoff and landing), which was significantly reduced after flight, and also in increased asymmetry in foot latencies on takeoff. Landing modifications were seen in changes in ground reaction force curves. The results demonstrate astronauts adaptive capabilities and full performance recovery within days after flight.","[{""submissionId"":20100038359,""id"":""b29d55e228ab4f1685c6c427e6b93539"",""publicationDate"":""2010-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20100038359,""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Stockholm, Sweden"",""id"":""7cdbc80258594581926c6a289eccadac""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20100038359,""endDate"":""2011-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Stockholm, Sweden""}},""meetingId"":""92ec5bd7741a4ed1920677010a9e3a69"",""id"":""d39859e487ce416da134ca13fa66b64c""}],""name"":""18th IAA Humans in Space Symposium"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""92ec5bd7741a4ed1920677010a9e3a69"",""startDate"":""2011-04-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100038359
20110016265,ABSTRACT,Preflight and In-Flight Exercise Conditions for Astronauts on the International Space Station,"[""Guilliams, Mark E."",""Nieschwitz, Bruce"",""Hoellen, David"",""Loehr, Jim""]","The physiological demands of spaceflight require astronauts to have certain physical abilities. They must be able to perform routine and off-nominal physical work during flight and upon re-entry into a gravity environment to ensure mission success, such as an Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) or emergency egress. To prepare the astronauts for their mission, a Wyle Astronaut Strength Conditioning and Rehabilitation specialist (ASCR) works individually with the astronauts to prescribe preflight strength and conditioning programs and in-flight exercise, utilizing Countermeasure Systems (CMS) exercise hardware. PURPOSE: To describe the preflight and in-flight exercise programs for ISS crewmembers. METHODS: Approximately 2 years before a scheduled launch, an ASCR is assigned to each astronaut and physical training (PT) is routinely scheduled. Preflight PT of astronauts consists of carrying out strength, aerobic and general conditioning, employing the principles of periodization. Exercise programs are prescribed to the astronauts to account for their individual fitness levels, planned mission-specific tasks, areas of concern, and travel schedules. Additionally, astronauts receive instruction on how to operate CMS exercise hardware and receive training for microgravity-specific conditions. For example, astronauts are scheduled training sessions for the International Space Station (ISS) treadmill (TVIS) and cycle ergometer (CEVIS), as well as the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED). In-flight programs are designed to maintain or even improve the astronauts pre-flight levels of fitness, bone health, muscle strength, power and aerobic capacity. In-flight countermeasure sessions are scheduled in 2.5 h blocks, six days a week, which includes 1.5 h for resistive training and 1 h for aerobic exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Crewmembers reported the need for more scheduled time for preflight training. During flight, crewmembers have indicated that the in-flight exercise is sufficient, but would like more reliable and capable hardware.","[{""submissionId"":20110016265,""id"":""fa2a42e0c4454a36b9961ce0d06cc5f3"",""publicationDate"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20110016265,""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States"",""id"":""911def41330342a4ae1eaa6bbe83a31b""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20110016265,""endDate"":""2012-05-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Aerospace Medical Association"",""location"":""Alexandria, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""003d130c6603477b8cee5fb73b70c0a2"",""id"":""55ac7741c4d04f048680fee5c8c99a39""}],""name"":""83rd AsMA Annual Scientific Meeting"",""location"":""Atlanta, GA"",""id"":""003d130c6603477b8cee5fb73b70c0a2"",""startDate"":""2012-05-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110016265

The results from these experiments have begun to provide new insights into the effects of spaceflight on mammalian physiological systems. After RR-1-4, the Flight IACUC required inclusion of additional cage enrichment into the Rodent Habitats (RH) to ""enhance animal well-being by providing animals with sensory and motor stimulation, through structures and resources that facilitate the expression of species typical behaviors"". A Hut, in the form of a rigid, mesh igloo-like shelter was implemented beginning with RR-5. The potential influence of the Hut in the novel cage environment of RH on various spaceflight-sensitive physiological systems has not been fully explored. To understand the effects of the Hut, mice (female C57Bl/6J, 15wks) were housed in Vivarium cage (n=5), RH with Hut (n=5), No Hut (n=5), Nestlet (n=10), and Cocoon (n=10) for 7 weeks. There were no differences in weekly body mass or food consumption. Tail blood draw indicated no differences in plasma corticosterone levels, immune cell types, or IgA levels. 24hrs prior to euthanasia, Open Field (OF) and Novel Object (NO) tests were performed. There were no differences across groups, all mice engaged in thigmotaxis (arena wall proximity) in the OF over 50% of the recorded time, and thigmotaxis declined when a NO was introduced. Additional behavioral analysis from daily videos are in progress to quantify activity levels. Post-euthanasia, there were no differences in soleus muscle or adrenal gland mass. Analysis of distal femur cancellous revealed some differences in microarchitecture. These results show that introduction of the Hut may diminish differences observed between spaceflight and ground controls, warranting improved validation of Hut effects in space, and also underscore the value of thorough preflight, ground based testing.

R."",""Smith, S. M."",""Watenpaugh, D. E."",""Hargens, A. R.""]","Long-term exposure to microgravity can cause a severe musculoskeletal loss and cardiovascular deconditioning in astronauts. In this report, the effectiveness of combined supine treadmill exercise in a lower body negative pressure chamber (LBNPex) and flywheel resistive exercise (Rex) countermeasures was determined to prevent bone loss, reduced aerobic upright exercise capacity and reduced muscle strength. We hypothesized that exercise subjects (EX) would show less decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), peak oxygen consumption (VO2pk) and knee extensor strength (KES) than control subjects (CON). Sixteen healthy female subjects (34 plus or minus 4yrs, 164 plus or minus 6.5cm, 58 plus or minus 5kg; mean plus or minus SD) participated in a 60-d 6 degree head-down tilt bed rest (BR) study after providing written informed consent. Subjects were assigned to one of two groups: a non- exercising CON group or an EX group performing LBNPex 2-4 d/wk and Rex every 3rd-d. VO2pk was measured with a maximal, graded, upright treadmill test performed pre-BR and on 3-d after BR. BMD was assessed pre-BR and 3-d after BR by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry total body DEXA scan (DEXA; HOLOGIC QDR 4500 Elite ). A Cybex dynamometer was employed to measure the isokinetic KES before and 5-d after BR. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA were performed with time as the repeated factor. Statistical significance was set at p less than 0.05. CON experienced a significant decrease in BMD in the trochanter (PRE: 0.670 0.045; POST: 0.646 0.352 g(raised dot) per square centimeter) and in the whole hip (PRE: 0.894 0.059; POST: 0.858 0.057 g(raised dot) per square centimeter). BMD also decreased significantly in EX in the trochanter (PRE: 0.753 plus or minus 0.0617; POST: 0.741 plus or minus 0.061 g(raised dot) per square centimeter) and whole hip (PRE: 0.954 plus or minus 0.067; POST: 0.935 plus or minus 0.069 g(raised dot) per square centimeter). BMD losses were significantly less in EX than in CON subjects. VO2pk was significantly decreased in the CON after BR (PRE: 38.0 plus or minus 4.8; POST: 29.9 plus or minus 4.2 ml(raised dot) per kilogram per minute), but not in the EX (PRE: 39.0 plus or minus 2.0; POST: 37.8 plus or minus 1.9 ml(raised dot) per kilogram per minute). KES was significantly reduced by 30% in CON (PRE: 113 plus or minus 12; POST: 78 plus or minus 8 N-m), but was not different in EX (PRE: 126 plus or minus 25; POST: 115 plus or minus 25 N-m). The combination LBNPex and Rex during 60-d BR protects against cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning and may be an efficacious countermeasure for prolonged space flight.","[{""submissionId"":20060051868,""id"":""558b7ed3266946899bc093b032fb76b2"",""publicationDate"":""2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Germany"",""submissionId"":20060051868,""endDate"":""2006-10-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""3rd Germany-China Workshop on Microgravity and Space Life Sciences"",""location"":""Berlin"",""id"":""c1a3a545f6f64207bdae3bd25773d852"",""startDate"":""2006-10-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""DLR Proj. 50WB0223"",""NNJ04HF71G""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20060051868

20080029287,ABSTRACT,Space Life Sciences at NASA: Spaceflight Health Policy and Standards,"[""Davis, Jeffrey R."",""House, Nancy G.""]","In January 2005, the President proposed a new initiative, the Vision for Space Exploration. To accomplish the goals within the vision for space exploration, physicians and researchers at Johnson Space Center are establishing spaceflight health standards. These standards include fitness for duty criteria (FFD), permissible exposure limits (PELs), and permissible outcome limits (POLs). POLs delineate an acceptable maximum decrement or change in a physiological or behavioral parameter, as the result of exposure to the space environment. For example cardiovascular fitness for duty standards might be a measurable clinical parameter minimum that allows successful performance of all required duties. An example of a permissible exposure limit for radiation might be the quantifiable limit of exposure over a given length of time (e.g. life time radiation exposure). An example of a permissible outcome limit might be the length of microgravity exposure that would minimize bone loss. The purpose of spaceflight health standards is to promote operational and vehicle design requirements, aid in medical decision making during space missions, and guide the development of countermeasures. Standards will be based on scientific and clinical evidence including research findings, lessons learned from previous space missions, studies conducted in space analog environments, current standards of medical practices, risk management data, and expert recommendations. To focus the research community on the needs for exploration missions, NASA has developed the Bioastronautics Roadmap. The Bioastronautics Roadmap, NASA's approach to identification of risks to human space flight, revised baseline was released in February 2005. This document was reviewed by the Institute of Medicine in November 2004 and the final report was received in October 2005. The roadmap defines the most important research and operational needs that will be used to set policy, standards (define acceptable risk), and implement an overall Risk Management and Analysis process. Currently NASA is drafting spaceflight health standards for neurosensory alterations, space radiation exposure, behavioral health, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular fitness, immunological compromise, bone demineralization, and nutrition.","[{""submissionId"":20080029287,""id"":""3b521536aacc4f3891821e3cb3cb5669"",""publicationDate"":""2006-06-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Russia"",""submissionId"":20080029287,""endDate"":""2006-06-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""13th Conference on Space Biology and Aerospace Medicine"",""location"":""Moscow"",""id"":""39d81b4c3bab497aba75dfd2d30a08d0"",""startDate"":""2006-06-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080029287
20160014865,ABSTRACT,Next Steps Toward Understanding Human Habitation of Space: Environmental Impacts and Mechanisms,"[""Globus, Ruth""]","Entry into low earth orbit and beyond causes profound shifts in environmental conditions that have the potential to influence human productivity, long term health, and even survival. We now have evidence that microgravity, radiation and/or confinement in space can lead to demonstrably detrimental changes in the cardiovascular (e.g. vessel function, orthostatic intolerance), musculoskeletal (muscle atrophy, bone loss) and nervous (eye, neurovestibular) systems of astronauts. Because of both the limited number of astronauts who have flown (especially females) and the high degree of individual variability in the human population, important unanswered questions about responses to the space environment remain: What are the sex differences with respect to specific physiological systems? Are the responses age-dependent and/or reversible after return to Earth? Do observed detrimental changes that resemble accelerated aging progress continuously over time or plateau? What are the mechanisms of the biological responses? Answering these important questions certainly demands a multi-pronged approach, and the study of multicellular model organisms (such as rodents and flies) already has provided opportunities for exploring those questions in some detail. Recent long duration spaceflight experiments with rodents show that mice in space provide a mammalian model that uniquely combines the influence of reduced gravitational loading with increased physical activity. In addition, multiple investigators have shown that ground-based models that simulate aspects of spaceflight (including rodent hind limb unloading to mimic weightlessness and exposure to ionizing radiation), cause various transient and persistent detrimental consequences in multiple physiological systems. In general, we have found that adverse skeletal effects of simulated weightlessness and space radiation when combined, can be quantitatively, if not qualitatively, different from the influence of each environmental factor alone implying at least some shared underlying mechanisms. Thus, both ground based and spaceflight research utilizing model organisms provide the opportunity to better understand environmental factors and biological mechanisms that contribute to human health and survival in space.","[{""submissionId"":20160014865,""id"":""a77f7a1dae3c40918407902fd02f0302"",""publicationDate"":""2016-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160014865,""endDate"":""2016-10-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""c4c6527aca544cddb22005e8fe34cdde"",""id"":""e20bf972a9294438b1a8cf8c267c3d4a""}],""name"":""Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Cleveland, OH"",""id"":""c4c6527aca544cddb22005e8fe34cdde"",""startDate"":""2016-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""},{""submissionId"":20160014865,""name"":""American Society for Gravitational and Space Research"",""location"":""Bristow, VA, United States"",""id"":""229e519e6b594d85aa6afe46ce8363f2""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160014865
20040172692,REPRINT,Hindlimb unloading of growing rats: a model for predicting skeletal changes during space flight,"[""Morey-Holton, E. R."",""Globus, R. K.""]","A model that uses hindlimb unloading of rats was developed to study the consequences of skeletal unloading and reloading as occurs during and following space flight. Studies using the model were initiated two decades ago and further developed at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Ames Research Center. The model mimics some aspects of exposure to microgravity by removing weightbearing loads from the hindquarters and producing a cephalic fluid shift. Unlike space flight, the forelimbs remain loaded in the model, providing a useful internal control to distinguish between the local and systemic effects of hindlimb unloading. Rats that are hindlimb unloaded by tail traction gain weight at the same rate as pairfed controls, and glucocorticoid levels are not different from controls, suggesting that systemic stress is minimal. Unloaded bones display reductions in cancellous osteoblast number, cancellous mineral apposition rate, trabecular bone volume, cortical periosteal mineralization rate, total bone mass, calcium content, and maturation of bone mineral relative to controls. Subsequent studies reveal that these changes also occur in rats exposed to space flight. In hindlimb unloaded rats, bone formation rates and masses of unloaded bones decline relative to controls, while loaded bones do not change despite a transient reduction in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) concentrations. Studies using the model to evaluate potential countermeasures show that 1,25D, growth hormone, dietary calcium, alendronate, and muscle stimulation modify, but do not completely correct, the suppression of bone growth caused by unloading, whereas continuous infusion of transforming growth factor-beta2 or insulin-like growth factor-1 appears to protect against some of the bone changes caused by unloading. These results emphasize the importance of local as opposed to systemic factors in the skeletal response to unloading, and reveal the pivotal role that osteoblasts play in the response to gravitational loading. The hindlimb unloading model provides a unique opportunity to evaluate in detail the physiological and cellular mechanisms of the skeletal response to weightbearing loads, and has proven to be an effective model for space flight.","[{""volume"":""22"",""submissionId"":20040172692,""issue"":""5 Suppl"",""issn"":""8756-3282"",""id"":""dcfe6e14c5df482a97ec3f3ebf1ffd77"",""publicationName"":""Bone"",""publicationDate"":""1998-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040172692

20160010579,PRESENTATION,Advances in Rodent Research Missions on the International Space Station,"[""Choi, S. Y."",""Ronca, A."",""Leveson-Gower, D."",""Gong, C."",""Stube, K."",""Pletcher, D."",""Wigley, C."",""Beegle, J."",""Globus, R. K.""]","A research platform for rodent experiment on the ISS is a valuable tool for advancing biomedical research in space. Capabilities offered by the Rodent Research project developed at NASA Ames Research Center can support experiments of much longer duration on the ISS than previous experiments performed on the Space Shuttle. NASAs Rodent Research (RR)-1 mission was completed successfully and achieved a number of objectives, including validation of flight hardware, on-orbit operations, and science capabilities as well as support of a CASIS-sponsored experiment (Novartis) on muscle atrophy. Twenty C57BL6J adult female mice were launched on the Space-X (SpX) 4 Dragon vehicle, and thrived for up to 37 days in microgravity. Daily health checks of the mice were performed during the mission via downlinked video; all flight animals were healthy and displayed normal behavior, and higher levels of physical activity compared to ground controls. Behavioral analysis demonstrated that Flight and Ground Control mice exhibited the same range of behaviors, including eating, drinking, exploratory behavior, self- and allo-grooming, and social interactions indicative of healthy animals. The animals were euthanized on-orbit and select tissues were collected from some of the mice on orbit to assess the long-term sample storage capabilities of the ISS. In general, the data obtained from the flight mice were comparable to those from the three groups of control mice (baseline, vivarium and ground controls, which were housed in flight hardware), showing that the ISS has adequate capability to support long-duration rodent experiments. The team recovered 35 tissues from 40 RR-1 frozen carcasses, yielding 3300 aliquots of tissues to distribute to the scientific community in the U.S., including NASAs GeneLab project and scientists via Space Biology's Biospecimen Sharing Program Ames Life Science Data Archive. Tissues also were distributed to Russian research colleagues at the Institute for Biomedical Problems. The expression levels of select genes including albumin, catalase, GAPDH, HMGCoA Reductase, and IGF1 were determined using RNA isolated from the livers by qPCR and no significant differences by one factor ANOVA were found between flight and ground control groups. In addition, some of the liver samples were analyzed for transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic profiles; some of the data sets are now available to the scientific community through GeneLabs open science data website. A second long duration mission, Rodent Research-2 (RR-2) was completed on the ISS in 2015; 20 female C57BL6J mice were successfully maintained on the ISS for various durations, with the last group of 5 animals living on-orbit for 54 days. Furthermore, we continue to expand the ISSs capabilities by introducing new on-orbit technologies including blood collection and separation, bone densitometry scanning, muscle grip strength and anesthesia with recovery. In addition, series of ground-based verification testing to fly male mice and increase the total number of mice on-orbit from 20 to 40. Subsequent missions will provide the capability to return live mice from the ISS animals to evaluate recovery on Earth, further expanding operational and science capabilities of the RR project on the ISS.","[{""submissionId"":20160010579,""id"":""189d1a5b3dbd487eb29fb21e7643f1be"",""publicationDate"":""2016-07-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160010579,""name"":""American Astronomical Society"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States"",""id"":""eeb35ab230e94997ae96dcb0f5652e2a""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160010579,""endDate"":""2016-07-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American Astronomical Society"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9d17b808286d4816aa2ade359efdbab0"",""id"":""2c1cd83b11ad4394be9d7b3fcc0a0cc7""},{""organizationId"":""92cda829ce654e64a92fab1f1011640d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS)"",""location"":""Melbourne, FL, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9d17b808286d4816aa2ade359efdbab0"",""id"":""93e1040dd3ba4b6ca1a88bbcbdea51ec""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""9d17b808286d4816aa2ade359efdbab0"",""id"":""07d7969c88884a0594a69733c6fd5301""}],""name"":""ISS R and D Conference 2016"",""location"":""San Diego, CA"",""id"":""9d17b808286d4816aa2ade359efdbab0"",""startDate"":""2016-07-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NNA14AB82C""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)"",""Space Sciences (General)""]","[{""id"":20190029061,""title"":""Advances in Rodent Research Missions on the International Space Station""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160010579

Some or all of these changes might affect the ability of crewmembers to perform critical mission tasks immediately after landing on a planetary surface. The goal of our recently completed Functional Task Test (FTT) study was to determine the effects of spaceflight on functional tests that are representative of high priority exploration mission tasks and to identify the key underlying physiological factors that contribute to decrements in performance. The FTT is comprised of seven functional tests and a corresponding set of interdisciplinary physiological measures specifically targeting the sensorimotor, cardiovascular and muscular changes associated with exposure to spaceflight. Both Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) astronauts were tested before and after spaceflight. Additionally, we conducted a supporting study in which subjects performed the FTT protocol before and after 70 days of 6 deg head-down bed rest, an analog for spaceflight. Two groups of bed rest subjects were studied: one group who performed aerobic and resistive exercise during bed rest using protocols similar to astronauts and one group who served as non-exercise controls. The bed rest analog allowed us to isolate the impact of body unloading without other spaceflight environmental factors on both functional tasks and on the underlying physiological factors that lead to decrements in performance, and then to compare those results with the results obtained in our spaceflight study. As an extension to the FTT study we collected data from one ISS crewmember who experienced 340 days in space using the same FTT protocol used previously to test spaceflight and bed rest subjects. Data were collected three times preflight and 1.7, 7.5 and 36.5 days after landing. The FTT one-year results will be presented at the meeting, and a comparison will be made with data previously obtained using the same protocol on astronauts tested before and after 6 months in space. Future work will focus on collecting data from additional subjects from one-year flights to gain a better assessment of extreme long-duration exposure to spaceflight on both functional measure of performance and physiological metrics.","[{""submissionId"":20160013694,""id"":""f31238e3b2524eb99a9aca84770eeb7f"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160013694,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""0bba4b66c88d4f6b9af09a68495f6606"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Headquarters"",""location"":""Washington, DC, United States""}},""meetingId"":""d6f12e2ebdf24fde8ec051850c5d3e94"",""id"":""827af03195ee45ed903b99831590424a""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2017)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""d6f12e2ebdf24fde8ec051850c5d3e94"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20170001370,""title"":""The Functional Task Test: Results from the One-Year Mission""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160013694
20230001734,CONFERENCE_PAPER,Female Astronauts Exhibit Greater Reductions in Aerobic Peak Power Following Long-Duration Space Flight than Males,"[""Nicole C Strock"",""Alyssa N Varanoske"",""Brian J Prejean"",""Dillon Frisco"",""Karina Marshall Goebel""]","BACKGROUND: Long-duration exposure to microgravity during space flight causes cardiovascular deconditioning, ultimately reducing aerobic fitness. While sex-based differences play an integral role in health on Earth, there is a paucity of data to inform space flight-induced health and performance implications for female astronauts, which may be critical to ensure health, safety, and mission success. Therefore, this retrospective investigation characterized aerobic capacity in female and male astronauts to inform whether sex differences exist from pre to postflight.

METHODS: A NASA historical database (n=47 crew; 11 female, 36 male) of International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers was used to characterize sex differences in aerobic capacity changes from pre to postflight to update the NASA Aerobic and Muscle Risk Evidence Report. Aerobic capacity (VO2pk; ml/kg/min) and peak power (W) were assessed using a graded cycling exercise protocol that included a 3-min warmup at 50 W, with stepwise increases in resistance (25 W/min) until volitional fatigue. Group differences in baseline demographics and the percent change in aerobic capacity from preflight (~90 days before launch) to postflight (~3 days after return) were compared using independent t-tests. Significance was set at P<0.05 (Mean ±SD). 

RESULTS: At preflight, females were younger (44.5±6.6 vs 48.6±5.6 yrs; p=0.041), weighed less (68.8±10.0 vs 81.0±8.8 kg; p< 0.001), with lower VO2pk (32.8±5.9 vs 37.8±6.0 ml/kg/min; p=0.021) and aerobic peak power (229±42 vs 299±52 W; p< 0.001) than males, but had similar heart rate at VO2pk (176.0±7.3 vs 173.0±10.8 beats/min; p=0.406). ISS flight durations (F: 205.0±58.3 vs M: 176.0±40.5 days; p=0.061) and reductions in VO2pk from pre to postflight were comparable between sexes (F: -11.8±10.7%; M: -8.8%±7.9%; p=0.32). However, females had a greater reduction in aerobic peak power than males (−13.3%±8.9% vs −4.9%±8.8%; p < 0.01). 

CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that some indicators of fitness (i.e., aerobic peak power) are more impacted in female astronauts compared to males after long-duration space flight missions. Future investigations with larger sample sizes are necessary to identify the physiological basis of sex-based differences and develop effective countermeasure approaches for both sexes.","[{""submissionId"":20230001734,""id"":""30f1f1c637724a4aa943f69842003811"",""publicationDate"":""2023-05-30T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""US"",""submissionId"":20230001734,""endDate"":""2023-06-02T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""f106d71f5c665186944d14917634b240"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""American College of Sports Medicine"",""location"":""Indianapolis, Indiana, United States""}},""meetingId"":""1022bc7f304f4534a50852789d106a16"",""id"":""65fe336026bb4d5699deb17479041e32""}],""name"":""2023 ACSM Annual Meeting & World Congresses"",""location"":""Denver, CO"",""id"":""1022bc7f304f4534a50852789d106a16"",""url"":""https://www.acsm.org/annual-meeting/annual-home"",""startDate"":""2023-05-30T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""10449.2.03.07.01.0978"",""NNJ15HK11B""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230001734

A."",""Brady, R."",""Bloomberg, Jacob J.""]","Astronauts returning from space flight show disturbances in locomotor control manifested by changes in various sub-systems including head-trunk coordination, dynamic visual acuity, lower limb muscle activation patterning and kinematics (Glasauer, et al., 1995; Bloomberg, et al., 1997; McDonald, et al., 1996; 1997; Layne, et al., 1997; 1998, 2001, 2004; Newman, et al., 1997; Bloomberg and Mulavara, 2003). These post flight changes in locomotor performance, due to neural adaptation to the microgravity conditions of space flight, affect the ability of crewmembers especially after a long duration mission to egress their vehicle and perform extravehicular activities soon after landing on Earth or following a landing on the surface of the Moon or Mars. At present, no operational training intervention is available pre- or in- flight to mitigate post flight locomotor disturbances. Our laboratory is currently developing a gait adaptability training program that is designed to facilitate recovery of locomotor function following a return to a gravitational environment. The training program exploits the ability of the sensorimotor system to generalize from exposure to multiple adaptive challenges during training so that the gait control system essentially ""learns to learn"" and therefore can reorganize more rapidly when faced with a novel adaptive challenge. Ultimately, the functional goal of an adaptive generalization countermeasure is not necessarily to immediately return movement patterns back to ""normal"". Rather the training regimen should facilitate the reorganization of available sensorimotor sub-systems to achieve safe and effective locomotion as soon as possible after space flight. We have previously confirmed that subjects participating in adaptive generalization training programs, using a variety of visuomotor distortions and different motor tasks from throwing to negotiating an obstacle course as the dependent measure, can learn to enhance their ability to adapt to a novel sensorimotor environment (Roller et al., 2001; Cohen et al. 2005). Importantly, this increased adaptability is retained even one month after completion of the training period. Our laboratory is currently developing adaptive generalization training procedures and the associated flight hardware to implement such a training program, using variations of visual flow, subject loading, and treadmill speed; during regular in-flight treadmill operations.","[{""submissionId"":20070003722,""id"":""538f6b15594c40eabda5e9938659c169"",""publicationDate"":""2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20070003722,""endDate"":""2007-02-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""24th Annual Houston Conference on Biomedical"",""location"":""Houston, TX"",""id"":""015bbf1b617b4055ac9cd940ff02d54a"",""startDate"":""2007-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,"[""NCC9-58""]",undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20070003722

E."",""Gadd, N."",""Taylor, L."",""Peters, B. T."",""Allen, E."",""Reschke, M. F."",""Bloomberg, J. J."",""Mulavara, A. P.""]","Microgravity exposure results in an adaptive central reinterpretation of information from multiple sensory sources to produce a sensorimotor state appropriate for motor actions in this unique environment, but this new adaptive state is no longer appropriate for the 1-g gravitational environment on Earth. During these gravitational transitions, astronauts experience deficits in both perceptual and motor functions including impaired postural control, disruption in spatial orientation, impaired control of locomotion that include alterations in muscle activation variability, modified lower limb kinematics, alterations in head-trunk coordination as well as reduced dynamic visual acuity. Post-flight changes in postural and locomotor control might have adverse consequences if a rapid egress was required following a long-duration mission, where support personnel may not be available to aid crewmembers. The act of emergency egress includes, but is not limited to standing, walking, climbing a ladder, jumping down, monitoring displays, actuating discrete controls, operating auxiliary equipment, and communicating with Mission Control and recovery teams while maintaining spatial orientation, mobility and postural stability in order to escape safely. The average time to recover impaired postural control and functional mobility to preflight levels of performance has been shown to be approximately two weeks after long-duration spaceflight. The postflight alterations are due in part to central reinterpretation of vestibular information caused by exposure to microgravity. In this study we will use a commonly used technique of transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied across the vestibular end organs (galvanic vestibular stimulation, GVS) to disrupt vestibular function as a simulation of post-flight disturbances. The goal of this project is an engineering human-in-the-loop evaluation of a device that can degrade performance of functional tasks (e.g. to maintain upright balance) similar to what astronauts experience during transitions to new gravitational environments. Stochastic electrical stimulation can be applied to the vestibular system through electrodes placed over the mastoid process behind the ears in the binaural configuration resulting in stimulation in the mediolateral (side-to-side) plane. An additional electrode can be placed over the bony landmark of the tip of the c7 spinous process for the double monaural configuration, which will cause stimulation in the anteroposterior (forward-backward) plane. A portable constant current bipolar stimulator with subject isolation was designed and built to deliver the stimulus. The unit is powered using a 3.7 V battery pack and designed to produce currents up to 5 mA. The stimulator, controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3 computer, offers several stimulus signal generation options including a standalone mode, which uses onboard signal files stored on the flash memory card. Stochastic stimulation signals will be generated in 0-30 Hz frequency bandwidth. Stimulation amplitude can be increased incrementally to a maximum amplitude of 5.0 mA (e.g., 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 mA). In control trials, subjects will be experiencing vestibular stimulation with 0-mA current applied through the electrodes. The system will be evaluated at various levels of stimulation and in both the binaural and double monaural electrode configurations. One of the objectives is to identify stimulation levels producing effects most comparable to the post-flight disturbances. This is a pilot study that will set the stage for a larger, more comprehensive study that will investigate wider aspects of post-flight sensorimotor dysfunction and set sensorimotor standards for crew health.","[{""submissionId"":20160013701,""id"":""da7ad66e4e3140959acf9263ca1d2f09"",""publicationDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20160013701,""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""c4745ff0b4844f8ab6ee38c7f51d81d5""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20160013701,""endDate"":""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""NASA Johnson Space Center"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""df64c3d626ad4382a3bd0c3a0aa8f963"",""id"":""c39c3d8aaf564645a055e52c41b61db6""}],""name"":""Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop (HRP IWS 2017)"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""df64c3d626ad4382a3bd0c3a0aa8f963"",""startDate"":""2017-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine"",""Computer Programming And Software""]","[{""id"":20170001373,""title"":""Evaluation of Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation System""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160013701
20140003753,ABSTRACT,Biomechanics of the Treadmill Locomotion on the International Space Station,"[""DeWitt, John"",""Cromwell, R. L."",""Ploutz-Snyder, L. L.""]","Exercise prescriptions completed by International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers are typically based upon evidence obtained during ground-based investigations, with the assumption that the results of long-term training in weightlessness will be similar to that attained in normal gravity. Coupled with this supposition are the assumptions that exercise motions and external loading are also similar between gravitational environments. Normal control of locomotion is dependent upon learning patterns of muscular activation and requires continual monitoring of internal and external sensory input [1]. Internal sensory input includes signals that may be dependent on or independent of gravity. Bernstein hypothesized that movement strategy planning and execution must include the consideration of segmental weights and inertia [2]. Studies of arm movements in microgravity showed that individuals tend to make errors but that compensation strategies result in adaptations, suggesting that control mechanisms must include peripheral information [3-5]. To date, however, there have been no studies examining a gross motor activity such as running in weightlessness other than using microgravity analogs [6-8]. The objective of this evaluation was to collect biomechanical data from crewmembers during treadmill exercise before and during flight. The goal was to determine locomotive biomechanics similarities and differences between normal and weightless environments. The data will be used to optimize future exercise prescriptions. This project addresses the Critical Path Roadmap risks 1 (Accelerated Bone Loss and Fracture Risk) and 11 (Reduced Muscle Mass, Strength, and Endurance). Data were collected from 7 crewmembers before flight and during their ISS missions. Before launch, crewmembers performed a single data collection session at the NASA Johnson Space Center. Three-dimensional motion capture data were collected for 30 s at speeds ranging from 1.5 to 9.5 mph in 0.5 mph increments with a 12-camera system. During flight, each crewmember completed up to 6 data collection sessions spread across their missions, performing their normal exercise prescription for the test day, resulting in varying data collection protocols between sessions. Motion data were collected by a single HD video camera positioned to view the crewmembers' left side, and tape markers were placed on their feet, legs, and neck on specific landmarks. Before data collection, the crewmembers calibrated the video camera. Video data were collected during the entire exercise session at 30 Hz. Kinematic data were used to determine left leg hip, knee, and ankle range of motion and contact time, flight time, and stride time for each stride. 129 trials in weightlessness were analyzed. Mean time-normalized strides were found for each trial, and cross-correlation procedures were used to examine the strength and direction of relationships between segment movement pattern timing in each gravitational condition. Cross-correlation analyses between gravitational conditions revealed highly consistent movement patterns at each joint. Peak correlation coefficients occurred at 0% phase, indicating there were no lags in movement timing. Joint ranges of motion were similar between gravitational conditions, with some slight differences between subjects. Motion patterns in weightlessness were highly consistent at a given speed with those occurring in 1G, indicating that despite differing sensory input, subjects maintain running kinematics. The data suggest that individuals are capable of compensating for loss of limb weight when creating movement strategies. These results have important implications for creating training programs for use in weightlessness as practitioners can have greater confidence in running motions transferring across gravitational environments. Furthermore, these results have implications for use by researchers investigating motor control mechanisms and investigating hypotheses related to movement strategies when using sensory input that is dependent upon gravity.","[{""submissionId"":20140003753,""id"":""85da91dd4a6e44f29a9a7003c9d941f4"",""publicationDate"":""2014-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20140003753,""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States"",""id"":""a00555dba65e4ca88ec02b162e9dcc08""},{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20140003753,""endDate"":""2014-02-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""8ccaff322ecb48d2811364bf91d9f59d"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""National Space Biomedical Research Inst."",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f9d3c303b67f4ac8b32352635c23f41f"",""id"":""4f50b3fa24364d659773865217c74b5f""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Universities Space Research Association"",""location"":""Houston, TX, United States""}},""meetingId"":""f9d3c303b67f4ac8b32352635c23f41f"",""id"":""0038cfdc1be74bec8098138154a21048""}],""name"":""NASA Human Research Program Investigators Workshop 2014"",""location"":""Galveston, TX"",""id"":""f9d3c303b67f4ac8b32352635c23f41f"",""startDate"":""2014-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20140012907,""title"":""Biomechanics of Treadmill Locomotion on the International Space Station: Does Gravity Influence Running Biomechanics?""},{""id"":20140012907,""title"":""Biomechanics of Treadmill Locomotion on the International Space Station: Does Gravity Influence Running Biomechanics?""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140003753

Changes in muscle function and functional mobility have been reported to be associated with bed rest. Understanding the effect of bed rest on neural control of movement would provide helpful information for spaceflight. In the current study, we evaluated how the brain activation for foot movement changed as a function of bed rest. Eighteen healthy men (aged 25 to 39 years) participated in this HDBR study. They remained continuously in the 6deg head‐down tilt position for 70 days. Functional MRI was acquired during 1‐Hz right foot tapping, and repeated at 7 time points: 12 days pre‐, 8 days pre‐, 7 days in‐, 50 days in‐, 70 days in‐, 8 days post‐, and 12 days post‐ HDBR. In all 7 sessions, we observed increased activation in the left motor cortex, right cerebellum and right occipital cortex during foot movement blocks compared to rest. Compared to the pre‐HDBR baseline (1st and 2nd sessions), foot movement‐induced activation in the left hippocampus increased during HDBR. This increase emerged in the 4th session, enlarged in the 5th session, and remained significant in the 6th and 7th sessions. Furthermore, increased activation relative to the baseline in left precuneus was observed in the 5th, 6th and 7th sessions. In addition, in comparison with baseline, increased activation in the left cerebellum was found in the 4th and 5th sessions, whereas increased activation in the right cerebellum was observed in the 4th, 6th and 7th sessions. No brain region exhibited decreased activation during bed rest compared to baseline. The increase of foot movement related brain activation during HDBR suggests that in a long‐term head‐down position, more neural control is needed to accomplish foot movements. This change required a couple of weeks to develop in HDBR (between 3rd and 4th sessions), and did not return to baseline even 12 days after HDBR.

20120007361,OTHER,Improving Balance Function Using Low Levels of Electrical Stimulation of the Balance Organs,"[""Bloomberg, Jacob"",""Reschke, Millard"",""Mulavara, Ajitkumar"",""Wood, Scott"",""Serrador, Jorge"",""Fiedler, Matthew"",""Kofman, Igor"",""Peters, Brian T."",""Cohen, Helen""]","Crewmembers returning from long-duration space flight face significant challenges due to the microgravity-induced inappropriate adaptations in balance/sensorimotor function. The Neuroscience Laboratory at JSC is developing a method based on stochastic resonance to enhance the brain's ability to detect signals from the balance organs of the inner ear and use them for rapid improvement in balance skill, especially when combined with balance training exercises. This method involves a stimulus delivery system that is wearable/portable and provides imperceptible electrical stimulation to the balance organs of the human body. Stochastic resonance (SR) is a phenomenon whereby the response of a nonlinear system to a weak periodic input signal is optimized by the presence of a particular non-zero level of noise. This phenomenon of SR is based on the concept of maximizing the flow of information through a system by a non-zero level of noise. Application of imperceptible SR noise coupled with sensory input in humans has been shown to improve motor, cardiovascular, visual, hearing, and balance functions. SR increases contrast sensitivity and luminance detection; lowers the absolute threshold for tone detection in normal hearing individuals; improves homeostatic function in the human blood pressure regulatory system; improves noise-enhanced muscle spindle function; and improves detection of weak tactile stimuli using mechanical or electrical stimulation. SR noise has been shown to improve postural control when applied as mechanical noise to the soles of the feet, or when applied as electrical noise at the knee and to the back muscles. SR using imperceptible stochastic electrical stimulation of the vestibular system (stochastic vestibular stimulation, SVS) applied to normal subjects has shown to improve the degree of association between the weak input periodic signals introduced via venous blood pressure receptors and the heart-rate responses. Also, application of SVS over 24 hours improves the long-term heart-rate dynamics and motor responsiveness as indicated by daytime trunk activity measurements in patients with multi-system atrophy, Parkinson s disease, or both, including patients who were unresponsive to standard therapy for Parkinson s disease. Recent studies conducted at the NASA JSC Neurosciences Laboratories showed that imperceptible SVS, when applied to normal young healthy subjects, leads to significantly improved balance performance during postural disturbances on unstable compliant surfaces. These studies have shown the benefit of SR noise characteristic optimization with imperceptible SVS in the frequency range of 0-30 Hz, and amplitudes of stimulation have ranged from 100 to 400 microamperes.","[{""submissionId"":20120007361,""id"":""a56f855349d845a096789a02bd0d214a"",""publicationName"":""NASA Tech Briefs, April 2012"",""publicationDate"":""2012-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]","[{""id"":20120007358,""title"":""NASA Tech Briefs, April 2012""},{""id"":20120007358,""title"":""NASA Tech Briefs, April 2012""}]",https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120007361

E."",""Rovekamp, R. N."",""Rea, R. L."",""Ploutz-Snyder, L. L.""]","Pre- and post-flight dynamometry is performed on International Space Station crewmembers to characterize microgravity-induced strength changes. Strength is not assessed in flight due to hardware limitations and there is poor understanding of the time course of in-flight changes. PURPOSE: To assess the reliability of a prototype dynamometer, the X1 Exoskeleton (EXO) and its agreement with a Biodex System 4 (BIO). METHODS: Eight subjects (4 M/4 F) completed 2 counterbalanced testing sessions of knee extension/flexion (KE/KF), 1 with BIO and 1 with EXO, with repeated measures within each session in normal gravity. Test-retest reliability (test 1 and 2) and device agreement (BIO vs. EXO) were evaluated. Later, to assess device agreement for ankle plantarflexion (PF), 10 subjects (4 M/6 F) completed 3 test conditions (BIO, EXO, and BIOEXO); BIOEXO was a hybrid condition comprised of the Biodex dynamometer motor and the X1 footplate and ankle frame. Ankle comparisons were: BIO vs. BIOEXO (footplate differences), BIOEXO vs. EXO (motor differences), and BIO vs. EXO (all differences). Reliability for KE/KF was determined by intraclass correlation (ICC). Device agreement was assessed with: 1) repeated measures ANOVA, 2) a measure of concordance (rho), and 3) average difference. RESULTS: ICCs for KE/KF were 0.99 for BIO and 0.96 to 0.99 for EXO. Agreement was high for KE (concordance: 0.86 to 0.95; average differences: -7 to +9 Nm) and low to moderate for KF (concordance: 0.64 to 0.78; average differences: -4 to -29 Nm, P<0.05). BIO vs. BIOEXO PF concordance ranged from 0.89 to 0.92 and mean differences ranged from -9 to +3 Nm (BIO < BIOEXO). BIOEXO vs. EXO PF concordance ranged from 0.73 to 0.80 while mean differences were -18 to -36 Nm (BIOEXO < EXO, P<0.05). PF concordance for BIO vs. EXO was slightly lower (0.61 to 0.84) and mean differences were greater (-27 to -33 Nm; BIO < EXO, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: BIO and EXO were similarly reliable for KE and KF. KE measures produced high agreement between devices; KF did not. For ankle PF, torque differences due to the two footplates were small. However, the X1 motor reports greater torques than the Biodex motor during PF. This first prototype provides proof of concept for a reliable, robotic-based exoskeleton to perform portable dynamometry for large muscle groups of the lower body.","[{""submissionId"":20140003281,""id"":""9609265d4e9349558c15e61318105055"",""publicationDate"":""2014-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140003281
20050220667,EXTENDED_ABSTRACT,Pharmacotherapeutic Aspects of Space Medicine,"[""Putcha, Lakshmi""]","Medications are used for a wide variety of indications during space flight. For example, astronauts have taken drugs in flight to ameliorate or prevent symptoms of space motion sickness, headache, sleeplessness, backache, nasal congestion, and constipation. Russian cosmonauts reportedly take medications to prevent metabolic disturbances of the myocardium and intestinal flora, and to optimize their work capacity. Although the discomfort associated with some acute responses to microgravity (e.g., space motion sickness) is expected to diminish with length of time in flight, other responses that have delayed onset (e.g., maintaining nutritional status, bone and muscle strength, and perhaps immune response) may affect health and quality of life during longer missions. Therefore, as the duration of space flights increases, the need for treatment with medications is expected to increase accordingly. Medications carried on Space Shuttle missions have varied somewhat from flight to flight, depending on the individual needs of the crewmembers. Medications use during Shuttle flights seems to be more prevalent than during earlier programs, perhaps because drugs are provided in easy-to-use forms. In fact, nearly all medications taken to date have been ingested orally in tablet form. However, given that the oral route may not be ideal for those suffering motion-sickness symptoms, intramuscular and intranasal preparations are being tested. For example, intramuscular administration of promethazine hydrochloride (Phenergan(Registered TradeMark)) has been reported to be more effective in alleviating motion-sickness symptoms. The difficulties involved in conducting definitive studies of drug efficacy during U.S. space flights have been compounded by the absence of a systematic approach to determining which drugs were taken by whom and under what circumstances. The use of some drugs in space has been less efficacious than expected. The onset, intensity, and duration of the response produced by any drug depend upon rates of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the drug; space flight-induced changes in blood flow and the function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver, or kidneys may alter these processes. Another important aspect of clinical efficacy of medications in space is the stability of pharmaceuticals. As the U.S. space program is moving toward extended Space Shuttle flights and beyond, to space station missions and planetary explorations, understanding how space flight affects organ systems and clinical pharmacology is necessary to optimize pharmacotherapeutics in space and ensure adequate safety and health of crewmembers.","[{""submissionId"":20050220667,""id"":""e4dc7e9ecd3b45dc80c36cfc1e14c0ee"",""publicationDate"":""2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20050220667,""endDate"":""2004-04-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""2db1da2c56254c0288a18464a311a9d8"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Center for Advanced Studies in the Space Life Sciences"",""location"":""Woods Hole, MA, United States""}},""meetingId"":""97343fdf8d5144b0acdc6610a7e3bcb3"",""id"":""9796e4d25c7a4add81a98cdb25926155""}],""name"":""Animal Research in Support of Human Space Exploration"",""location"":""Woods Hole, MA"",""id"":""97343fdf8d5144b0acdc6610a7e3bcb3"",""startDate"":""2004-04-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050220667
20090039033,ABSTRACT,Gender-related Changes in Dorsal Hand and Foot Vein Function Following 60 Days of Head Down Bed Rest,"[""Westby, Christian M."",""Phillips, Tiffany"",""Stenger, Michael B."",""Platts, Steven H.""]","It is well known that female astronauts are more likely to experience post-flight orthostatic hypotension and presyncope compared to male astronauts. It has been suggested that the disproportionally higher incidence of presyncope (83% of female vs. 20% male crewmembers) may be due to sex-related differences in vascular function between the upper and lower limbs. However, much of this evidence is specific to changes in resistance vessels. Given that more than 70% of the circulating blood volume resides in compliance vessels, it is conceivable that even small changes in venous function may contribute to post-flight orthostatic hypotension. In spite of this, little is currently known regarding the influence of microgravity exposure on venous function between males and females. PURPOSE: To determine the influence of 60 days of HDBR on dorsal foot and hand vein function between healthy males (M) and females (F). METHODS: Using 2-D ultrasound, dorsal hand and foot vein diameter responses to intravenous infusions phenylephrine (PE), acetylcholine (ACh), and nitroglycerine (NTG) were determined in 26 adults; 10 females (age:37 +/- 2 yr ) and 16 males (age:34 +/- 2 yr ). Changes in venous function were calculated as the difference between diameter at baseline and following each venoactive drug. Differences in venous function between limb and sexes across HDBR were determined using mixed-effects linear regression. RESULTS: In response to 60 days of HDBR, the change in venousconstrictor response to PE in the dorsal hand veins was not significantly different between M and F. Interestingly, the change in constrictor response in the dorsal foot veins (compared to pre HDBR) was approximately 30% greater in the F, whereas the constrictor response was approximately 45% less in the M (p=0.026). HDBR had no influence on the change in dilator response to ACh, or NTG between M and F and between vascular beds. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that 60 days of HDBR contributes to sex-related differences in venous function. Importantly, the changes are specific to dorsal foot veins and do not appear to be related to changes in endothelial or smooth muscle function. Previous data from our laboratory indicate that females have an impaired sympathetic response following HDBR. However, the results from the current investigation imply that F maintain the ability to respond to sympathetic stimulation but may not be able to adequately activate a proper response following HDBR.","[{""submissionId"":20090039033,""id"":""fdb16931a5464f2594a8ff9231dada6c"",""publicationDate"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""United States"",""submissionId"":20090039033,""endDate"":""2010-06-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""name"":""American College of Sports Medicine Annual Meeting"",""location"":""Baltimore, MD"",""id"":""76e7f3dd78d74e6c8962e47609f9c483"",""startDate"":""2010-06-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20090039033
20040088028,REPRINT,Effects of hindlimb unweighting on the mechanical and structure properties of the rat abdominal aorta,"[""Papadopoulos, Anthony"",""Delp, Michael D.""]","Previous studies have shown that hindlimb unweighting of rats, a model of microgravity, reduces evoked contractile tension of peripheral conduit arteries. It has been hypothesized that this diminished contractile tension is the result of alterations in the mechanical properties of these arteries (e.g., active and passive mechanics). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether the reduced contractile force of the abdominal aorta from 2-wk hindlimb-unweighted (HU) rats results from a mechanical function deficit resulting from structural vascular alterations or material property changes. Aortas were isolated from control (C) and HU rats, and vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine (10(-9)-10(-4) M) and AVP (10(-9)-10(-5) M) were tested in vitro. In a second series of tests, the active and passive Cauchy stress-stretch relations were determined by incrementally increasing the uniaxial displacement of the aortic rings. Maximal Cauchy stress in response to norepinephrine and AVP were less in aortic rings from HU rats. The active Cauchy stress-stretch response indicated that, although maximum stress was lower in aortas from HU rats (C, 8.1 +/- 0.2 kPa; HU, 7.0 +/- 0.4 kPa), it was achieved at a similar hoop stretch. There were also no differences in the passive Cauchy stress-stretch response or the gross vascular morphology (e.g., medial cross-sectional area: C, 0.30 +/- 0.02 mm(2); HU, 0.32 +/- 0.01 mm(2)) between groups and no differences in resting or basal vascular tone at the displacement that elicits peak developed tension between groups (resting tension: C, 1.71 +/- 0.06 g; HU, 1.78 +/- 0.14 g). These results indicate that HU does not alter the functional mechanical properties of conduit arteries. However, the significantly lower active Cauchy stress of aortas from HU rats demonstrates a true contractile deficit in these arteries.","[{""volume"":""94"",""submissionId"":20040088028,""issue"":""2"",""issn"":""8750-7587"",""id"":""e6b9652a92cc43b98fc6d274984d53d4"",""publicationName"":""Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. :  1985)"",""publicationDate"":""2003-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088028
20240011576,ABSTRACT,Next Generation Exercise Device (NGED): Advancing Exercise Capabilities for Future Space Missions Through Biomechanical Modeling,"[""C Wang"",""K H Lostroscio"",""C A Bell"",""L Quinto"",""C Beck"",""E Benia"",""L J Quiocho"",""L B Nilsson""]","BACKGROUND
As space exploration extends to long-duration missions on the Moon and Mars, maintaining astronaut health and fitness becomes increasingly critical. The Next Generation Exercise Device (NGED), developed and tested by the HumanWorks Lab in NASA Johnson Space Center's (JSC) Software, Robotics, and Simulation Division, aims to address this challenge through innovative approaches. This study presents the development and evaluation of an NGED system, focusing on its adaptability to various mission scenarios, including prospective use in a Lunar Pressurized Rover (LPR). Central to this project is the application of biomechanical modeling to optimize exercise efficacy and safety in microgravity and partial gravity environments. The project is a collaborative effort with the Human Health and Performance group at Johnson Space Center, ensuring a comprehensive approach to astronaut well-being that integrates biomechanical principles with practical exercise solutions. The NGED represents the next generation of exercise capabilities for missions in space, on the Moon and Mars, with a specific focus on applications such as the LPR.

METHODS AND RESULTS
Data collection for NGED development was conducted with two motor-driven Beyond Power Voltra I [1] systems and a custom test structure to allow placement of the cable-based devices on the ground, at shoulder height, and overhead. The collection was performed in JSC’s Prototype Immersive Technology (PIT) Lab, utilizing an OptiTrack motion capture system and AMTI force platform, to enable detailed biomechanical analysis via OpenSim [2,3]. Motion capture data were collected for three subjects representing different body types and statures. The marker set used was an enhanced version of the full-body Plug-in Gait marker set [4], with additional markers strategically placed for the primary objective of informing exercise volume requirements. Subjects performed a series of 17 exercises, carefully selected to engage various muscle groups, including novel spaceflight exercises such as skiing (ergometer style), lateral pulldowns, wood chops, triceps extensions, and flies, with load variations ranging from 10 to 90 pounds to maintain kinematic form. This comprehensive approach allowed for a thorough evaluation of the NGED's performance across a wide range of motions and loads. The biomechanical modeling and analysis were conducted using a modified OpenSim Full Body Rajagopal Model [4,5] and also scaled to the maximum and minimum anthropometry provided in NASA-STD-3001 [6]. Volumetric convex hulls were generated based on model marker trajectories and aggregated into geometric assemblies. These can be placed in models of vehicle designs to assess fit to protect for exercise as well as to adapt NGED exercise to fit available space. Preliminary findings from the collection indicate that the NGED prototype demonstrates significant adaptability across varying user anthropometrics and exercise types. The device showed consistent performance in load-bearing exercises, with subjects able to perform exercises effectively while maintaining proper biomechanical form. 

CONCLUSION 
NGED represents a forward-looking advancement in exercise capabilities for future space missions. In the future, this system can be used to capture valuable metrics (e.g., isometric mid-thigh pull for force output measurements, assessments of postural muscle strength, overall isometric strength). Its versatility in accommodating various exercises and user physiques, coupled with the ability to provide targeted biomechanical loading, makes it a promising approach for maintaining astronaut health during long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. Future work will focus on refining the NGED based on initial biomechanical findings, leveraging the detailed insights provided by motion capture and analysis techniques. Particular emphasis will be placed on optimizing its use within the confined spaces of a LPR and other space habitats.

NASA’s GeneLab provides access to omics datasets generated from spaceflight and ground-based experiments allowing for additional retrospective analysis. We used GeneLab’s GLDS-203, a dataset generated by researchers at Loma Linda University to study the impact of prolonged unloading and/or low-dose radiation on mouse retina. The purpose of this study was to understand the effect of gamma radiation and/or hindlimb unloading on mice retinas through a multi-omics analysis. In the experiment that generated the omics data, mice were irradiated with gamma-ray and/or subjected to hindlimb unloading for 21 days and multi-omics analysis was performed at 7 days, 1 month, or 4 months post exposure. In the current study, for each of the three timepoints, we compared epigenomic profiles for retinas from exposed mice against timepoint-matched controls. We identified a total of 5,271 differentially methylated loci (DML) and 321 differentially methylated regions (DMR; using a sliding window and step size of 500 bp) with methylation difference > 10% and q-value < 0.05 (sliding linear model corrected p-value) across the nine exposure groups. Highest correlation in methylation difference was seen for significant DMLs (q-value < 0.05) across different conditions at same post exposure timepoint (Figure 1).The location of DMLs and DMRs were characterized with respect to CpG islands and shores, putative promoters, gene body, and intergenic regions (Table 1).
We analyzed RNA-seq counts and performed gene set enrichment analysis using differential expression results from comparing each exposure group to its timepoint-matched control group. Significant pathways (adjusted p-value <0.05) enriched in all three microgravity-only groups were related to morphogenesis of a branching epithelium, skeletal muscle cell differentiation, and response to fibroblast growth factor. Common processes across all timepoints in the radiation-only groups were retina homeostasis, synaptic vesicle exocytosis-endocytosis, and chemotaxis. In the combination groups, regulation of trans-synaptic signaling, and Rho protein signal transduction were enriched at all three timepoints. Processes related to purine nucleotide metabolism were enriched in all nine exposure groups, with activation at 1 month, and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. A total of 14 genes contained at least one DML and were differentially expressed at adjusted p-value < 0.05, including genes implicated in cataract development (Sipa1l3, Crybb3) and those involved in cytoskeletal organization (Plec, Flnb, Eef1a1).

20230013939,CONFERENCE_PAPER,3D Scanning System to Assess Gravity-Dependent Body Shape Changes,"[""K H Kim"",""S P Sabahi"",""L Q Vu"",""S L Rajulu""]","The human body shows unique physiological and morphological changes when exposed to different gravity conditions, including muscle atrophy, fluid shift, spinal elongation, and body posture adjustments. Such changes need to be incorporated for human-system integration in the vehicle habitat, garment, and spacesuit designs, as inaccurate body measurements can result in suboptimal crew protection that can potentially decrease injury tolerance. However, the traditional linear measurements, such as stature, segment lengths or circumferences measured using a caliper or tape measure, often show limited consistency and are unable to capture the nonlinear characteristics of the human body. While 3D body scanning can provide significant advantages over linear measurements, the technologies have not been fully developed or customized for in-flight scanning. For ground laboratory use, several different scanner types are commercially available. However, in-flight scanning requires additional technical considerations, such as minimal scan time, simplified calibration, and sufficient capture volume.

This work aims to develop a prototype 3-D body scanning system that is customized for in-flight use to scan crewmembers, with the configuration and performance optimized for detecting known gravity-dependent body shape and posture changes. A hardware system will be custom built using a network of commercial off-the-shelf 3D sensors. The sensor parameters and settings will be optimized to detect the targeted body shape changes, specifically using body manikins of which the shape and size are iteratively permuted to simulate the known changes by fluid shift and spinal elongation. The capture volume will be also matched for a range of body sizes from a 1st percentile female to 99th percentile male. Unintentional body motions or floating in microgravity will be also simulated and incorporated. A data acquisition software will be developed for efficient in-flight operations with minimal overhead and easy-to-use user interface. A simplified calibration procedure will be designed for robust scanning against frequent vibration or unexpected sensor position shifts. 

The system will be tested in the ground laboratory for accuracy and reliability against a reference scanning system. New anthropometry measurements will be also identified to sensitively capture the gravity dependent body shape changes, in addition to the traditional anthropometry measurements.

20240001000,POSTER,3D Scanning System to Assess Gravity-Dependent Body Shape Changes,"[""K H Kim"",""S P Sabahi"",""D Nguyen"",""L Q Vu"",""N Newby""]","The human body shows unique physiological and morphological changes when exposed to different gravity conditions, including muscle atrophy, fluid shift, spinal elongation, and body posture adjustments. Such changes need to be incorporated for human-system integration in the vehicle habitat, garment, and spacesuit designs, as inaccurate body measurements can result in suboptimal crew protection that can potentially decrease injury tolerance. However, the traditional linear measurements, such as stature, segment lengths or circumferences measured using a caliper or tape measure, often show limited consistency and are unable to capture the nonlinear characteristics of the human body. While 3D body scanning can provide significant advantages over linear measurements, the technologies have not been fully developed or customized for in-flight scanning. For ground laboratory use, several different scanner types are commercially available. However, in-flight scanning requires additional technical considerations, such as minimal scan time, simplified calibration, and sufficient capture volume.

This work aims to develop a prototype 3-D body scanning system that is customized for in-flight use to scan crewmembers, with the configuration and performance optimized for detecting known gravity-dependent body shape and posture changes. A hardware system will be custom built using a network of commercial off-the-shelf 3D sensors. The sensor parameters and settings will be optimized to detect the targeted body shape changes, specifically using body manikins of which the shape and size are iteratively permuted to simulate the known changes by fluid shift and spinal elongation. The capture volume will be also matched for a range of body sizes from a 1st percentile female to 99th percentile male. Unintentional body motions or floating in microgravity will be also simulated and incorporated. A data acquisition software will be developed for efficient in-flight operations with minimal overhead and easy-to-use user interface. A simplified calibration procedure will be designed for robust scanning against frequent vibration or unexpected sensor position shifts. 

The system will be tested in the ground laboratory for accuracy and reliability against a reference scanning system. New anthropometry measurements will be also identified to sensitively capture the gravity dependent body shape changes, in addition to the traditional anthropometry measurements. A novel landmark-based technique will be tested for consistent anthropometry measurements across posture variations. If successfully developed and deployed, the new system is expected to provide previously unavailable body shape and size data from different gravitational environments, including 0-g, 1/6-g, and 1-g.

20040088497,REPRINT,The exercise and environmental physiology of extravehicular activity,"[""Cowell, Stephenie A."",""Stocks, Jodie M."",""Evans, David G."",""Simonson, Shawn R."",""Greenleaf, John E.""]","Extravehicular activity (EVA), i.e., exercise performed under unique environmental conditions, is indispensable for supporting daily living in weightlessness and for further space exploration. From 1965-1996 an average of 20 h x yr(-1) were spent performing EVA. International Space Station (ISS) assembly will require 135 h x yr(-1) of EVA, and 138 h x yr(-1) is planned for post-construction maintenance. The extravehicular mobility unit (EMU), used to protect astronauts during EVA, has a decreased pressure of 4.3 psi that could increase astronauts' risk of decompression sickness (DCS). Exercise in and repeated exposure to this hypobaria may increase the incidence of DCS, although weightlessness may attenuate this risk. Exercise thermoregulation within the EMU is poorly understood; the liquid cooling garment (LCG), worn next to the skin and designed to handle thermal stress, is manually controlled. Astronauts may become dehydrated (by up to 2.6% of body weight) during a 5-h EVA, further exacerbating the thermoregulatory challenge. The EVA is performed mainly with upper body muscles; but astronauts usually exercise at only 26-32% of their upper body maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). For a given ground-based work task in air (as opposed to water), the submaximal VO2 is greater while VO2max and metabolic efficiency are lower during ground-based arm exercise as compared with leg exercise, and cardiovascular responses to exercise and training are also different for arms and legs. Preflight testing and training, whether conducted in air or water, must account for these differences if ground-based data are extrapolated for flight requirements. Astronauts experience deconditioning during microgravity resulting in a 10-20% loss in arm strength, a 20-30% loss in thigh strength, and decreased lower-body aerobic exercise capacity. Data from ground-based simulations of weightlessness such as bed rest induce a 6-8% decrease in upper-body strength, a 10-16% loss in thigh extensor strength, and a 15-20% decrease in lower-body aerobic exercise capacity. Changes in EVA support systems and training based on a greater understanding of the physiological aspects of exercise in the EVA environment will help to insure the health, safety, and efficiency of working astronauts.","[{""volume"":""73"",""submissionId"":20040088497,""issue"":""1"",""issn"":""0095-6562"",""id"":""8a3d2ad8504c4ce8a273390e987525e8"",""publicationName"":""Aviation, space, and environmental medicine"",""publicationDate"":""2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040088497

E."",""Kozlovskaya, I."",""Washburn, D. A."",""Fanton, J. W."",""Edgerton, V. R."",""Rumbaugh, D. M.""]","Effects of spaceflight on Rhesus quadrupedal locomotion after return to 1G. Locomotor performance, activation patterns of the soleus (Sol), medial gastrocnemius (MG), vastus lateralis (VL), and tibialis anterior (TA) and MG tendon force during quadrupedal stepping were studied in adult Rhesus before and after 14 days of either spaceflight (n = 2) or flight simulation at 1G (n = 3). Flight simulation involved duplication of the spaceflight conditions and experimental protocol in a 1G environment. Postflight, but not postsimulation, electromyographic (EMG) recordings revealed clonus-like activity in all muscles. Compared with preflight, the cycle period and burst durations of the primary extensors (Sol, MG, and VL) tended to decrease postflight. These decreases were associated with shorter steps. The flexor (TA) EMG burst duration postflight was similar to preflight, whereas the burst amplitude was elevated. Consequently, the Sol:TA and MG:TA EMG amplitude ratios were lower following flight, reflecting a ""flexor bias."" Together, these alterations in mean EMG amplitudes reflect differential adaptations in motor-unit recruitment patterns of flexors and extensors as well as fast and slow motor pools. Shorter cycle period and burst durations persisted throughout the 20-day postflight testing period, whereas mean EMG returned to preflight levels by 17 days postflight. Compared with presimulation, the simulation group showed slight increases in the cycle period and burst durations of all muscles. Mean EMG amplitude decreased in the Sol, increased in the MG and VL, and was unchanged in the TA. Thus adaptations observed postsimulation were different from those observed postflight, indicating that there was a response unique to the microgravity environment, i.e., the modulations in the nervous system controlling locomotion cannot merely be attributed to restriction of movement but appear to be the result of changes in the interpretation of load-related proprioceptive feedback to the nervous system. Peak MG tendon force amplitudes were approximately two times greater post- compared with preflight or presimulation. Adaptations in tendon force and EMG amplitude ratios indicate that the nervous system undergoes a reorganization of the recruitment patterns biased toward an increased recruitment of fast versus slow motor units and flexor versus extensor muscles. Combined, these data indicate that some details of the control of motor pools during locomotion are dependent on the persistence of Earth's gravitational environment.","[{""volume"":""81"",""submissionId"":20040141964,""issue"":""5"",""issn"":""0022-3077"",""id"":""b3d4632bbe044ae6bd94f44d54c0e58c"",""publicationName"":""Journal of neurophysiology"",""publicationDate"":""1999-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040141964
19940009294,OTHER,Manual control in space research on perceptual-motor functions under zero gravity conditions (L-10),"[""Tada, Akira""]","Are human abilities to control vehicles and other machines the same in space as those on Earth? The L-10 Manual Control Experiment of the First Materials Processing Tests (FMPT) started from this question. Suppose a pilot has the task to align the head of a space vehicle toward a target. His actions are to look at the target, to determine the vehicle movement, and to operate the manipulator. If the activity of the nervous system were the same as on Earth, the movements, of the eye and hand would become excessive because the muscles do not have to oppose gravity. The timing and amount of movement must be arranged for appropriate actions. The sensation of motion would also be affected by the loss of gravity because the mechanism of the otolith, the major acceleration sensor, depends on gravity. The possible instability of the sensation of direction may cause mistakes in the direction of control of manipulator movement. Thus, the experimental data can be used for designing man-machine systems in space, as well as for investigation of physiological mechanisms. In this experiment, the direction of vehicle heading is expressed by a light spot on an array of light emitting diodes and the manipulator is of a finger stick type. As the light spot moves up and down, the Japanese Payload Specialist, and the subject, must move the manipulator forward and backward to keep the movement of the light spot within the neighborhood of the central point of the display. The position of the light spot is computed in such a manner that when the stick is kept at the neutral position, a motion whose acceleration is proportional to the angle of deflection is added to the movement of the light spot. The Operator Describing Function, which is an expression of human control characteristics, can be calculated from 2 minutes of raw data of the light spot position and stick deflection. The 2 minutes of operation is called a run, and 8 runs with resting periods composes a session. The on-orbit experiment will be conducted on the second, fourth, and seventh days. One session of experiment of each of these days is conducted following the L-4 experiment, which uses the same apparatus. The Payload Specialist, aided by a Mission Specialist, will take our apparatus from a rack container, set up the apparatus, attach electrodes for measurements of eye movement and muscle activity, conduct the L-4 Visual Stability Experiment, conduct one session of the manual control experiment, and then dissemble and stow the apparatus. In addition to the flight experiment, pre-flight and post-flight experiments will be conducted. The data of three sessions on orbit will reflect adaption of physiological systems to microgravity. The data of post-flight experiments, on the other hand, will reflect re-adaptation of physiological systems to the gravity condition on the ground. Control data collected with and without psychological tension will be scheduled just prior to and long before launch.","[{""submissionId"":19940009294,""id"":""1fbfcb4749964782a65144342fc0ba4a"",""publicationName"":""NASA.

J.""]","Exposure to the microgravity conditions of spaceflight causes astronauts to experience alterations in multiple physiological systems. These physiological changes include sensorimotor disturbances, cardiovascular deconditioning, and loss of muscle mass and strength. Some or all of these changes might affect the ability of crewmembers to perform critical mission tasks immediately after landing on a planetary surface. The goals of the Functional Task Test (FTT) study were to determine the effects of spaceflight on functional tests that are representative of critical exploration mission tasks and to identify the key physiological factors that contribute to decrements in performance. The FTT was comprised of seven functional tests and a corresponding set of interdisciplinary physiological measures targeting the sensorimotor, cardiovascular and muscular changes associated with exposure to spaceflight. Both Shuttle and ISS crewmembers participated in this study. Additionally, we conducted a supporting study using the FTT protocol on subjects before and after 70 days of 6 head-down bed rest. The bed rest analog allowed us to investigate the impact of body unloading in isolation on both functional tasks and on the underlying physiological factors that lead to decrements in performance, and then to compare them with the results obtained in our spaceflight study. Spaceflight data were collected on three sessions before flight, on landing day (Shuttle only) and 1, 6 and 30 days after landing. Bed rest subjects were tested three times before bed rest and immediately after getting up from bed rest as well as 1, 6, and 12 days after reambulation. We have shown that for Shuttle, ISS and bed rest subjects, functional tasks requiring a greater demand for dynamic control of postural equilibrium (i.e. fall recovery, seat egress/obstacle avoidance during walking, object translation, jump down) showed the greatest decrement in performance. Functional tests with reduced requirements for postural stability (i.e. hatch opening, ladder climb, manual manipulation of objects and tool use) showed little reduction in performance. These changes in functional performance were paralleled by similar decrements in sensorimotor tests designed to specifically assess postural equilibrium and dynamic gait control. Bed rest subjects experienced similar deficits both in functional tests with balance challenges and in sensorimotor tests designed to evaluate postural and gait control as spaceflight subjects indicating that body support unloading experienced during spaceflight plays a central role in post-flight alteration of functional task performance. To determine how differences in body-support loading experienced during in-flight treadmill exercise affect postflight functional performance, the loading history for each subject during in-flight treadmill (T2) exercise was correlated with postflight measures of performance. ISS crewmembers who walked on the treadmill with higher pull-down loads had enhanced post-flight performance on tests requiring mobility. Taken together the spaceflight and bed rest data point to the importance of supplementing inflight exercise countermeasures with balance and sensorimotor adaptability training. These data also support the notion that inflight treadmill exercise performed with higher body loading provides sensorimotor benefits leading to improved performance on functional tasks that require dynamic postural stability and mobility.","[{""submissionId"":20150003044,""id"":""36622ab0dea541b4936df09fba579986"",""publicationDate"":""2015-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""submissionId"":20150003044,""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Paris, France"",""id"":""1c16b29df1a248438cef7501e51b9a67""},{""country"":""Czechoslovakia"",""submissionId"":20150003044,""endDate"":""2015-07-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""70d62bd05bc24b65a90f9ec757ecc6ab"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""Czech Space Office"",""location"":""Prague, Czech Republic""}},""meetingId"":""c46b05ccc9c14ff4b78b57cf5df49843"",""id"":""ab19a39edd9f4b43a063a9d4ac84d672""},{""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""International Academy of Astronautics"",""location"":""Paris, France""}},""meetingId"":""c46b05ccc9c14ff4b78b57cf5df49843"",""id"":""11f51e97b7084398a16f9a258bc6814d""}],""name"":""Humans in Space Symposium (HIS)"",""location"":""Prague"",""id"":""c46b05ccc9c14ff4b78b57cf5df49843"",""startDate"":""2015-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Man/System Technology And Life Support"",""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150003044
20250002737,TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM,Concern of Intervertebral Disc Damage Upon and Immediately After Re-Exposure to Gravity (Inactive),"[""Jean D Sibonga""]","There is an increased incidence of back pain expressed by crewmembers in space. Additionally, herniated Intervertebral Discs (IVD) have been diagnosed in returning Skylab and Shuttle astronauts on landing day, and after varying periods of time in the postflight period. Such injuries in astronauts, however, may be related to their careers as aviators (either high performance jet pilots and/or helicopter pilots). However, the evidence of IVD injuries raises the concern that astronauts are at increased risk during loading scenarios experienced during or after exploration missions (for example, re-entry to a gravitational field, activities on planetary surfaces).

To date, flight data related to potential back injuries have focused upon spine elongation and the well-established effects of mechanical unloading on intervertebral discs (IVDs). IVDs are the articulating connective tissue between vertebral bodies of the spinal column where the IVD acts as a shock absorber to the mechanical loads experienced in the axial direction. The connective tissue of joints is devoid of vasculature so exchanges between nutrients and waste products are accomplished by the influx and efflux of fluid. In general, the diurnal fluctuations in IVD volume of the spine are induced as the individual transitions between sleep (supine) and ambulation (upright), although the spine is subjected to a variety of mechanical forces with daily activities in 1 G. However, during prolonged bed rest or spaceflight, the absence of axial and muscular loading to the spine causes the IVDs to swell with increased fluid intake. Consequently, the changes in IVD volume were considered major factors for the elongation of the spine, the increase in height and the loss of lordotic curvature. IVD changes may also account for the occurrence of back pain, although the exact cause for the latter is not well defined. Tissue analyses of animals, mechanically unloaded in space and ground-based models, reveal changes in IVD biochemical composition. Spaceflight-induced changes to IVDs may predispose the IVD to injury during reloading. No flight studies have investigated whether a specific exercise regimen, performed during real or simulated weightlessness, can effectively impart axial loads to the human spine to mimic the diurnal changes in IVD volume experienced on Earth. Restoration of IVD volume, after spaceflight and bed rest, has been observed with return to upright position in a 1-G environment, but the recovery time course has not been systematically assessed. Likewise, IVD biochemical and biomechanical properties, before and after spaceflight, have not been investigated.

In brief, extended exposures to microgravity are associated with increased reports of back pain during flight and may be related to the occurrence of IVD herniations in astronauts after flight. The etiology for these observations may be multi-factorial given the number of documented physiological risk factors induced in space, which include muscle atrophy, tissue degeneration, bone fracture and accelerated bone loss. Thus, further investigations are needed to generate more evidence to better define the risk.","[{""submissionId"":20250002737,""publisher"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""id"":""0a43c6646e9a4d8faf0e804b96972042"",""publicationDate"":""2025-03-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""012556.02.04.24.04""]",undefined,"[""Aerospace Medicine""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20250002737
20040089930,REPRINT,Spacelab Life Sciences flight experiments:  an integrated approach to the study of cardiovascular deconditioning and orthostatic hypotension,"[""Gaffney, F. A.""]","The microgravity environment of spaceflight produces rapid cardiovascular changes which are adaptive and appropriate in that setting, but are associated with significant deconditioning and orthostatic hypotension on return to Earth's gravity.  The rapidity with which these space flight induced changes appear and disappear provides an ideal model for studying the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of deconditioning and orthostatic hypotension, regardless of etiology.  Since significant deconditioning is seen after flights of very short duration, muscle atrophy due to inactivity plays, at most, a small role.  These changes in circulatory control associated with cephalad fluid shifts, rather than inactivity per se, are probably more important factors.  In order to test this hypothesis in a systematic way, a multidisciplinary approach which defines and integrates inputs and responses from a wide variety of circulatory sub-systems is required.  The cardiovascular experiments selected for Spacelab Life Sciences flights 1 and 2 provide such an approach.  Both human and animal models will be utilized.  Pre- and post-flight characterization of the payload crew includes determination of maximal exercise capacity (bicycle ergometry), orthostatic tolerance (lower body negative pressure), alpha and beta adrenergic sensitivity (isoproterenol and phenylephrine infusions), baroreflex sensitivity (ECG-gated, stepwise changes in carotid artery transmural pressure with a pneumatic neck collar), and responses to a 24 h period of 5 deg head-down tilt.  Measurements of cardiac output (CO2 and C2H2 rebreathing), cardiac chamber dimensions (phased-array 2-dimensional echocardiography), direct central venous pressure, leg volume (Thornton sock), limb blood flow and venous compliance (occlusion plethysmography), blood and plasma volumes, renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates, and various hormonal levels including catecholamines and atrial natriuretic factor will also be obtained.  The central venous catheter will be inserted immediately pre-launch and monitored with heart rate and blood pressure in-flight until cardiac output, respiratory gas exchange and quantitative 2D echocardiography measurements can be performed.  In-flight hemodynamic measurements will be repeated at rest and during submaximal exercise daily and also during maximal exercise midway through the flight to document the timecourse and extent of cardiovascular changes in the payload crew.  Parallel studies are planned for the animals.  In addition to measurements of right atrial and aortic pressures and cardiac output, a dorsal micro-circulatory chamber will allow determinations of changes in capillary and venular architecture and function in six of the rats.  The techniques and findings from many of the SLS-1 and 2 supporting studies have already yielded significant information about circulatory regulation in patients with both hypo- and hypertension.  The flight experiments themselves will provide new data to test the validity of both animal and human models currently used for simulating the fluid shifts of a micro-gravity environment.  The development of effective countermeasures, not only for short and long duration space travellers, but also for Earth-bound medical patients can then be physiologically based on experimental data rather than anecdote.","[{""volume"":""15"",""submissionId"":20040089930,""issue"":""5"",""issn"":""0094-5765"",""id"":""31e011def19d462a82385c11b99ab6d0"",""publicationName"":""Acta astronautica"",""publicationDate"":""1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,[],undefined,"[""Life Sciences (General)""]",[],https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040089930
20250000209,POSTER,3D Scanning System to Assess Gravity-Dependent Body Shape Changes,"[""K H Kim"",""S P Sabahi"",""D Nguyen"",""N Newby""]","The human body shows unique morphological changes when exposed to different gravity conditions, including muscle atrophy, fluid shift, and spinal elongation. Such changes need to be incorporated for human-system integration in the vehicle habitat, garment, and spacesuit designs, as inaccurate body measurements can result in suboptimal crew protection that can potentially decrease injury tolerance. However, measurement tools have not been available for accurate assessments of body shape changes. 

This work aimed to develop a prototype 3-D body scanning system with the configuration and performance optimized for in-flight crewmember body scanning. A scan hardware system was developed using Intel RealSense commercial off-the-shelf 3D sensors. The sensor parameters were iteratively optimized and tested to obtain the performance level needed for body scanning. A scan booth structure was fabricated, with the overall size 4 x 4 x 8 feet. The specific number of sensors and mounting positions were determined by iterative simulations, which indicated that 16 cameras can capture 94% and 96% of body surface area from the 1st percentile female and 99th percentile male crew population subject. The mounted sensors were linked through a mix of USB-C and USB-3 cables and operated for data acquisition from a Linux laptop computer. A software prototype was developed using Python and Tkinter graphical user interface toolkit. A calibration procedure was also built using a panel of QR codes. A computer vision tool detected and decoded the unique ID and pattern locations of the QR codes. The calibration information determined the position and orientation of the 3D sensors with respect to each other. 

The scanner performance was assessed using a set of 3D printed custom manikins. The manikin size and shape were derived from the previous ISS study, which measured the crewmembers’ anthropometry changes across the different flight phases. The average anthropometric measurements at the pre-flight and flight day 15 were sampled and projected onto the 1st percentile female and 99th percentile male body shapes. Another pair of manikins were also 3D printed to simulate the neutral body posture, estimated from ISS microgravity environments. 

A preliminary analysis assessed the performance of the newly developed scanner against the reference scanner, which has been used at the NASA JSC for crew and test subject anthropometry. Although the new scanner data showed several artifacts and missing geometries in the occluded body areas such as armpits and crotch, overall shape matched with the reference scan. When the manikin surface coordinates were compared, a root mean square error of 1.3 cm was observed from the manikin torso segment. Linear measurements including the stature, knee height and circumference measurements at the chest and calf showed differences from the reference scan measurements, ranging between 0.3 and 0.9 cm. 

Overall, this work demonstrated a development framework for an in-flight scanner with design and operation optimized for crewmember body scanning. Further improvement can potentially provide previously unavailable anthropometric data from different gravitational environments, including 0-g, 1/6-g, and 1-g. Such data can improve suit fit, habitat design, exercise efficacy quantification and sizing of orthostatic intolerance garments.

20080029379,ABSTRACT,Development of a Countermeasure to Mitigate Postflight Locomotor Dysfunction,"[""Bloomberg, J. J."",""Mulavara, A. P."",""Peters, B. T."",""Cohen, H. S."",""Richards, J. T."",""Miller, C. A."",""Brady, R."",""Warren, L. E."",""Ruttley, T. M.""]","Astronauts returning from space flight experience locomotor dysfunction following their return to Earth. Our laboratory is currently developing a gait adaptability training program that is designed to facilitate recovery of locomotor function following a return to a gravitational environment. The training program exploits the ability of the sensorimotor system to generalize from exposure to multiple adaptive challenges during training so that the gait control system essentially learns to learn and therefore can reorganize more rapidly when faced with a novel adaptive challenge. Evidence for the potential efficacy of an adaptive generalization gait training program can be obtained from numerous studies in the motor learning literature which have demonstrated that systematically varying the conditions of training enhances the ability of the performer to learn and retain a novel motor task. These variable practice training approaches have been used in applied contexts to improve motor skills required in a number of different sports. The central nervous system (CNS) can produce voluntary movement in an almost infinite number of ways. For example, locomotion can be achieved with many different combinations of joint angles, muscle activation patterns and forces. The CNS can exploit these degrees of freedom to enhance motor response adaptability during periods of adaptive flux like that encountered during a change in gravitational environment. Ultimately, the functional goal of an adaptive generalization countermeasure is not necessarily to immediately return movement patterns back to normal. Rather the training regimen should facilitate the reorganization of available sensory and motor subsystems to achieve safe and effective locomotion as soon as possible after long duration space flight. Indeed, this approach has been proposed as a basic feature underlying effective neurological rehabilitation. We have previously confirmed that subjects participating in an adaptive generalization training program using a variety of visuomotor distortions and throwing as the dependent measure can learn to enhance their ability to adapt to a novel sensorimotor environment (Roller et al., 2001). Importantly, this increased adaptability was retained even one month after completion of the training period. Adaptive generalization has been observed in a variety of other tasks requiring sensorimotor transformations including manual control tasks and reaching (Bock et al., 2001, Seidler, 2003) and obstacle avoidance during walking (Lam and Dietz, 2004). Taken together, the evidence suggests that a training regimen exposing crewmembers to variation in locomotor conditions, with repeated transitions among states, may enhance their ability to learn how to reassemble appropriate locomotor patterns upon return from microgravity. We believe exposure to this type of training will extend crewmembers locomotor behavioral repertoires, facilitating the return of functional mobility after long duration space flight. In other words, our proposed training protocol will compel subjects to develop new behavioral solutions under varying sensorimotor demands. Over time subjects will learn to create appropriate locomotor solution more rapidly enabling acquisition of mobility sooner after long-duration space flight. A gait adaptability training program can be superimposed on nominal treadmill exercise activities thus ensuring that no additional crew time is required to perform this type of training regimen and that it can be implemented with current in-flight exercise systems available on the International Space Station.","[{""submissionId"":20080029379,""id"":""ca68010fdeac42b5b1798208ee1db8d3"",""publicationDate"":""2006-06-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]","[{""country"":""Netherlands"",""submissionId"":20080029379,""endDate"":""2006-06-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"",""sponsors"":[{""organizationId"":""31bde51a85114056acc223d9a5eb86fc"",""meta"":{""organization"":{""name"":""European Space Agency.

Each year, one issue of the Journal is devoted to the Annual Meeting Proceedings, and up to four more issues are comprised of full-length research papers. Additionally, Supplement Issues are considered by the Editorial Board as they are submitted. The Journal is published for the International Society for Gravitational Physiology by the Galileo Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit public benefit corporation. This issue, the first number of 2006, comprises the Proceedings of the joint meeting of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology s 27th Annual International Gravitational Physiology Meeting, held in Osaka, Japan 23- 28 April, 2006. The Journal of Gravitational Physiology invites the submission of original experimental or observational papers on subjects in the field of gravitational physiology. Review articles, theoretical papers and historical or biographical articles will also be solicited by the Editor for publication. The wide scientific span of the Journal rests on physiology as its keystone. Gravitational physiology is considered to include the effects of changes in the magnitude and directions of the gravitational force environment on cells and physiological systems and behavior of humans, animals and plants.

The program was conducted by the University of Alabama and MSFC during the period May 28, 1996 through August 2, 1996. Operated under the auspices of the American Society for Engineering Education, the MSFC program, as well as those at other NASA centers, was sponsored by the Higher Education Branch, Education Division, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. The basic objectives of the programs, which are in the 33rd year of operation nationally, are (1) to further the professional knowledge of qualified engineering and science faculty members; (2) to stimulate an exchange of ideas between participants and NASA; (3) to enrich and refresh the research and teaching activities of the participants' institutions; and (4) to contribute to the research objectives of the NASA centers. The Faculty Fellows spent 10 weeks at MSFC engaged in a research project compatible with their interests and background and worked in collaboration with a NASA/MSFC colleague. This document is a compilation of Fellows' reports on their research during the summer of 1996. The University of Alabama presents the Co-Directors' report on the administrative operations of the program. Further information can be obtained by contacting any of the editors.","[{""submissionId"":19980206153,""id"":""17d56ca97fbb41a19a5beb9ce19ad3ae"",""publicationDate"":""1996-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00""}]",[],PUBLIC,"[""NGT8-52819""]",undefined,"[""Social
